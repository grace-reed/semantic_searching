<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Chromera velia is a spherical green-brown alga found associated with corals in Australian reefs. Phylogenetic analysis of this seemingly insignificant organism found that it holds a unique relationship in the tree of life. C. velia is related to dinoflagellates, a large and diverse group of aquatic algae that live in freshwater and marine environments. Roughly half of the dinoflagellate species are photosynthetic, while the other half is strictly heterotrophic <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gaines &amp; Elbrachter, 1987)</ref>. Many dinoflagellate species form symbiotic relationships with invertebrates and protists, such as Symbiodinium, a coral endosymbiont <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Murray &amp; Patterson, 2004)</ref>. Surprisingly, the other closest known relatives to C. velia are the Apicomplexa, a large and diverse group of obligate intracellular parasites. Many apicomplexan species are capable of causing serious diseases in human and animal hosts; well-known diseases include malaria (caused by Plasmodium spp.), toxoplasmosis (caused by Toxoplasma gondii), and coccidiosis in poultry (caused by Eimera) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Oborník, Janouškovec, Chrudimsky, &amp; Lukeš, 2009)</ref>. The effects of these protists on humans and domesticated animals are substantial economic losses worldwide and a devastating loss of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kim, 2004)</ref>. It had long been proposed that the Apicomplexa had algal ancestors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cavalier-Smith, 1993)</ref>, but the discovery of C. velia provides a direct insight into what this ancestor may have looked like. Since the discovery of C. velia, its algal and parasitic properties have been explored to better understand the evolutionary shift from a photosynthetic autotroph to a parasite. The idea that the precursor to the malarial parasite was a harmless photosynthetic algae living at the bottom of the sea is both mystifying and thought-provoking. Better understanding of this missing link in the evolutionary chain allows a new perspective on these parasites that continue to cause havoc to civilization, and, perhaps, will provide us with the necessary insight to control them. This review will focus on the ecology and biology of C. velia and its significance in understanding the evolution of parasitism.</p><p>2. THE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF C. VELIA 2.1. The discovery of C. velia C. velia was first found in 2001 associated with the stony corals Plesiastrea versipora from Sydney Harbor, New South Wales, Australia, and Leptastrea purpurea from One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Moore, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moore et al., 2008)</ref>. C. velia was isolated during attempts to culture Symbiodinium, the major intracellular symbiont of these cnidarians. Moore adapted the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">York (1986)</ref> to select for Symbiodinium by first surface-sterilizing freshly collected coral "nubbins" in a pH-neutralized 1:25 bleach in seawater solution to kill any adherent algae, bacteria, or predatory ciliates. The assumption was Symbiodinium, which can be isolated from the feces of fish that have grazed on coral, would have a high tolerance to the oxidants, and would therefore be able to survive the action of bleach. A pressurized airstream was then used to remove tissue from the coral skeleton, and the coral tissue slurry underwent a series of shaking, centrifugation, and decanting processes to purify the algal pellet. The algal material was finally diluted in a seawater-based medium containing the chlorinating agent trichloroisocyanurate which acts as a bactericide. Cultures were grown in a 14/10-h light/dark cycle with low-light conditions and were then streaked onto seawater agar to isolate single colonies. C. velia was isolated and kept as it superficially resembles Symbiodinium. Two factors that were key to its discovery were that Moore had the curiosity and foresight to look further at this superficially uninteresting green-brown algal contaminant, and that C. velia is remarkably robust and survived well in culture and on plates. At the same time, Moore isolated a large spherical algal cell that was later formally described as Vitrella brassicaformis (see Sections 2.4 and 3.3).</p><p>To date, the only other recorded isolation of C. velia was from the coral Montipora digitata at Magnetic Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cumbo, 2005)</ref>. This study was also aiming to isolate cultures of Symbiodinium from the eggs and tissue of the coral when C. velia was found. The methods used were very similar to those of Moore, but also used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to separate algal cells based on size and emission. The similarity between the methods of <ref type="bibr">Moore and Cumbo,</ref> and the fact that these are fairly standard algal isolation methods, suggests that these processes that were designed to isolate Symbiodinium are also relevant for the isolation of C. velia. It is therefore surprising, given the vast amount of Symbiodinium research over the last few decades, that C. velia had not been reported before. It is interesting to note that so far all isolations of C. velia have been made from the tissues of stony coral species in Australian waters, implying the possibility of a relationship between the alga and the coral.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Phylogeny and etymology</head><p>Ultrastructural and genetic analyses placed C. velia in the superphylum Alveolata, which is a major line of protists including dinoflagellates, Apicomplexa, and ciliates. Genomic DNA of C. velia was extracted, and nuclear genes, including those encoding the large and small subunit rRNA, were sequenced <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Moore et al., 2008)</ref>. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that apicomplexan parasites and photosynthetic dinoflagellates were the closest known relatives to C. velia, with the highest homology found to apicomplexan organisms. The positioning of C. velia among the main alveolate groups can be seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.1. C. velia was significantly different to these known groups of organisms, so a new phylum, Chromerida, was created. The etymology of Chromera was influenced by observations of the chromophores (pigments) of the meront (division products) being inherited through cell division over many years <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Moore et al., 2008)</ref>. Velia <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.1 A representation of the relationship of C. velia to other alveolates. Based on nuclear phylogenetic data by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moore et al.

The unique nomenclature and phylogenetic positioning of C. velia reflect the novelty of this organism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Association with corals</head><p>Little is known about the interaction between C. velia and corals. C. velia has always been found associated with corals, but the fact that it is easily culturable in the laboratory indicates that it is not heavily reliant on any host organism. It is possible that C. velia has a symbiotic role with coral like its dinoflagellate relatives, or a parasitic role like its apicomplexan relatives. Alternatively, C. velia may just be a transient algal species that was at the right place at the right time when these coral studies were performed.</p><p>An endosymbiotic relationship similar to dinoflagellates, where C. velia lives inside a coral host, has been widely speculated. Dinoflagellates are known to live in symbiotic relationships with a diverse assortment of invertebrates and protists, with the best documented being the relationship between Symbiodinium and corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Murray &amp; Patterson, 2004)</ref>. This association benefits the host coral through carbon transfer from the alga, while the coral provides nutrients and a stable home for the algal cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Trench, 1987)</ref>. A recent study designed to test whether C. velia is endosymbiotic with coral was undertaken by Cumbo and colleagues using the scleractinian coral species Acropora digitifera and Acropora tenuis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cumbo et al., 2012)</ref>. Aposymbiotic coral larvae of A. digitifera and A. tenuis were exposed to three cultures of C. velia (that were from the original isolations made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cumbo in 2005)</ref>. Symbiodinium strain C1, originally isolated from A. tenuis, was used as a positive control. After 1, 2, or 3 days exposure to the algal cultures, the coral larvae were sampled and visualized under a fluorescence microscope to determine the density of cells within the larvae. Histological analysis was performed on A. digitifera samples at 2 and 5 days postinfection to further verify uptake of algae. Both species of coral larvae were found to acquire the C. velia cells and the Symbiodinium control. C. velia was present in the ectoderm (outer layer) and endoderm (inner layer) of the coral larvae for several days after infection, which is consistent with symbiotic dinoflagellates that are known to reside within the endoderm cells of corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lesser, Mazel, Gorbunov, &amp; Falkowski, 2004)</ref>. These results suggest that C. velia has the potential for endosymbiosis with coral larvae. However, further research is needed to confirm the nature of this relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Other chromerids</head><p>At the time of discovery of C. velia, another novel alga was found and was later formally described as V. brassicaformis <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Moore, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Oborník et al., 2012)</ref>. V. brassicaformis was found associated with the coral L. purpurea at One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. Similar metabolic features, photosynthetic ability, and molecular phylogeny have grouped the two in the phylum Chromerida. They do, however, vary significantly in morphology and molecular characters placing them in separate families, Chromeraceae for Chromera and Vitrellaceae for Vitrella.</p><p>The discovery of this second organism linking dinoflagellates and apicomplexans increases the scope of research possible to explore this relationship. It also helps to validate findings; any similarities seen between Chromera and Vitrella are likely to have arisen due to their common ancestry rather than just being a random adaptation. The discovery of further chromerids would greatly increase our understanding of the lineage and the relationship between these organisms and their ancestors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Biodiversity of chromerids</head><p>All chromerids have thus far been found associated with Australian coral reefs. As the ancestral form of apicomplexan parasites, it is highly unlikely that they would be so geographically confined. Janouškovec, Horák, Barott, Rohwer, and Keeling (2012) set out to explore the biodiversity of C. velia and related organisms as well as the relationship between the plastids of these species. Using phylogenetic analysis, they searched existing available prokaryotic sequence surveys for eukaryotic plastids. Numerous apicomplexan-related sequences were found, with nearly all of these originating from coral reef environments. A Chromera sequence was found associated with the surface of the coral Montastraea annularis from Curaçao, Netherland Antilles. Several Vitrella plastid sequences were found that had been mislabeled as originating from bacteria, and the original samples were associated with corals or coral reef sediment from studies in Netherland Antilles, Bahamas, Philippines, Hawaii, Virgin Islands, and Israel. Other sequence clusters were identified that are likely to be unknown relatives of Chromera and Vitrella. These sequences were derived from coralassociated macroalgae as well as coral tissue, suggesting that the organisms may not be obligate coral symbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Janouškovec, Horák, Barott, Rohwer, &amp; Keeling, 2013)</ref>. These findings have confirmed that Chromera and Vitrella are coral reef-associated organisms and provided insights into their global diversity. Further sampling of these regions should result in a variety of chromerid cultures that would support further research into this phylum.</p><p>3. LIFE CYCLE AND MORPHOLOGY 3.1. Overview C. velia has three life stages-a coccoid cell, a cyst, and a flagellate. Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to characterize the features present in these stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Moore et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Oborník et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Weatherby, Murray, Carter, &amp; Šlapeta, 2011)</ref>. The immotile coccoid cell is spherical to subspherical in shape and 5-7 mm in diameter, as seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.2. These cells use binary fission to produce two cells enclosed by a thin wall. Another round of division can lead to a cyst stage up to 9.5 mm in size that contains four daughter cells. The flagellates are slightly curved, eggplant-shaped cells approximately 5 mm Â 3 mm that possess a short anterior flagellum and a long posterior flagellum, as seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.3. The flagellate and coccoid forms are able to transform back and forth between the two states.</p><p>C. velia cells possess three ultrastructural characteristics distinctive to alveolates: (1) a micropore through the cell surface involved in pinocytosis;</p><p>(2) cortical alveoli, a layer of flattened vesicles with underlying microtubules that support the cell membrane; and (3) a large mitochondrion with ampulliform and tubular cristae (infoldings of the inner membrane) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Moore et al., 2008)</ref>. A distinguishing feature of C. velia is its large, golden-brown, cone-shaped plastid bound by four membranes. This organelle is of specific interest because it suggests that the plastid was originally acquired through secondary endosymbiosis. Another unusual feature of C. velia is the chromerosome, a unique organelle made of fibers that resembles an extrusome-like structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Oborník et al., 2011)</ref>. This structure is able to grow and extend into a rod-like projection that protrudes out of the cell. There are no similar features found in apicomplexans, and although morphologically diverse, the extrusomes of dinoflagellates are considerably different <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Leander &amp; Hoppenrath, 2008)</ref>. The purpose of such a structure is unknown but proposed to be involved in interacting with coral hosts or hunting algal prey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The flagellated state</head><p>The flagellated cells of C. velia were reported as only being seen "fleetingly" by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moore et al. (2008)</ref>, and this stage of the life cycle was not formally described until 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Oborník et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Weatherby et al., 2011)</ref>. Intensive SEM and TEM work was performed on highly flagellating cultures and revealed that the cell transforms by ejecting two preformed flagella from the coccoid cell. An ultrastructural feature unique to the C. velia flagellate is a small, finger-like projection at the base of the anterior flagellum ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.3) that may have photosensory implications. The flagellate also contains a pseudoconoid structure similar to protrusive rhoptries and micronemes in Apicomplexa that are used to establish infection. Beating of the posterior flagellum allows the cells to move at high speed in a zigzag pattern. The transformation between the coccoid and biflagellated cell has been observed to take only a few minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Oborník et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Among the related organisms in the Alveolata lineage, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans are known to possess motile life stages that vary widely in appearance. Colpodellids, which are heterotrophic predatory organisms, and perkinsids, which cause disease in shellfish, both have life cycles that include a zoospore form <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Blackbourn, Bower, &amp; Meyer, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Leander, Kuvardina, Aleshin, Mylnikov, &amp; Keeling, 2003)</ref>. The flagellated form of C. velia is similar to dinoflagellates, colpodellids, and perkinsids in appearance. All of these organisms have a motile form with the basic structure of two dissimilar flagella attached to an ovoid cell. The C. velia flagellate is particularly similar to colpodellids and perkinsids. The zoospores of perkinsids are the infective form of a parasite that lives within host tissues, such as oysters. Colpodellid flagellates are predatory forms that attach to and engulf other protists <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brugerolle, 2002)</ref>. These similarities with related species suggest that C. velia may also use the flagellate form to infect hosts, and it may possess predatory abilities when a suitable nutrient source is not available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Comparison to Vitrella</head><p>The life cycle of V. brassicaformis is more complicated than that of C. velia, involving photosynthetic and predatory stages. Similarities between the coccoid cells of both species include the plastid, cortical alveoli, microtubules below the membrane, and mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Oborník et al., 2012)</ref>. The most distinct difference is a large sporangium stage, 40 mm in diameter and containing dozens of zoospores. These zoospores are similar in size and shape to the C. velia flagellate. The flagellates of both species have a short flagellum and a long flagellum protruding from the ventral side of the cell that enables motility. The flagellate of V. brassicaformis differs from C. velia morphologically by not possessing the characteristic pseudoconoid, chromerosome, or finger-like projection on the anterior flagellum. Despite this morphological diversity, the similarity in features supports the close relationship between these chromerids that was evident by genetic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Janouškovec et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Environmental stimuli and motility</head><p>The behavior of C. velia when exposed to different environmental stimuli could be used to better understand the life cycle and help identify its ecological niche. Motility is an important ability used by marine microorganisms to take advantage of favorable environments, leave unfavorable environments, or seek a suitable mate for sexual reproduction. Light is a significant factor in the coral reef environment, particularly, for photosynthetic organisms that rely on the sun to gain energy. Light-induced movement has been observed in a wide array of algal organisms and is thought to aid selection of a suitable habitat <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Yakobovitch, Benayahu, &amp; Weis, 2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Oborník et al. (2011)</ref> grew C. velia in a 12/12-h light/dark regime similar to that of its natural habitat, where it was observed to have a temporal cycle of motility over 24 h. The cells became motile 2 h after illumination, peaking after 4 h and reverting to an immotile state again after 7 h. Transformation between states was quick, and the flagellated state was observed to last up to 3 h before changing back to the coccoid state. Illumination was found to have a considerable effect on the percentage of motile cells, with a change in illumination from 3.15 to 35.8 W m À2 causing a 10-fold increase. When grown under low-light conditions for 2 weeks, flagellation peaked at day 11, while under high light, it peaked at day 5. The related dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium, exhibits similar motility rhythms in a light-dark environmental cycle. Symbiodinium cells are motile only during the day, and isolates from different hosts have characteristic times for becoming motile <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sweeney, 1984)</ref>. Symbiodinium cells are held in the immotile form by host factors when in an endosymbiotic relationship, while the motile form is thought to be involved in establishing symbiosis and also sexual reproduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Trench, 1993)</ref>. It is proposed that the coccoid form of C. velia behaves in a similar way to Symbiodinium by inhabiting corals. A sexual stage has not yet been seen in C. velia, although further research is needed to rule out the possibility. In the absence of a sexual stage, the flagellate is thought to spread to other parts of the reef in search of nutrients, a new host or an escape from high-light exposure.</p><p>Nutrient and salinity levels may also significantly affect the motileimmotile transformation of C. velia. The act of swimming allows marine microorganisms to take advantage of nutrient conditions that vary throughout the vertical water column <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(McKay, Kamykowski, Milligan, Schaeffer, &amp; Sinclair, 2006)</ref>. Nutrient levels in the environment affect the life cycle of Symbiodinium, with low nutrient levels inducing the motile stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ellegaard, Kulis, &amp; Anderson, 1998)</ref>. To test for similar behavior in C. velia, Guo, Weatherby, Carter, and Šlapeta (2010) monitored the percentage of motile cells when grown in a range of nutrient and salt concentrations. They found flagellation to be suppressed at high nutrient and salinity levels compared to lower levels. A complete lack of salt or nutrients resulted in no flagellation, but optimal flagellation was seen with relatively low salt and nutrients. These results suggest a low-salinity and relatively lownutrient environment promotes flagellation during the diurnal cycle. The authors speculated that these suboptimal conditions might be a cause of stress that induces flagellation so that the cell can move to a more suitable environment or host. Several zooplanktonic organisms use diurnal vertical migration to adjust position in their habitat to optimize photosynthesis and escape predation, and it is feasible that C. velia uses its motility in a similar way <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Nultsch &amp; Hader, 1979)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">The plastid of C. velia and its importance</head><p>The photosynthetic plastid of C. velia is related to both the chloroplast of photosynthetic dinoflagellates and the relict chloroplast or "apicoplast" found in Apicomplexa. Phylogenetic analyses of the plastid SSU rDNA and photosynthetic PsbA gene, as well as the complete plastid genome, confirmed that apicomplexans and dinoflagellates share a common ancestral chloroplast lineage <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Janouškovec et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moore et al., 2008)</ref>. It is thought that this common ancestor contained a chromalveolate plastid possessing chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fast, Kissinger, Roos, &amp; Keeling, 2001)</ref>. Peridinin dinoflagellates kept their plastid, while degeneration of the chromalveolate plastid occurred in other dinoflagellates and apicomplexans <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Keeling, 2004)</ref>. Some dinoflagellates were able to replace the chromalveolate plastid with an ingested photosynthetic plastid, while other dinoflagellates lost their plastid and without the ability to photosynthesize turned to heterotrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cavalier-Smith, 1999)</ref>. Parasitic apicomplexans retain their plastid as an apicoplast that no longer has the ability to photosynthesize.</p><p>The discovery of the apicoplast provoked much debate over whether the plastid had red or green algal origins. One side argued that the plastid came from the same red algal endosymbiont as that of dinoflagellates, while the other suggested that the plastid arose due to a separate event involving a green alga <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Keeling, 2009)</ref>. The discovery of Chromera and Vitrella enabled this controversy to be resolved. The chromerid plastids have features of both the apicomplexan and dinoflagellate plastids, suggesting a common lineage <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Moore et al., 2008)</ref>. The plastid genomes of C. velia and V. brassicaformis further validated that the organelle arose due to endosymbiosis of a red alga <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Janouškovec et al., 2010)</ref>. This clarification has enabled a better understanding of the evolution of Apicomplexa, as well as the relationship between endosymbiosis and photosynthesis.</p><p>A direct link between the plastid of C. velia and the apicoplast lineage is seen in the photosynthetic PsbA gene of the plastid genome. C. velia differs from all other eukaryotic algae by using the codon UGA rather than UGG to encode the amino acid tryptophan in the PsbA gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Moore et al., 2008)</ref>. The use of UGA to encode tryptophan has only been found in the apicoplasts of coccidians and in the mitochondria of various organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ralph et al., 2004)</ref>. It has never before been seen in the plastid of a photosynthetic organism. This finding highlights the unique position of C. velia and gives reason to believe that C. velia and its plastid have many more commonalities with apicomplexans and their apicoplast.</p><p>The apicoplast is present in most apicomplexans, including Plasmodium, and is essential for cell survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(McFadden &amp; Waller, 1997)</ref>. This is likely due to the biochemical pathways contained in the apicoplast, including segments of heme biosynthesis, assembly of iron sulfur complexes, and parts of fatty acid and isopentenyl diphosphatase synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jomaa et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ralph et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Seeber, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Waller et al., 1998)</ref>. It has been suggested that the plastid products are also involved in host-cell invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ralph et al., 2004)</ref>. The small size of the apicoplast and the difficulties involved in working with pathogens have limited the research into the exact functions of the organelle <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Okamoto &amp; McFadden, 2008)</ref>. Recent studies have suggested that the production of isoprenoid precursors is the only essential apicoplast function during infection of malaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Yeh &amp; DeRisi, 2011)</ref>. C. velia presents a unique opportunity to study an apicoplast-related plastid and to clarify what functions the apicoplast has in parasite health and infection. The phylogeny of the plastid in C. velia suggests that at least some of the plastid biochemical pathways will be conserved with the apicoplast. C. velia can easily be cultured in the laboratory to high densities, allowing the plastid to be isolated and its structure and biochemistry studied. The ancestral nature of the C. velia plastid permits new research into the evolution of dinoflagellate and apicomplexan plastids.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Light-harvesting complexes</head><p>Light-harvesting complexes (LHC) are important for photosynthetic efficiency, photoprotection, and photoacclimation. These protein structures surround photosystem reaction centers, which are embedded in the thylakoid membranes within plastids. LHC contain pigments that absorb light for photosynthesis, transferring it to photosystem reaction centers that turn solar energy into chemical energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Green, 2003)</ref>. This reaction also produces organic carbon in the form of glucose. Three major types of pigments occur in photosynthetic algae: chlorophyll, carotenoids, and phycobilins <ref type="bibr">(Rabinowitch &amp; Govindjee, 1969)</ref>. As well as having light-harvesting functions, the carotenoids are able to protect against damaging photochemical reactions. Each pigment has a unique absorption spectrum, allowing it to absorb certain wavelengths of light. Red algae contain phycobilin pigments that absorb red and green light and allow the algae to live in deeper water or turbid regions where longer wavelengths are filtered out, and there is only dim blue-green light <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cole &amp; Sheath, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rabinowitch &amp; Govindjee, 1969)</ref>. Photosynthetic Symbiodinium contains chlorophyll c and chlorophyll a as well as the carotenoids peridinin, dinoxanthin, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin, and b-carotene <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hennige, Suggett, Warner, McDougall, &amp; Smith, 2009)</ref>. Pigment composition has been used for many years as a criterion to taxonomically identify algae, with dinoflagellates being grouped according to chloroplast pigment patterns as well as morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Indelicato &amp; Watson, 1986)</ref>.</p><p>C. velia differs from all known photosynthetic alveolates in possessing chlorophyll a, but no chlorophyll c. The plastid contains the carotenoids violaxanthin, an unknown isofucoxanthin-like pigment, and b-carotene, which represent rather simple pigmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Moore et al., 2008)</ref>. Vitrella and Chromera have similar photosynthetic pigment profiles and both lack chlorophyll c. The only difference is that V. brassicaformis incorporates the carotenoid vaucheriaxanthin rather than the isofucoxanthin-like pigment found in C. velia <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Oborník et al., 2012)</ref>. These similarities suggest that the two families share a common ancestral plastid that has not undergone excessive change over time.</p><p>As the C. velia plastid is known to be related to red algal chloroplasts, there is interest in exploring whether the LHC genes present in these plastids share a similar evolutionary pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Pan, Šlapeta, Carter, and Chen (2012)</ref> used this idea to look at LHC genes from expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences of C. velia. Twenty-three candidate LHC genes were identified from an EST database of C. velia, and these were compared with sequenced LHC genes from other photosynthetic organisms by phylogenetic analysis. C. velia was found to have multiple copies of LHC homologs, and four different LHC groups were identified. Most of the LHC sequences clustered in a distinct group that was separate from all other known algal LHCs, but still closely related to dinoflagellates, diatoms, and brown algae. A group of three sequences were related to red alga-like LHC. This is interesting given that the light-harvesting strategies of red algae and C. velia vary significantly, and the presence of similar sequences is likely a relic from the evolution of C. velia from a red algal ancestor. Two sequences were found to be LHC groups of the yellow-green alga Vaucheria litorea. A single homolog grouped with the LI818/LI818-like protein sequences and its close similarity suggests that it encodes an LI818 protein. LI818 proteins occur in a range of photosynthetic organisms and have photoprotective roles under stress conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Zhu &amp; Green, 2010)</ref>. Overall, the presence of different LHC groups in C. velia and their divergent proposed functions suggest that C. velia may not be as closely related to the red algal lineage as had previously been thought. The variation seen in the LHC of C. velia, diatoms, and red alga reflects the differences in light-harvesting strategies employed by these organisms that have adapted to survive in particular ecological niches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Photoprotection</head><p>Light is the most important factor for photosynthetic organisms; however, light can also be damaging. Too much light can lead to an increase in reactive oxygen species produced as a by-product of photosynthesis and these can damage photosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Muller, Li, &amp; Niyogi, 2001</ref>). For shallow water corals, such as those from which C. velia was isolated, high light at mid-day is a daily stressor for the resident algae <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hennige, McGinley, Grottoli, &amp; Warner, 2011)</ref>. Biochemical and developmental responses to light have evolved in algae to optimize photosynthesis and growth. Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) is a mechanism that protects photosynthetic organisms from excess irradiation. This process involves the conversion of the carotenoid violaxanthin to zeaxanthin, with excess energy being dissipated through heat <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Muller et al., 2001)</ref>. Symbiotic dinoflagellates are known to utilize NPQ as a strategy to deal with high-light levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hoegh-Guldberg &amp; Jones, 1999)</ref>. Photoinhibition (light-associated damage to photosystems) is a daily challenge faced by these organisms, so it is evident that symbionts with greater NPQ ability should be more resistant to thermally related bleaching.</p><p>Given the high-light environment in which C. velia lives, it would be reasonable to assume that it has photoprotective mechanisms. The outlying LHC of C. velia that was identified to be homologous with LI818 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Pan et al., 2012)</ref> indicates that it produces at least one photoprotective protein. LI818 proteins found in diatoms and green algae are known to utilize NPQ in times of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Peers et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zhu &amp; Green, 2010)</ref>. The presence of this mechanism in related species, and the fact that C. velia contains the carotenoid violaxanthin that is able to play a role in NPQ, prompted <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kotabová, Kaňa, Jarešová, and Prášil (2011)</ref> to test for the pathway in C. velia. C. velia was compared to Nannochlorosis limnetica, a photosynthetic alga that also lacks chlorophyll c. Both organisms were grown in continuous illumination of 80 mmol quanta m -2 s -1 , and growth, chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics, pigments, and absorption spectra were measured. The cultures were exposed to a strong orange actinic light to test for NPQ. C. velia was found to dissipate excess irradiation by very efficient NPQ, whereas N. limnetica had only limited NPQ, such that the excessive irradiation caused photoinhibition and damage of photosystem reaction centers.</p><p>Both C. velia and N. limnetica contain violaxanthin as their major carotenoid, which is converted to zeaxanthin in the NPQ process. It is known that in eustigmatophytes, such as N. limnetica, violaxanthin has a primarily light-harvesting role. Activity of the photoprotective violaxanthin cycle in these algae is restricted to extended high irradiances or temperature stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Figueroa et al., 1997)</ref>. The light-induced deepoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin is unusually fast in C. velia, comparable only to diatoms that have a simplified one-step reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Goss &amp; Jakob, 2010)</ref>. Vascular plants and brown algae show much slower rates of reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Garcia-Mendoza &amp; Colombo-Pallora, 2007)</ref>. This efficiency in C. velia is likely due to the fact that violaxanthin is one of the major pigments, and its abundance allows for a faster reaction. Beyond its role in NPQ, violaxanthin was also found to have an important contribution to light harvesting, which is also seen in N. limnetica. Violaxanthin is therefore not only an active photosynthetic pigment in C. velia but also plays an important role as an effective photoprotective mechanism. In comparison, the violaxanthin of N. limnetica plays an important role in light harvesting but does not show significant deepoxidation or NPQ. This photoprotective quality may widen the scope of C. velia, allowing it to live in areas with particularly high-light levels. The reefs where C. velia has been found can be exposed to direct sunlight during the tidal change, and during this time, photoprotective properties would be necessary. These findings also have implications for Chromera as a symbiont, since they suggest it has adapted to high-light environments and does not need to rely on the protection of a coral host.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Photoacclimation</head><p>Environmental factors affecting the photosynthetic performance of symbiotic dinoflagellates include nutrient availability, temperature, and CO 2 level, but it is the ambient light (both quantity and quality) that has the most effect on the productivity, physiology, and ecology of corals and their symbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Quigg et al., 2012)</ref>. Photoacclimation is a physiological response to changes in the light environment such as light intensity and spectral quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Falkowski &amp; LaRoche, 1991)</ref>. In photosynthetic organisms, photoacclimation results from alterations to the components of the photosynthetic apparatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(MacIntyre, Kana, Anning, &amp; Geider, 2002)</ref>. To some extent, all algae are capable of photoacclimation, and strategies include changing the number of photosynthetic units or shifting the ratio of pigments to photosynthesis reaction centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Falkowski &amp; LaRoche, 1991)</ref>. Increasing the number of pigments and reaction centers can take advantage of extra irradiation, while different pigments are able to use different wavelengths of available light. The connection between the LHC and photosystem reaction centers is also important for the efficient transfer of energy. Maximum photosynthesis and production in algae is hence dependent on the efficiency of these photosynthetic mechanisms to successfully capture and utilize light energy.</p><p>Living in coastal marine areas with fluctuating light levels makes the possession of an effective photoacclimation strategy extremely beneficial. Symbiodinium species are known to alter the number and ratio of photosynthetic pigments to adjust their capacity for light harvesting <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hennige et al., 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Quigg et al. (2012)</ref> set out to investigate the efficiency of photosynthesis and the ability for photoacclimation in C. velia. Cultures of C. velia were grown in conditions of continuous low light (15 mmol photons m -2 s -1 ) and continuous high light (200 mmol photons m -2 s -1 ). Cells were also grown in a sinusoidal light:dark regime with a 12:12-h light:dark cycle that better simulates the conditions in nature. The light intensity was controlled by computer with the highest light level of 500 mmol photons m -2 s -1 at mid-day. Growth rates showed that cells in low light grew faster than those at high light, but it was the sinusoidal light conditions that had the highest growth rate, which was more than double that of the high-light cultures. These results reflect the adaptation of C. velia to its natural environment where light undergoes a daily cycle of irradiance.</p><p>High photosynthetic rates were maintained when C. velia was grown in continuous light-limited conditions or continuous high-light conditions. An acclimation to low-light conditions is expressed as a reorganization of LHC and increase in chlorophyll content, as well as an increased connectivity between LHC and photosystem reaction centers allowing more effective energy transfer. In contrast, high-light conditions resulted in a decrease in chlorophyll, but an increased carotenoid:chlorophyll a ratio. There was a high increase in the carotenoid violaxanthin, which would be connected to its photoprotective qualities. The diel periodicity of irradiation was found to be crucial in attaining maximal photosynthetic rates, with maximum photosynthetic activity observed at mid-morning. These results suggest that C. velia is a highly efficient photosynthetic organism and is able to acclimate to a wide range of irradiances.</p><p>C. velia was also found to use photorespiration as a component of its photoacclimation strategy. This common process in phototrophs involves the fixation of O 2 and the release of fixed carbon compounds such as glycolate <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Quigg et al., 2012)</ref>. Photorespiration can help dissipate excess energy at high irradiance levels by providing an alternate electron pathway to those that cause photooxidative damage. Photorespiration has also been reported in Symbiodinium, with the carbon compounds released being used by the coral host <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Crawley, Kline, Dunn, Anthony, &amp; Dove, 2010)</ref>. The carbon fixed in Symbiodinium can be used for respiration, maintenance, or growth of the alga, while more than 90% of it is translocated to the coral. The animal uses the carbon for respiration, growth, and formation of carbonate in the coral skeleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Falkowski, Dubinsky, Muscatine, &amp; Porter, 1984)</ref>. The high carbon-fixation rates observed for C. velia may mean that it can also supply carbon to coral or other organisms. The similarity between C. velia and Symbiodinium has implications for the relationship between C. velia and coral, suggesting that coral would benefit from having C. velia as a symbiont.</p><p>In summary, despite a rather simple pigment and photosynthetic system, C. velia has surprisingly effective photosynthesis. The ability to undergo photorespiration and NPQ allows it to avoid damage by photoinhibition. These qualities may allow C. velia to acclimate to a wide range of irradiances, giving it an advantage over photosynthetic competitors that are less tolerant to solar-induced bleaching. These properties are similar to those of some dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hennige et al., 2009)</ref>, reflecting the close relationship between these algae and their evolutionary adaptations to a similar type of environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">BIOSYNTHESIS AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF C. VELIA TO APICOMPLEXANS</head><p>With its evolutionary position between dinoflagellates and apicomplexans, it is reasonable to assume that C. velia would possess biochemical pathways similar to both groups. With the importance of the apicoplast for parasite survival, it is a potential drug target for the myriad of lethal diseases caused by apicomplexans. C. velia provides the perfect platform for increasing our understanding of the apicoplast and biochemical pathways in apicomplexans in the hope of identifying suitable therapeutic methods. A safe and fairly inexpensive method of exploring biochemical pathways is through the use of genetic data. The nuclear genome of C. velia has not yet been fully sequenced; however, 454-pyrosequencing data have been compiled by <ref type="bibr">Woehle et al. (2011), and Šlapeta, J and Carter, D (unpublished)</ref>. The resulting genome databases are incomplete but have proved useful in finding homologous genes and pathways between C. velia and related organisms. These genetic data have enabled a better understanding of the relationship between C. velia and apicomplexans through the study of multiple biochemical pathways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Tetrapyrrole synthesis</head><p>Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is one of the fundamental pathways in living organisms. It allows the formation of heme, important for oxidative and energy metabolism, and also chlorophyll synthesis in photoautotrophs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kořený, Sobotka, Janouškovec, Keeling, &amp; Oborník, 2011)</ref>. The importance of this pathway has resulted in it being highly conserved between all three domains of life. Only the first step of the pathway, the synthesis of d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), shows variation. Heterotrophic eukaryotes synthesize ALA in mitochondria from glycine and succinyl-CoA using a C4 pathway, and subsequent steps of the pathway take place in the cytosol and then back in the mitochondrion. In comparison, photosynthetic eukaryotes use glutamate and a C5 pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Panek &amp; O'Brien, 2002)</ref>. This pathway takes place in the plastid of photosynthetic organisms, reflecting the need for the tetrapyrroles, heme and chlorophyll, in photosynthetic functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Papenbrock, Mock, Kruse, &amp; Grimm, 1999)</ref>. In Apicomplexa, heme synthesis follows a pathway that is a combination of those seen in heterotrophic and phototrophic eukaryotes. ALA is initially produced in the mitochondrion by the C4 pathway before it is exported to the apicoplast for the next three or four steps, with the remaining steps occurring in the cytosol and mitochondrion <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kořený et al., 2011)</ref>. This unusual pathway in apicomplexans may reflect the evolution of the lineage from phototroph to heterotroph.</p><p>Analysis of the C. velia tetrapyrrole pathway may help increase our understanding of the unusual apicomplexan pathway. In a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kořený et al. (2011)</ref>, heme biosynthesis genes were screened for in the C. velia 454-pyrosequencing genome database. The authors also radiolabeled glycine and glutamate for incorporation into the chlorophyll of C. velia and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. Radiolabeling showed that C. velia synthesizes chlorophyll from glycine and succinyl-CoA via the C4 pathway, while Synechocystis uses glutamate and the C5 pathway. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the C. velia tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway is made up of a mosaic of genes from different origins. These genes have the same origins as those found in the heme biosynthesis pathway of apicomplexans, indicating that they are ancestral genes. The C. velia pathway also incorporates four extra proteins that share an evolutionary history with photosynthetic eukaryotes. In C. velia, ALA is produced in the mitochondria before moving to the plastid for the rest of the pathway, reflecting the close relationship of the enzymes with those found in photosynthetic eukaryotes. The unique tetrapyrrole synthesis pathway of C. velia represents an evolutionary intermediate between the pathways of photosynthetic eukaryotes and apicomplexan parasites. When apicomplexans lost the ability to photosynthesize, they no longer needed tetrapyrrole products in the plastid. These results suggest that the enzyme isoforms were reduced to a single copy, and the last steps of the pathway were moved from the plastid to the cytosol and mitochondria. The tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway is a perfect example to demonstrate how C. velia has the ability to shed light on the functions and evolution of apicomplexans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Galactolipid synthesis</head><p>Galactolipids are the major class of lipids present in the membranes of plastids and are essential for the synthesis of a functional photosynthetic apparatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kobayashi, Kondo, Fukuda, Nishimura, &amp; Ohta, 2007)</ref>. These lipids make up 85% of the total lipid content of plant and algal cells, where they are involved in critical functions involving the synthesis and homeostasis of membranes, as well as developmental and physiological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Botté et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jouhet, Marechal, &amp; Block, 2007)</ref>. In plants and algae, the two main galactolipids, monogalactosyldiacyglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacyglycerol (DGDG), are synthesized by galactosyltransferases in the plastid envelope. There have been suggestions of the presence of galactolipid biosynthesis connected to the apicoplast of apicomplexan parasites; however, how these lipids are synthesized and their effect in parasitism are unknown.</p><p>As a relative of apicomplexans with a functional plastid, C. velia represents an ideal model for understanding how galactolipids may be synthesized and used in parasites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Botté et al. (2011)</ref> explored this idea by extracting the lipids from C. velia and mining the C. velia 454-pyrosequencing genomic DNA database for lipid synthesis genes. C. velia was found to contain the plant-like MGDG and DGDG, with DGDG localized to the plastid membranes. There is also evidence for a plant-like galactolipid biosynthesis pathway. Plant-like MGDG and DGDG synthase enzymes were found to be encoded in the nuclear genome. These plant-like enzymes are responsible for the incorporation of galactose from UDP-galactose into MGDG and DGDG found in C. velia, which resembles the process in plant chloroplasts. Similar galactolipids have been found in dinoflagellates, providing further evidence for the common red algal origins of their plastids <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Leblond &amp; Chapman, 2000)</ref>. The lack of apicomplexan homologs to the galactolipid synthesis genes found in C. velia implies that Apicomplexa obtain galactolipids by alternate means, such as scavenging them from their hosts. With the loss of photosynthesis, the requirement for galactolipids by the apicomplexans would have decreased, so it is reasonable to assume that the biosynthesis pathway was also lost. Galactolipid synthesis is not present in animals so would make an ideal drug target. Further research is needed to verify whether this pathway is still required in apicomplexans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Sterol synthesis</head><p>Sterols are ringed lipids that play a role in the membrane integrity of eukaryotes. Apicomplexa lack the ability to synthesize sterols so must obtain them from other organisms, most commonly their host. Phototrophs such as dinoflagellates possess genes to synthesize sterols inside the cell. Sterol composition is closely connected to phylogenetic organization, allowing chemotaxonomic relationships to be determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Leblond et al., 2010)</ref>. Sterols are also useful as biomarkers, with unique predominant sterols acting as a type of lipid fingerprint to identify organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mooney et al., 2007)</ref>. Understanding sterol synthesis in C. velia may provide an insight into the sterol biosynthesis in apicomplexans before this ability was lost.</p><p>C. velia is an autotrophic organism that does not rely on other organisms to provide it with sterols. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Leblond, Dodson, Khadka, Holder, and Seipelt (2012)</ref> were interested in finding genes for sterol synthesis in C. velia to determine the synthesis pathway as well as comparing these sterols to dinoflagellates in the hope of finding chemotaxonomic relationships or lipid biomarkers. C. velia was cultured and the lipids analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Five sterols were found to be produced by C. velia, and analyses showed that none were homologous with dinoflagellates, so these organisms cannot be linked chemotaxically. The sterols that were found have only been observed in unrelated algal and plant species, suggesting that the sterol biosynthesis pathway of C. velia is ancestral to several algal groups. Of the sterols found in C. velia, three were already identified and two were unknown. The three identified are common in other organisms and the unknowns are only found in small quantities, meaning that the sterols would not be useful biomarkers for C. velia. Examination of the C. velia EST database uncovered three putative sterol biosynthesis genes, and interestingly, these genes were found to be loose homologs with apicomplexan genes. This indicates an antiquated pathway in Apicomplexa that is no longer functional and has degenerated over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Iron-uptake mechanisms</head><p>The marine environment contains relatively low iron levels with intense competition for this limited resource that is essential for growth. Common strategies for iron uptake from the environment are the excretion of siderophores that scavenge Fe 3þ iron (nonreductive uptake) and the reduction of ferric complexes at the cell surface (reductive uptake) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sutak, Šlapeta, San Roman, Camadro, &amp; Lesuisse, 2010)</ref>. During reductive uptake, reductase proteins in the plasma membrane change Fe 3þ to Fe 2þ which is then channeled through the plasma membrane into the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Kosman, 2003)</ref>. Most of the information about these iron accumulation mechanisms has been derived from studying the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which provides an ideal model organism that is well studied and easy to grow. In comparison, very little is known of the iron-uptake strategies of marine phytoplankton.</p><p>C. velia has a high iron requirement for respiration and photosynthesis. This fact motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sutak et al. (2010)</ref> to investigate the iron-uptake mechanisms in C. velia in comparison with the well-characterized S. cerevisiae. Both species were grown in low-and high-iron media, and iron uptake and reductase assays performed. C. velia was found to contain a novel iron-uptake mechanism, with a large number of iron-binding sites in the cell wall to allow iron to concentrate near transport sites. After concentration in the cell wall, these aqueous Fe 3þ ions are taken up by the cells without prior reduction. This process and how it works have not yet been fully characterized, but it does not involve the use of siderophores or reduction of naturally occurring ferric complexes. This unique strategy may also be found in related lineages such as dinoflagellates or apicomplexans; however, at this stage, very little is known about the iron uptake in these organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sutak, Lesuisse, Tachezy, &amp; Richardson, 2008)</ref>. The high iron requirements for parasitic apicomplexans would suggest that an efficient iron-uptake mechanism would be useful. Better understanding of such a mechanism could lead to novel chemotherapeutic methods for treating the diseases caused by these parasites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Since its discovery in the coral reefs of Australia, there has been a lot of interest in C. velia. This ordinary looking brown alga has the unique evolutionary position of connecting dinoflagellates to apicomplexans, enabling it to shed light on the shift from autotrophy to parasitism. The possibility of endosymbiosis with corals, along with its highly efficient and photoprotective photosynthetic system, demonstrates similarities and differences with the dinoflagellates that may be indicative of evolution toward parasitism. The biology and life cycle of C. velia and its fellow chromerid, V. brassicaformis, have many similarities to both dinoflagellates and apicomplexans, but it is the plastid that has gained the most attention. Its close relationship to the apicomplexan apicoplast may give C. velia an integral role in finding new drug targets for the parasites that affect millions of people each year. A prime example of this can be seen in the novel iron-uptake mechanism in C. velia: the ability to block the iron-uptake receptors in apicomplexans would lead to parasite death and would be a very useful therapeutic tool. Further research on the biological functions of C. velia in comparison with dinoflagellates and apicomplexans will help us to understand these organisms and, ultimately, may help find a way to defeat the parasites.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4 . 2</head><label>42</label><figDesc>Scanning electron micrograph of C. velia coccoid cells.

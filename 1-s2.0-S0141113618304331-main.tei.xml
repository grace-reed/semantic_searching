			<abstract>
				<p>High latitude seas will be among the first marine systems to be impacted by ocean acidification (OA). Previous research studying the effects of OA on the pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica, has led this species to be identified as a sentinel organism for OA in polar oceans. Here, we present gene expression data on L. h. antarctica, collected in situ during the seasonal transition from early spring to early summer. Our findings suggest that after over-wintering under seasonal sea ice, pteropods progress toward full maturity in the early summer when food becomes increasingly available. This progression is highlighted by a dramatic shift in gene expression that supports the development of cytoskeletal structures, membrane ion transportation, and metabolically important enzymes associated with glycolysis. In addition, we observed signs of defense of genomic integrity and maturation as evidenced by an up-regulation of genes involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, and gametogenesis. These data contribute to a broader understanding of the life-cycle dynamics for L. h. antarctica and provide key insights into the transcriptomic signals of pteropod maturation and growth during this key seasonal transition.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>High latitude seas are predicted to experience ocean acidification (OA) at an accelerated rate due to the relative high solubility of CO in cold waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Breitburg et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Steinacher et al., 2009)</ref>. The Southern Ocean is projected to follow the Arctic Ocean in timing as the second major ocean to experience rapid declines of carbonate mineral saturation states, particularly the more soluble calcium carbonate polymorph -aragonite <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fabry et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hauri et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kapsenberg et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McNeil and Matear, 2008)</ref>. This change in ocean chemistry will have wide ranging impacts on calcifying marine organisms, and barring mechanisms of rapid adaptation or physiological plasticity, such global abiotic changes will likely impact the integrity of marine food webs. Thus, a major research challenge in polar marine ecosystems is to study the response of key species to these projected ocean changes.</p><p>In addition to basic research, the marine research community has been exploring ways to monitor the biological impacts of OA. Here, shelled pteropods have been proposed as sentinel organisms for detecting the progression of OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Manno et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Maas et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Moya et al., 2016)</ref>. In the Southern Ocean, the pteropod Limacina helicina antarctica has emerged as the focal sentinel species because it produces a highly soluble aragonite-based shell and is distributed across all sectors of the Southern Ocean. Unfortunately, due to its location in remote high latitude seas, a life history that involves long periods under fast sea ice, and its relatively small size, it remains a challenge to observe these organisms in situ. The focus of this study was to use comparative transcriptomics as a means to further our understanding of a sentinel species. Here, signatures of gene expression provide insight into the physiological status of L. h. antarctica collected below the seasonal sea ice.</p><p>In the Southern Ocean, L. h. antarctica is an ecologically significant member of the macrozooplankton, contributing to energy transfer and biogeochemical cycling of carbon in Antarctic waters. Ecologically, L. h. antarctica plays a major role in food web dynamics and energy transfer, both as prey and as a primary consumer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hunt et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lancraft et al., 1991)</ref>. Here, L. h. antarctica is prey for a variety of organisms including carnivorous zooplankton and fish <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hunt et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lancraft et al., 1991)</ref>, which in turn support higher trophic levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Davis et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">McClintock et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Seibel and Dierssen, 2003)</ref>. As a primary https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.10.006 Received 7 June 2018; Received in revised form 11 October 2018; Accepted 12 October 2018 consumer, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Elliott et al. (2009)</ref> estimated that L. h. antarctica could remove up to 550 mg C m −3 of the haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica per day during the summer when P. antarctica blooms. In terms of biogeochemical cycling, L. h. antarctica produces organic carbon in the form of fecal pellets and discarded mucous nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Accornero et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Manno et al., 2009)</ref>, and inorganic carbon in the form of calcium carbonate shells that sink to deeper waters following pteropod mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Honjo, 2004)</ref>. In some parts of the Southern Ocean, pteropod shells are a significant contribution of carbon in the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Collier et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gardner et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Given the broad ecological importance of L. h. antarctica, surprisingly little is known about the ecology of this species. In this study, we had the opportunity to collect young adult pteropods in the southern Ross Sea, a region of the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean, at a time when the pteropods were exiting an over-wintering period and entering the transition to austral summer. To capture aspects of developmental physiology in situ, we evaluated changes in the transcriptome of young adult L. h. antarctica that were collected during early spring (early September) and early summer (late November/early December) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Seasonal transitions at high latitudes are marked by conspicuous seasonal day/night cycles, in which there is 24 h of darkness during the winter and 24 h of sunlight during the summer, separated by brief transition periods during the spring and autumn. This day/night seasonality drives primary productivity in the region, with phytoplankton growth occurring in summer months <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Smith et al., 2000)</ref>. This phenology of productivity in turn dominates the timing, rate, and quantity of energy flow throughout the Antarctic food web. Photosynthesis processes that are suppressed during the winter and dramatically increase during the summer months are a major driver of pH seasonality in the Ross Sea region <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kapsenberg et al., 2015)</ref>. Therefore, environmental changes including light, food availability, and seawater carbonate chemistry, are all factors than impact L. h. antarctica during this seasonal transition.</p><p>In terms of life history as it relates to seasonal changes, relatively little is known about this species. L. h. antarctica is a protanderous hermaphroditic species primarily believed to have an annual life cycle with young adults overwintering before developing into mature males, transitioning to females, and spawning during the late summer or early autumn <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hunt et al., 2008)</ref>. Although there is evidence that this species can live up to three years or more, individuals greater than a year of age are thought to make up a relatively small portion of Antarctic pteropod populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bednaršek et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wang et al., 2017)</ref>. In summer field campaigns, we have routinely collected pteropods in high numbers during plankton tows with all animals being of about the same size, suggesting these pteropods are all a single cohort of one age class .</p><p>Given the limited understanding L. h. antarctica phenology, we felt that the use of gene expression analysis might sheds some light onto the physiological and developmental changes of this species as it transitions from young to mature adult. Other studies have used comparative transcriptomics to stage the timing of reproduction in macrozooplankton <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Roncalli et al., 2018)</ref>. In our study, analysis of differential gene expression would contribute to the effort to use L. h. antarctica as a sentinel species in the Southern Ocean. Thus, to assess seasonal transcriptomes in L. h. antarctica, we performed RNA-sequencing on pteropods collected in September during early austral spring (i.e., the onset of the transition from 24-h darkness to 24-h daylight), and in November to December, during early summer (i.e., after the transition, during 24-h daylight). As such, these pteropods likely represent post-overwintering young adults possibly developing into mature adult males. For this sequencing effort, we used comparative transcriptomics to identify season-specific changes in the transcriptome and explored gene expression networks that correlate transcriptome-wide expression profiles to season. In general, our results highlighted a distinct difference between the early spring and early summer-collected pteropods. Overall, these shifts in the transcriptome likely reflect both the annual increase in food availability as well as physiological changes associated with their reproductive phenology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Field collection of L. h. antarctica</head><p>Pteropods (L. h. antarctica) were collected through the sea ice in McMurdo Sound in the southern Ross Sea during the austral early spring into early summer, with eight collections spanning from September 5th -16th, 2015 (hereafter, will be referenced to as simply, "early spring") and eight collections spanning from November 28th -December 7th, 2015 (hereafter, will be referenced to as simply, "early summer"). Pteropod collections were performed using a fixed-frame bongo net as previously described by . Bongo net deployments were performed at a single site on the sea ice using a research hut (77°50'53″ S, 166°35'59″ E) where the net was deployed to a depth of 50 m for 24-48 h. Seawater samples for carbonate chemistry were also taken at 50 m to match every collection of pteropods. Water sampling was performed using a Niskin sampler, and water samples were immediately transported back to McMurdo Station and fixed with saturated 0.02% mercuric chloride <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dickson et al., 2007a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Pteropod sample preparation</head><p>Immediately following bongo net retrieval, pteropods were removed from the cod ends and transferred to ambient temperature (−1.9°C) seawater. Pools of 10 individuals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen to ensure adequate material for analysis. Triplicate cryovials were preserved for each collection tow and stored at −80°C. Pteropods were also collected to measure shell size by preserving them in 50% ethanol (EtOH) for approximately 24 h, then increasing the EtOH concentration to 75% for long-term storage at 4°C. which the early spring pteropods were collected during the seasonal transition, and the early summer pteropods were collected following the transition, during a period of 24-h daylight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Seawater samples and carbonate chemistry</head><p>Carbonate chemistry was measured as previously described . Briefly, the pH of the fixed water samples was measured using SOP 6b <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dickson et al., 2007b</ref>) -a m-cresol spectrophotometric method (Sigma-Aldrich ® ) using a 1 cm path length. Salinity was measured using a calibrated conductivity probe (YSI 3100) and total alkalinity measurements were conducted with a Mettler-Toledo T50 and an open-cell titration stand <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dickson et al., 2007a)</ref>. The R package "seacarb" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Gattuso et al., 2017)</ref> was used to calculate total alkalinity, pH, and aragonite saturation states in the field assuming a −1.9°C temperature based on multi-year pH and temperature timeseries data <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kapsenberg et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Shell size</head><p>Shell size of the L. h. antarctica was measured as a proxy for overall body size. Shell size was determined for individual pteropods collected within the same tow (cohort) as the pteropods used for RNA sequencing. 20 pteropods for each tow were photographed using a Leica S8AP0 dissection scope and a Jenoptik ProgRes C3 camera with ProgRes Capture Pro (version 2.1.0.1). Pteropods were oriented in an apical view, and only shells that were completely intact were imaged. The images were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, USA), in which two shell diameter measurements were taken. One diameter measurement (Diameter A) was taken by measuring the width of the shell in a straight line, from the outer lip of the aperture to the opposite side of the shell, passing through the centermost whorl, or shell apex <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S1a)</ref>. A second diameter measurement (Diameter B) was taken by measuring the width of the shell in a straight line, perpendicular to Diameter A, passing through the shell apex ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1b)</ref>. After verifying the data were normally distributed and exhibited equal variance, a one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine if there was a significant effect of season on shell size. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP (version 11.2.0).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">RNA extraction and sequencing</head><p>Total RNA was extracted from each pool of 10 pteropods with triplicate samples from each tow. RNA extractions and quality verification were completed as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Johnson and Hofmann, 2018)</ref>. Two samples (one from September 12th and one from December 3rd) did not pass quality checks and were discarded at this step. Therefore, a total of 46 libraries (23 libraries per season) were generated for sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit. Completed libraries were checked for correct fragment lengths of 428 bp (300 bp insert + 128 bp sequencing adapters) and concentrations were quantified using a Qubit ® 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies). Sequencing was performed with a single pool of all 46 libraries on two lanes at the UC Davis Genome Center on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer using paired-end 100 base-pair sequences.</p><p>Sequence reads of each sample were trimmed to remove adapter sequences and low-quality base-pairs using the program TrimGalore! (version 0.4.2). Trimmed reads were aligned against the annotated L. h. antarctica transcriptome <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Johnson and Hofmann, 2016)</ref> using RSEM with default parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Li and Dewey, 2011)</ref>. Differential expression was evaluated using the negative binomial general linearized model as integrated in the R package edgeR-robust <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Zhou et al., 2014)</ref>, with a false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05 and an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05. Analysis was restricted to sequences that had at least 0.5 counts per million reads mapped for a minimum of 8 samples per season. This cutoff forced a sequence to be expressed with at least 10 reads in 8 out of the 46 samples and provided sufficient filtering such that expression in less than 3 tows would not be included in the analysis.</p><p>The normalized and log-transformed read-counts were used to estimate sample variance within and between seasons using a principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) with per-season standard error of weighted score as determined by principle component analysis (PCA) of the weighted covariance matrix as implemented in the R package vegan (version 2.5.2). Overall expression differences between seasons were tested for significance using the Adonis function as implemented in the R vegan package <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Oksanen et al., 2013)</ref>. To test the influence of all measured environmental variables on the principle components we used the envfit function available in the R vegan package to fit environmental factors onto the gene expression ordinations testing for the effect of each variable (total alkalinity, aragonite saturation state, pH, and light) with 1000 permutations. Gene expression between tows was also assessed using a discriminant analysis of principle components (DAPC) as implemented in the R package adegenet (v2.1.1). For this analysis the DAPC function was first called by grouping samples by tow and retaining all principle components and discriminant functions. This output was subsequently inputted into the optim.a.score function with 1000 simulations in order to determine the optimum number of principle components to retain in the DAPC analysis. The final DAPC function was therefore called using the first 8 principle components and 1 discriminate function that represents 80.4% of all variance in the samples.</p><p>To characterize differential gene expression between seasons, samples were equally weighted for early spring and early summer samples. Gene ontology enrichment analysis (Fisher's exact test, FDR &lt; 0.05) and KEGG mapping were conducted using the program Blast2GO (version 4.0). Network expression analysis was also performed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Langfelder and Horvath, 2008)</ref> with the normalized read-counts. Significant gene modules (p-value &lt; 0.05) with correlations &gt; 0.50 were used to measure gene ontology enrichment and KEGG mapping. Gene identifiers for each enriched set of gene ontologies were then used to compile heatmaps to visualize expression patterns across sampling days. Finally, longest open reading frames were transcribed to protein sequences for genes identified as being involved in spermatogenesis and analyzed using OrthoFinder (v.2.1.0) to identify one-to-one orthologues between L. h. antarctica and the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Emms and Kelly, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Environmental conditions during the time of collection</head><p>Seawater conditions during the collection period were relatively stable and reflected what might be expected for polar waters: stable, subzero temperatures, and pH levels that are somewhat lower than temperate open ocean waters due to the capacity of cold water to hold more dissolved CO 2 . Measured pH values for the early spring and the early summer collections were 8.010 ± 0.014 and 7.975 ± 0.0002, respectively <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. This represented a 9.1% change in aragonite saturation state (Ω aragonite ) across the sampling time frame. Overall, at our sample site, seawater physicochemical conditions were very stable between the early spring and early summer collections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1</head><p>A summary of seawater chemistry from samples coinciding with pteropod collections at the bongo net depth of 50 m. The pH values were calculated on the total scale assuming an in situ temperature of −1.9°C. The pCO 2 and aragonite saturation were then calculated at a hydrostatic pressure of 5 bar. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Results of the pteropod collections &amp; body size measurements</head><p>We routinely collected 200 to 1000 live pteropods using our bongonet method, and saw no observable mortality when inspecting the animals in the cod ends. Assessing shell morphometrics as a proxy for overall body size, shell dimensions of the pteropods showed an effect of season. Diameter A and Diameter B showed a high, positive correlation to one another (r 2 = 0.922). Only results from Diameter B analyses are presented here but results from Diameter A analyses are highly similar. The date of the tow, when incorporated as a random effect, had no effect and was therefore removed from our model. There was a significant effect of season on the size of the pteropod shells, in which pteropods collected in the early summer were larger than those collected in the early spring (F-ratio = 12.866, p-value = 0.0004, S1). On average, the pteropods exhibited a 5.4% increase in size between the early spring and early summer collections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Transcriptomic sequencing statistics</head><p>Sequencing of all 46 libraries on two lanes of a HiSeq 4000 resulted in 803.6 million reads with 17.5 ± 2.86 million reads per sample (range: 11.1-23.8 million reads per sample). RSEM successfully mapped 72.8% of trimmed reads to the previously published reference transcriptome <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Johnson and Hofmann, 2016)</ref> resulting in an average of 11.7 ± 2.25 million reads per sample representing 87,491 gene features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Differences in gene expression as a function of season</head><p>To assess transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression in L. h. antarctica collected in different seasons, we performed RNA-sequencing on early spring and summer collected individuals. There was a significant separation of samples by collection season <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>, with seasonspecific profiles within the PCA (Padonis = 0.001). Early spring samples were more dispersed, exhibiting higher within-season variability than early summer samples. Early summer samples were tightly clustered together, indicating these transcriptomes were converging in expression. Discriminant analysis of the principle components between tows further reinforces the effect of season on gene expression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2b)</ref> with clear defined separation between seasons and not individual tows. The measured environmental variables also had strong influence on gene expression (p-value &lt; 0.001) with the physical carbonate chemistry being most associated with spring collections and day length being most associated with the summer collections <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2C)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to general expression patterns that shifted with season, the edge-R robust gene expression analysis identified a large number of specific genes that had distinct expression profiles. Specifically, a total of 10,105 transcripts were up-regulated in the summer-collected pteropods relative to the early spring-collected pteropods, and 3667 transcripts were down-regulated in the summer samples relative to the early spring samples (Data S2). Enrichment analysis of the transcripts upregulated in the summer compared to the spring revealed 24 gene ontologies enriched in the summer (FDR &lt; 0.05, S2). Reducing these ontologies to the most specific branch (FDR &lt; 0.01) identified 9 specific gene ontologies (Table 2, Data S3). Among these ontologies the three dominant ontology terms that highlight physiological process that were identified as changing, were for processes associated with: (1) potassium ion transport, (2) GTPase activity, and (3) cytoskeleton structural components. Further, genes differentially expressed that were associated with these 3 dominant ontologies included multiple alphaand beta-tubulins, voltage-gated potassium channels, and a guanine nucleotide-binding G(i) alpha subunit. We used KEGG enzyme mapping to further explore the physiological pathways and processes changing among these up-regulated transcripts. This analysis identified genes coding for 5 enzymes associated with key components of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (Table 3, Data S4). These analyses also revealed multiple enzymes associated with protein and carbohydrate metabolism, including 6 enzymes involved in alanine, asparate, and glutamate metabolism, 4 enzymes involved in arginine and proline metabolism, 4 enzymes involved in galactose metabolism, and 3 enzymes involved in fructose and mannose metabolism <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 3</ref>, Data S4).</p><p>Enrichment analysis of the down-regulated transcripts revealed 193 enriched gene ontologies in summer compared to the early spring (FDR &lt; 0.05). Reducing these ontologies to the most specific branch (FDR &lt; 0.01) identified 29 specific gene ontologies <ref type="table">(Table 4</ref>, Data S3). Among the most abundant of these ontologies were regulation of DNAtemplated transcription, regulation of DNA replication initiation, DNA repair, and the mini chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex. Genes with suppressed expression among these ontologies included: cell division cycle and apoptosis regulator 1-like gene, estrogen receptor, tumor suppressor p-53-binding gene, and 3 histone methyltransferase genes. KEGG enzyme mapping of these down-regulated transcripts identified enzymes involved in pyrimidine metabolism, purine metabolism, and the phosphatidylinositol signaling system (Table 5, Data S4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Network patterns of changes in gene expression</head><p>Using WGCNA, 13 gene network modules were significantly correlated with season, the measured carbonate chemistry and day length. Of these, 5 modules had a correlation of greater than 0.5 (r 2 &gt; 0.05, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3A</ref>). Enrichment analysis using the Fisher's Exact Test (FDR &lt; 0.01) revealed significant gene enrichment in three of these modules: blue, green, and black <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3B</ref>). These are described below.</p><p>Module blue displayed statistical significance (pvalue = 5.81 × 10 −10 ) and was associated with increased expression (8432 transcripts) in the summer-collected pteropods (r 2 = 0.77) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3A)</ref>. Enrichment analysis revealed increased expression among 49 gene ontologies (FDR &lt; 0.05) that were reduced to a more specific list of 29 gene ontologies <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>, Data S5, FDR &lt; 0.01). Among the most abundant ontologies were those related to the cytoskeleton and microtubules, ion transport activity, and metabolism. Analysis of the distribution of these transcripts across the sampling period revealed clear separation by season of all 7469 transcripts associated with this module <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4)</ref>. KEGG enzyme mapping underscored the observed enrichment in metabolic processes by identifying 8 key enzymes associated with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, 12 enzymes associated with purine metabolism, and numerous enzymes associated with both protein and carbohydrate metabolism (Table 3, Data S6).</p><p>Module green had a moderate correlation (r 2 = 0.54) that was associated with increased expression (2547 transcripts) in spring-collected pteropods (p-value = 1.36 × 10 −4 ) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3B)</ref>. Enrichment analysis revealed 723 enriched gene ontologies (FDR &lt; 0.05) that were reduced to 513 gene ontologies using a 0.01 FDR cut-off. Gene ontologies were further reduced such that higher ontologies were excluded if a nested related-ontology was still statistically significant (FDR &lt; 0.01). These steps identified 108 specific gene ontologies that are important for maintaining DNA integrity, including protein phosphorylation, double strand break repair, damaged DNA binding, spermatogenesis, and the MCM complex <ref type="table">(Table 4</ref>, Data S5). Orthofinder identified 159 one-to-one orthologous sequences between all 2547 transcripts in this module and the 2482 genes associated with gametogenesis in the Pacific oyster (Data S7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dheilly et al., 2012)</ref>. KEGG enzyme mapping of this module revealed that 7 of these orthologous genes code for enzymes involved in the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, a pathway known to be expressed in connection with many cellular functions including spermatogenesis in Drosophila, crane flies, and mice (Table 5, Data S6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blume-Jensen et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fabian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Saul et al., 2004)</ref>. Overall, these analyses revealed that many critical components for DNA damage repair, DNA binding, the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, and genes potentially involved in gametogenesis/spermatogenesis were up-regulated in most of the spring samples <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5)</ref>.  Module black was a moderately correlated gene network (r 2 = 0.59) that was associated with increased expression (2080 transcripts) in the spring-collected pteropods (p-value = 1.87 × 10 −5 ) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3C</ref>). Enrichment analysis revealed increased expression of genes associated with carbohydrate binding <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. The transcripts associated with this pattern were identified as superoxide dismutase, perlucin 1, inositol oxygenase, calmodulin, and 11 zinc-finger-like genes. Analysis of the distribution of these transcripts across the sampling period revealed variability across collection dates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6</ref>). KEGG enzyme mapping of the transcripts in this module identified starch and sucrose metabolism as the second most abundant KEGG pathway in this module with three enzymes associated with the metabolism of glucose, glycogen, and cellulose <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 5</ref>, Data S6).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>To better understand the developmental progression and metabolic functions of the Antarctic sentinel species to ocean acidification, the shelled pteropod, L. h. antarctica, we measured seasonal changes in size distributions, and transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression between young adult pteropods collected in early spring and early summer. By implementing a combination of differential gene expression analysis with WGCNA to describe and compare the spring and summer transcriptomes of L. h. antarctica, we observed significant transcriptomic changes associated with multiple biological processes involved in cytoskeletal growth, metabolism, and developmental processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Differential gene expression as a function of season</head><p>Analysis of differential gene expression revealed that the majority of differentially expressed genes were up-regulated in the summer-collected pteropods. These up-regulated genes in this profile of the pteropod summer transcriptome were associated with multiple gene ontologies and known enzyme pathways that suggest pteropods in the summer are more metabolically active and investing resources for cytoskeletal growth. On the other hand, the genes down-regulated in summer, and therefore up-regulated in the spring samples, on the other hand were characterized by increases in expression of genes associated with DNA damage repair, neuronal signaling, and potentially gametogenesis. Together, these transcriptomic analyses describe season-driven changes in gene expression that may underpin the developmental progression and maturation of overwintering young male pteropods in the Southern Ocean.</p><p>Focusing on specific genes of interest within the summer transcriptomic response of L. h. antarctica identified a large number of transcripts that displayed elevated expression in summer-collected pteropods. Within this group of transcripts were genes that presented a fingerprint of metabolic activation in the summer. Specifically the enrichment of cytoskeletal genes, genes that code for components of potassium ion channels, and key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway indicated that individuals collected during the summer were more metabolically active than those collected in the early spring. These results indicated a differential in metabolic activity in the animals collected during the different seasons -here, possibly a mild metabolic depression during the early spring as they exit winter, combined with a physiological activation of metabolic activity in the early summer. This speculation concerning metabolism is indirectly supported by field data <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> Enriched gene ontologies among transcripts associated with decreased expression in the summer relative to the spring. GO terms without significant association are listed as NA.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Daly et al., 2017)</ref>. In a previous study, the availability of food sources such as Phaeocystis antarctica has previously been associated with similar patterns of metabolic suppression in L. h. antarctica during episodes of limited phytoplankton biomass <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Seibel and Dierssen, 2003)</ref>. Overall, these data indicate that the observed changes in gene expression may be linked to increasing food availability in the pelagic environment in the austral summer. In contrast, assessing the early spring transcriptomic response of L. h. antarctica revealed expression of genes associated with DNA repair, the regulation of meiosis and mitosis, and processes that may be connected with maturation. Specifically, we observed changes in transcripts that indicate pteropods exiting winter conditions were investing resources in maintaining genomic integrity. Here, for example, we identified genes in two important groups -(1) genes associated with the mini chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, and (2) genes coding for processes in the genome, here, sister chromatid cohesion, and chromatin binding. This suggests that overwintering young adult pteropods were investing resources in maintaining genomic integrity. The MCM complex is responsible for regulating chromosome replication during cell division <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lei and Tye, 2001)</ref>. In one study, the MCM complex displayed increased expression levels when transcription was coupled with increased levels of oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hubbi et al., 2011)</ref>; another study noted that MCM expression may also provide increased protection from DNA replication stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bai et al., 2016)</ref>. The second group -the genes associated with sister chromatid and chromatin function -are also central to cell division as they directly control chromosome segregation during anaphase. Along with these two processes, we identified an enrichment of gene ontologies associated with DNA-templated replication, the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, and nucleosome assemblies, further supporting the hypothesis of active cellular proliferation during the early spring season. Together, this pattern of gene expression suggests that in the spring season, pteropods are investing in cellular division and the maintenance of cellular replication in the light-limited subzero pelagic environment. Food-limitation alone does not explain this expression pattern as the increased expression of these genes relative to the food-rich summer suggests this response is associated with abiotic conditions. One such factor that may be impacting these individuals as they overwinter is oxidative stress. Notably, other studies have raised the possibility that the high oxygen environment of polar seas may increase oxidative stress that directly impacts cellular processes such as DNA replication in polar marine invertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abele and Puntarulo, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">WGCNA</head><p>The significant modules from WGCNA supported the differential expression analysis for seasonal changes, and aided in our understanding of how these differentially expressed genes may be interacting. This analysis showed that the measured changes in carbonate chemistry (pH, aragonite saturation, and total alkalinity) shared similar strength and direction of correlation with the spring-collected pteropods while length of daylight shared similar strength and direction of correlation with the summer-collected pteropods <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3A)</ref>. This important connection within the data suggests that the spring gene expression patterns in L. h. antarctica were most tightly associated with changes in water chemistry while the summer expression patterns were associated with increased light abundance and therefore most likely with increased food availability. Below we discuss in more detail the findings from each of these modules.</p><p>Module blue was the only module with a high correlation to summer and day length <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3A)</ref>. This module was enriched in genes related to cytoskeleton components, ion pumps, and metabolic processes. The increased expression of genes coding for cytoskeleton components <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>) identified in both the differential expression analysis and the WGNCA supports the hypothesis that individuals in the summer were actively expanding their cytoskeletal structures, a physiological signature of growth in these young adult pteropods. The blue module also highlighted the increased expression of genes involved in metabolic processes, a finding that agrees with the KEGG pathway mapping, wherein 8 enzymes from the glycolytic pathway were shown to be upregulated in the summer <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig S6)</ref>. This correlation between module blue and day length most likely reflects the transition to 24 h of sunlight in early summer that drives large phytoplankton blooms. This increase in food availability is potentially influencing pteropod metabolic activity and providing the energetic resources necessary for increased cytoskeletal growth.</p><p>In contrast, the green module was positively correlated with both the spring collections and the carbonate chemistry measurements. Transcripts associated with this module highlight a highly active suite of transcripts associated with DNA replication, DNA repair, cellular proliferation, and calcium signaling. Assessing expression profiles for this module revealed a discordant distribution of spring and summer samples with one summer sample that was positively correlated with the module, and four spring samples that were negatively correlated with the module <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5</ref>). This variation may be the result of sampling individuals from unsynchronized life history stages. This variation may also explain why transcripts with the gene ontology term spermatogenesis, and the 159 one-to-one gene orthologues with oyster gametogenesis genes were heavily represented within this module but include overlap with both the summer and spring sampling time-points.</p><p>To date, little is known about the reproductive timing of L. h. antarctica, with the 1910 Terra Nova Expedition providing the most detailed account of spawning season for McMurdo Sound. From those field reports, it is clear that mature adults were found in late December and continued to be present until late February. In addition, the majority of juvenile forms were not collected again until March <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Massy, 1920)</ref>. These observations, along with known reproductive phenology in Limacina retroversa <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hsiao, 1939)</ref>, suggests that individuals in McMurdo Sound have a progression of life history events where young adult males begin to mature either during the winter or light-limited spring, transition to females during early summer, and are gravid during mid-summer from late December to February. Offspring hatch from free-floating egg masses in March, and then spend a majority of their first winter slowly developing under the seasonal sea ice. In our data set, such a proposed time-line is supported by the increase of gametogenesis genes identified in the early spring and the lack of large adult individuals collected beneath the seasonal sea ice in the Ross sea.</p><p>The final significantly correlated module identified through the WGCNA analysis once again contained season overlap with two summer transcripts that were positively associated with this springcorrelated module. Module black, while rich in transcripts (2547 transcripts), was only associated with enrichment in a single gene ontology: carbohydrate binding. The abundance of these carbohydrate binding transcripts may reflect opportunistic feeding during the early spring to early summer transition in McMurdo Sound. This hypothesis potentially explains the variability of sample clustering observed in the heatmap <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6)</ref>. Finally, the association of this module with opportunistic feeding was further supported from KEGG enzyme mapping that listed starch and sucrose metabolism as the second most abundant KEGG pathway <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 5)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">WGCNA in marine environmental research</head><p>Within the field of marine molecular ecology and research examining organism-environment interactions, there is an emerging trend of using gene expression networks to capture a more holistic view of gene expression patterns that might otherwise be lost in a more pairwise differential gene expression analysis. In the marine environment, this approach has identified gene expression patterns associated with local adaptation to environmental variability in the mustard hill coral (Porites astreoides) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kenkel and Matz, 2016)</ref>, the role of transgenerational plasticity in response to low pH conditions in the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wong et al., 2018)</ref>, and has elucidated gene expression patterns associated with tidal cycle in Acropora hyacinthus (Ruiz-Jones and Palumbi, 2017). In this study, we used WGCNA to compare gene expression patterns between spring-acclimatized and summer-acclimatized pteropods when admittedly we had limited environmental data from the Ross Sea to frame their past environmental exposures. This approach identified 5 gene networks that were significantly correlated with the carbonate chemistry in the early spring sampling time-points. The influence of season on gene expression was also observed in the principle coordinate analysis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2C)</ref> wherein the carbonate chemistry variables were more associated with spring samples while day length was associated with summer samples. While there is an undeniable role of food availability that is driving the summer signal, the early spring signal may reflect the effects of the annual increase in pCO 2 below the winter sea ice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this study, we described changes in gene expression between collections of pteropods made in the early spring and early summer in McMurdo Sound in the southern Ross Sea. The general trend we observed was a global increase in gene expression in summer-collected pteropods with significant changes in genes involved in metabolic processes and cytoskeletal structure. In contrast, individuals collected during the spring season had increased expression of genes associated with DNA replication and DNA repair. By incorporating network analysis via WGCNA, we identified 3 large gene modules that were significantly different between season. Of these, module blue had the highest correlation with the summer season as is evident in the module heatmap that clearly clusters samples by season <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4)</ref>. This module was enriched for many core physiological and metabolic processes, in particular glycolysis. This observation is consistent with the expected increase in available food associated with the austral summer's 24 h of sunlight, providing for the proliferation of diatoms and dinoflagellates, the primary food source for L. h. antarctica <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hunt et al., 2008)</ref>. The other two modules (green and black) provide additional evidence that spring-collected pteropods are actively expressing genes involved in carbohyrate metabolism, cellular proliferation, and DNA repair. Together these three modules suggest that pteropods are actively developing across these seasonal transitions, with the spring transcriptome being characterized with genes associated with oxidative stress response suggesting that spring-collected pteropods under seasonal sea ice are investing energy reserves to cellular maintenance and maturation, and the increased food availability in summer provides the additional resources necessary for increasing expression of genes associated with cytoskeletal growth. Finally, the transcriptome profiles presented here provide a basis for understanding how additional stressors such as ocean acidification will affect this sentinel species in the Southern Ocean.</p></div>

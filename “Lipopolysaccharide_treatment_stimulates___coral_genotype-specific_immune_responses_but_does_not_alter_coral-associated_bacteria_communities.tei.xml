			<abstract>
				<p>Corals are comprised of a coral host and associated microbes whose interactions are mediated by the coral innate immune system. The diversity of immune factors identified in the Pocillopora damicornis genome suggests that immunity is linked to maintaining microbial symbioses while also being able to detect pathogens. However, it is unclear which immune factors respond to specific microbe-associated molecular patterns and how these immune reactions simultaneously affect coral-associated bacteria. To investigate this, fragments of P. damicornis and P. acuta colonies from Taiwan were subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment to stimulate immune responses and measure bacteria community shifts. RNA-seq revealed genotype-specific immune responses to LPS involving the upregulation of immune receptors, transcription factors, and pore-forming toxins. Bacteria 16S sequencing revealed significantly different bacteria communities between coral genotypes but no differences in bacteria communities were caused by LPS. Our findings confirm that Pocillopora corals activate conserved immune factors in response to LPS and identify transcription factors coordinating Pocillopora corals&apos; immune responses. Additionally, the strong effect of coral genotype on gene expression and bacteria communities highlights the importance of coral genotype in the investigation of coral host-microbe interactions.</p>

Pocillopora damicornis, a weedy Indo-Pacific coral, is a valuable model for investigation into coral innate immunity. The P. damicornis genome possesses a diversification of innate immunity genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cunning et al., 2018)</ref>, and several P. damicornis transcriptomic studies have found an upregulation of innate immune genes such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in response to the coral pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Vidal-Dupiol et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zhou et al., 2019)</ref>.

However, these studies did not account for coral genotype-specific responses and did not examine the effects on coral-associated bacteria communities. To build on these previous studies, we examined the effects of LPS exposure on coral gene expression and bacteria community composition of four genotypes of Pocillopora from southern Taiwan. We found that LPS activates a common set of transcription factors, and that LPS exposure does not change the overall composition of the coral-associated bacteria. Additionally, we found evidence for genotype-specific immune responses and coral-associated bacterial communities, despite the common set of transcription factors. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of genotypic variation in coral immune responses and highlight the differences in bacteria communities associated with different coral genotypes.</p></div>

Additionally, despite the upregulation of immune gene expression, no changes in coral-associated bacteria community were observed, indicating that LPS is suitable for studying corals' immune responses without interfering with the native coral-associated bacteria community.</p><p>Additionally, we found that the upregulation of TLRs and DMBT-1 in response to LPS corroborates previous reports of coral immune factors responding to bacterial MAMPs (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fuess et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fuess et al., , 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Williams et al., 2017)</ref>. Human DMBT-1 contains scavenger-receptor cysteine-rich domains and can exist as a membranebound PRR or as a secreted glycoprotein capable of agglutinating bacteria and activating the complement system <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Leito et al., 2011)</ref>. Due to this broad utility and activation in response to LPS, DMBT-1 may have a role in maintaining coral mucosal immunity and microbial homeostasis.</p><p>We also identified multiple upregulated transcription factors including ELF-4, ELK-1, HEY and HLF. ELF-4 plays regulates perforin <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Consensus effects of LPS on gene expression. A.

HEY and HLF were both upregulated in the overall DESeq2 model and in the genotype-specific model, indicating their potential as central, conserved transcriptional immune regulators <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Komorowska et al., 2017)</ref>. These observations suggest Pocillopora corals possess a broad transcriptional repertoire that regulates immune functions such as inflammation. Future studies identifying transcription factor binding sites will help in our understanding of the regulation of immune factors in corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dimos et al., 2019)</ref>. Multiple effector genes were also upregulated including PIK3AP1, PARP-14, MPEG-1 and PsTX-60B (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). PIK3AP1 links TLR signaling to PI3K activation, a process that prevents excess cytokine production <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Maruoka et al., 2005)</ref>. PARP-14 is similarly involved in the modulation of the extrinsic coagulation cascade, macrophage activation and protection of lymphocytes against apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cho et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Iwata et al., 2016)</ref>. These two genes may function in corals to prevent excessive inflammation and ensure cell survival following immune challenge. MPEG-1 and PsTX-60B are pore forming proteins with MACPF domains that can initiate bacterial lysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Benard et al., 2015)</ref>. This is the first evidence in corals of LPS-induced upregulation of pore-forming proteins, which likely have critical roles in bacterial lysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Pocillopora corals demonstrate genotype-specific immune responses to LPS treatment</head><p>Taxonomic classification within Pocillopora remain the subject of debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Poquita-Du et al., 2017)</ref>, but intra-generic and genotype-specific differences in gene expression have been previously documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Poquita-Du et al., 2019)</ref>. In this experiment genotype was the main driver of gene expression, with different coral genotypes exhibiting different immune gene expression patterns in response to LPS. For example, the ETS-like transcription factors were uniquely differentially expressed among genotypes and this may affect downstream function like the onset of inflammation, apoptosis, and/or autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fuess et al., 2016)</ref>. These genotypic differences may also reflect adaptation of different coral genotypes to different environmental conditions and microbial associations. Future studies of Pocillopora coral gene expression should aim to include the maximum number of genotypes possible and ensure correct species identification by using, at minimum, the mtORF marker to differentiate genotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Johnston et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The six consensus Pocillopora LPS-responsive DEGs include transcription factors and immune signaling intermediates</head><p>Only consensus six genes were differentially expressed in all of the genotype specific DESeq models and upregulated overall in response to LPS treatment. Three were transcription factors (HEY, HLF, and BHLHE40) involved in immune regulation and cell differentiation, one was a circadian rhythm protein cryptochrome, and the other two had no annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jarjour et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Komorowska et al., 2017)</ref>. In corals, HEY has been shown to be upregulated in response to Vibrio coralliilyticus and Oceanospirillales bacteria challenge in Montipora aequituberculata, leading to the hypothesis that HEY is an important modulator for coral immune cell differentiation <ref type="bibr">(van de Water et al., 2018)</ref>. HLF maintains mammalian quiescent hematopoietic stem cells during LPS treatment and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Komorowska et al., 2017)</ref> BHLHE40 is involved the mediation of macrophage proliferation and repression of inflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Jarjour et al., 2019)</ref>. Collectively the upregulation of these transcription factors indicates a tight immune transcriptional network that is responding to LPS. Coral cryptochromes are responsive to light, and have a circadian rhythm involved in the timing of spawning. In other model systems, cryptochromes have been implicated in immunity through their indirect modulation of cytokine expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cao et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Narasimamurthy et al., 2012)</ref>. While this interaction is not understood within Pocillopora, it may reflect a connection between circadian rhythm and immune response <ref type="bibr">(van de Water et al., 2018)</ref>. Future investigation into these genes, in particular the transcription factors, will tell us more about the mechanisms underlying immune response, and subsequent downstream targets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Pocillopora coral genotype affects the bacteria community composition</head><p>Our results on bacteria community composition were similar to previous studies of Taiwan Pocillopora corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brener-Raffalli et al., 2018)</ref>, however with coral genotype being the primary driver of differences. Considering the strong genotype effects on both gene expression and bacteria community composition, it is likely that coral host immunity-microbiome interactions may exert control over the structuring of their bacteria communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Epstein et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">van de Water et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ziegler et al., 2019)</ref>. Coral immune systems can distinguish between pathogenic versus commensal bacteria <ref type="bibr">(van de Water et al., 2018)</ref> and possess a large diversity of PRRs that enable specificity in MAMP recognition (Cunning et al., 2018; Poole and Weis, 2014). Furthermore, P. damicornis and their bacterial communities were <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. LPS exposure has negligible effects on the coral bacteria community.

In future experiments, the selection of alternate LPS variants from different bacteria strains may produce different immune reactions and reveal alternate immune receptors and pathways. 4.5. Pocillopora spp. bacteria community is not directly altered by shortterm LPS exposure There were no significant differences in coral-associated bacteria community alpha and beta-diversity between fragments in the control versus LPS exposure treatments, and also no differentially abundant ASVs between treatments. This suggests that acute exposure to LPS does not induce shifts in the overall coral-associated bacteria community composition or the relative abundance of bacterial taxa. In the microbiota of the mouse lung, differences in the bacteria community composition were observed following the intratracheal injection of LPS, however, these differences were only observed after three days post injection <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Poroyko et al., 2015)</ref>. In this experiment the lack of significant differences in the coral-associated bacteria community between control and LPS treatment samples could be due to the short duration LPS exposure. In the future, sampling at later time points may yield detectable shifts in the coral-associated bacteria community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>This study demonstrates the conserved immune pathway response to LPS while highlighting the role of coral genotype in driving both gene expression and bacteria community abundances. We hypothesize that different coral genotypes have specific immune responses that are regulating their bacterial microbiomes and involved in resilience against pathogens. Altogether, our results are consistent with previous studies of other corals and provide the basis for future investigation into the influences of coral genotype and bacteria community composition on the dose-response, timing, and cell-specificity of corals' innate immune responses to bacterial MAMPs and infectious pathogens.</p></div>		</body>

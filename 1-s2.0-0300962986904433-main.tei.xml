				<p>Seasonal variations in the concentrations of 19 free amino acids (FAA) were measured in whole body homogenates of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pseudolimnaeus. 2. The greatest total FAA concentrations of 226.9 and 286.4 nmol/mg dry wt were observed in April and May, and were followed by a decline through the summer months. 3. Values slowly increased through the fall, reached a second smaller peak in early winter and then dropped drastically during the colder, winter months. 4. The pattern of relative concentrations of individual free amino acids in G. pseudolimnaeus was found to be similar to that of other freshwater invertebrates. 5. Alanine consistently represented the most abundant amino acid (16.2-22.4%) throughout the entire year. 6. Arginine and leucine exhibited the next greatest abundances and comprised an average of 10.2 and 10.4% of the total FAA concentration, respectively.</p>

This paper will primarily deal with the influence of accessory factors, specifically season, on the FAA pool of the freshwater scud Gammarus pseudolimnaeus <ref type="bibr">Bousfield (Crustacea, Amphipoda)</ref>. In developing an in situ biochemical indicator of stress, seasonal variation is the most important accessory factor to be considered because many individual accessory factors such as diet, age, reproductive condition and molting stage are implicit in any seasonal fluctuations observed.

Since the reaction of the amino acids with OPA requires the presence of a free amine group, this method does not allow quantification of proline or hydroxyproline. Separation of amino acids was accomplished by a 40 min linear gradient (17-73%) of solvent A (100% methanol) to B (0.1 M sodium acetate; pH 7.0) using a 5 pm, ultrasphere', ODS C-18 column preceded by a pellicular ODS ocatadecyl (37--53 pm) guard column.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The mean total FAA concentrations of G. pseudolimnaeus varied three-fold over the 12 month study period.</p><p>Peak concentrations of 226.9 and 286.4 nmol/mg total FAA dry wt, were observed in April and May, and were followed by a decline through the summer months ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1; Table 1</ref>). Values slowly increased through the fall, had a second smaller peak in early winter and then dropped drastically during the colder, winter months. The observed patterns were identical when FAA concentrations were normalized to either total protein or dry wt. We felt that normalization to a second parameter, such as protein, was required to ensure that the seasonal pattern observed was not an artifact caused by the disproportionate contribution of exoskeleton to the weight of the smaller organisms.</p><p>Since the surface-to-volume ratio decreases as the organism grows and the FAA pool was normalized to the wt of the entire organism, the wt of the smaller organisms will likely contain a larger proportion of exoskeleton, a chitinous material devoid of FAAs. This being the case, the FAA pool of the smaller organisms collected during the summer months could be artificially diluted by the greater exoskeleton weight. However, normalization to protein does not completely ensure that normalization bias was not present. Although inorganic constituents and chitin are the primary components of exoskeleton, protein can also be important <ref type="bibr">(Dali, 1965)</ref> and thus may introduce the same bias as dry wt. Another important </p></div>

Also included are the seasonal changes in temperature (A). Organisms collected in months with the same letter place below had total FAA concentrations (nmol/mg dry wt) which were not significantly (a = 0.05) different.</p><p>factor often overlooked when normalizing biochemical measurements is that the parameter used for normalization cannot change as a result of the treatment. In the present investigation, whole amphipod per cent proteins/mg dry wt did not change significantly during the study period (a &gt; 0.05).</p><p>Other studies which have investigated the seasonal changes in the total FAA concentration of aquatic invertebrates have reported conflicting results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Feng et al. (1970)</ref> reported total FAA concentrations in hemolymph of the oyster Crossostrea oirginica were greatest during the winter months, opposite to the results found in the present study. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ferguson (1975)</ref> found the total FAA concentrations of gonad and digestive gland tissue of starfish to be greatest in winter and least in the summer. In both of these studies, seasonal changes in the total FAA concentrations were related to the reproductive cycle of the organism. Similar to the present study, Cook et al. <ref type="bibr">(1972)</ref> found the total FAA pool of adult barnacles, Balanus balanoides to decrease during the winter and reach a minimum in spring, however the greatest FAA concentration was observed in the fall. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Heath and Barnes (1970)</ref> found no consistent seasonal trends in the total non-protein nitrogen of the common shore crab Curcinus maenas. Similarly, Zandee et al. <ref type="bibr">(1980)</ref> measured seasonal variation in the total FAA concentration of different organs of the marine mollusk Myths edulis and found no seasonal pattern, although concentrations of specific amino acids did change significantly. In freshwater crayfish the total FAA concentration was significantly greater in May as compared with February <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(McWhinnie, 1972)</ref>. These differences were specifically related to the molt cycle of the crayfish with the total FAA concentration increasing during the premolt period in May. Since in the majority of cases alterations in the total FAA pool have been related to accessory factors such as molt status, reproductive condition and/or diet, it is not surprising that different species from different ecosystems exhibit different seasonal patterns.</p><p>The total FAA concentration of G. pseudolimnaeus is similar to that reported for other freshwater invertebrates. Five different freshwater oligochaete species had total FAA concentrations which ranged from 7.8 to 50.6 nmol/mg dry wt . Similarly small concentrations of total FAA were reported for the copepod Diaptomus sp., which contained 80.9 nmol/mg <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jeffries and Alzara, 1970)</ref>. The bivalves Ligumia subrostrata and Corbiculu jhminea had considerably smaller total FAA concentrations of 23.6 nmol/mg dry wt and 2.78 nmol/mg wet wt, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hanson and Dietz, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Graney, 1986)</ref>. These low FAA concentrations are not surprising, however, since organisms with tissue in direct contact with the external media, such as clams, have adapted to freshwater by maintaining a low osmotic gradient between tissue and water. Arthropods, on the other hand, have a fairly impermeable exoskeleton, which allows them to maintain a greater internal osmolyte concentration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gardner et al. (1981)</ref> reported a total FAA concentration of 428 nmol/mg dry wt for the cladoceran Drzphnia magna. Abdominal muscle of the crayfish Astacus leptodactylus had a total FAA concentration of 545.7 and 466 nmol/mg dry wt, respectively <ref type="bibr">(van Marrewijk and Ravestern, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">van Marrewijk and Zandee, 1975)</ref>. Similarly, crayfish of the family Orconectes had total FAA concentrations of 34.6116.3 nmol/mg wet wt in abdominal muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(McWhinnie et al., 1972)</ref> and 42.7-50.2 nmol/mg wet wt in ventral nerve cord <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lin and Cohen, 1973)</ref>. These concentrations are considerably greater than those reported for the amphipods investigated in the present study. A possible reason for this difference is that values reported for the crayfish were for specific tissues, whereas in our study, whole organisms were analyzed. This being the case, total FAA concentrations reported for G. pseudolimnaeus may be biased toward smaller concentrations due to "dilution" of the homogenate by tissues or structures which have low concentrations of amino acids. This may be especially true with regard to the exoskeleton, which contributes proportionally more to the dry wt of the organism than the total FAA pool.</p><p>The concentrations of individual amino acids, normalized to dry wt and protein, are presented in <ref type="table">Table  1</ref>. The percentage compositions of each amino acid relative to the total FAA pool are presented in <ref type="table">Table  2</ref>. During the entire year, alanine consistently represented the most abundant amino acid (16.2-22.4%). Arginine and leucine were the next most abundant comprising an average of 10.2 and 10.4% of the total pool, respectively. The relative contribution of the remaining amino acids varied considerably, ranging between 1 and lo%, although both asparagine and aspartic acid were consistently less than 1%.</p><p>The pattern of relative concentrations of individual FAA in G. pseudolimnaeus is similar to that of other freshwater invertebrates.</p><p>Alanine, arginine and leucine comprised approximately 40% of the total FAA concentration in amphipods. Similarly, crayfish abdominal muscle had concentrations of glycine, arginine and alanine which comprised up to 73% of the total FAA concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(van Marrewijk and Ravestein, 1974)</ref>. Alanine and arginine have also been found to predominate in the nerve cord of the crayfish Orconectes immunis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lin and Cohen, 1973)</ref>, whole body of the freshwater cladoceran Diaptomus sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jeffries and Alzara, 1970)</ref>, whole body of the freshwater bivalve Ligumia substrastrata <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hanson and Dietz, 1976)</ref> and whole body of the trichopteran larvae Hydropsyche betteni <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Haag and Sullivan, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>In crustaceans, alanine is formed by the transamination of pyruvate with glutamate <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Claybrook, 1983)</ref>. The pivotal position of pyruvate with respect to glycolysis and the TCA cycle renders alanine concentrations susceptible to alterations due to these important biochemical pathways. The relatively great proportion of arginine in the total FAA pool can be attributed to the importance of arginine phosphate in crustacean muscle contraction <ref type="bibr">(Onnen and Zebe, 1983)</ref>. During muscular work, the depletion of phosphagen stores results in an accumulation of arginine, which is subsequently converted to octopine by octopine dehydrogenase.</p><p>Glycine and taurine concentrations, which are normally relatively high in crustaceans, were relatively low in G. pseudolimnaeus. These two amino acids are considered primary osmotic effecters in the Taurine, a sulfonic amino acid, is not found in freshwater molluscs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Awapara, 1962)</ref>, however it has been observed in freshwater crustaceans <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(van Marrewijk and Ravestein, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lin and Cohen, 1973)</ref> and is believed to function as an emulsifying agent in gastric juices <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Holwerda and Vonk, 1973)</ref>. Other amino acids found to predominate in freshwater crustaceans include glutamic acid, aspartic acid, proline and histidine <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lin and Cohen, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gardner et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Duchateau-Bosson and Florkin, 1961)</ref>. None of these amino acids predominate in G. pseudolimnaeus, in fact, aspartic acid was least abundant of all the amino acids measured.</p><p>Comparison of the relative composition of specific amino acids indicates that at certain times of the year, the profiles of relative concentration of the FAA are different. This was especially true in March, when the percentages of six amino acids were either significantly greater or less than all the other months <ref type="table">(Table 2</ref>). In addition, a significant decrease in the ratio of essential to non-essential (E/NE) amino acids was observed in March. In most crustaceans, the NE amino acids dominate the FAA pool, comprising between 58 and 78% of the total pool <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Claybrook, 1983)</ref>. In G. pseudolimnaeus there was a fairly equal proportion of E and NE amino acids in all months except March, where the E and NE amino acids comprised 38.7 and 61.03% of the total concentration,</p><p>respectively. There was a significant (a = 0.05) increase in the relative proportion of the NE amino acids glutamate, glycine and taurine and a decrease in the E amino acids isoleucine, leucine and valine. A change in the E/NE ratio can be indicative of a change in protein metabolism relative to the energetic status of the organism.</p><p>Since the total FAA concentration changed each month, it is difficult to determine whether the change in the E/NE ratio is caused by an absolute increase in NE amino acids (NEAA), decrease in E amino acids (EAA) or a combination of both. July is the only month in which total FAA concentration was not significantly different from March, and thus the only month in which an appropriate comparison of the absolute values of the E and NE amino acids can be made. However, it should also be noted that July was the only other month, besides March, in which the profile of relative FAA concentrations seemed to be different. The relative concentrations of the EAA and NEAA for July and March are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>. Also in this table are the sums of the amino acids whose percentage contribution to the total FAA concentration in March were significantly different from other months. For the NEAA, the concentrations in July and March were not significantly different, although there seemed to be a slight increase when only considering isoleucine, leutine, methionine and valine. However, the concentration of EAA was significantly (CL = 0.05) less in l In March samples, the percentage contribution of these amino acids to the total pool was significantly (P = 0.05) higher than in other months.

Therefore, the reduction in the E/NE ratio is most likely the result of a decrease in the concentration of EAA. significance of toxicant induced changes in the FAA pool of field organisms.</p><p>Essential amino acids are those which cannot be synthesized by an organism, or cannot be synthesized at a great enough rate, such that a dietary source is required to meet the nutritional requirements of the organism. In mammals, a decrease in the E/NE ratio can be indicative of a dietary protein deficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Munro, 1970)</ref>. This decrease is a result of a depletion of EAA, with the NEAA generally remaining constant. Protein catabolism, a known consequence of starvation in both vertebrates and invertebrates, may be initiated by the reduced concentrations of EAA <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Munro, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Claybrook, 1983)</ref>. Increased protein catabolism, whether initiated by energetic <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bayne, 1973)</ref> or biosynthetic requirements, can result in an alteration of the total FAA concentration as well as pattern of indivudual FAA of aquatic invertebrates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Riley (1980)</ref> found that during starvation, protein degradation increased, and over time, the composition of the FAA pool and that of protein hydrolysate became increasingly similar. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Riley (1980)</ref> also observed a decrease in the E/NE ratio, however, he attributed the change to an increase in NEAA and felt that the EAA were conserved for protein synthesis. In the present study, it is possible that the decreased E/NE ratio observed in March was the result of dietary deficiencies or starvation. March was the end of the cold season, during which temperatures were near freezing for 3-4 months <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>. Feeding activity was likely to be minimal during this time period, and the amphipods may have had a negative scope for growth. This would indicate that normal maintenance requirements exceed caloric intake, thus forcing the organism to mobilize energy storage reserves to maintain homeostasis. During the cold winter months, when food availability is greatly reduced, marine bivalves are often in a negative scope for growth during which time they rely mostly on protein reserves to meet energetic requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bayne, 1973)</ref>. If this were the case in the present study, the decrease in the E/NE ratio may be indicative of the changes in protein metabolism.</p><p>The quantitative and qualitative composition of an organism's diet can directly influence its FAA pool. As discussed above, quantitative dietary deficiencies can alter protein metabolism and subsequently the relative composition of both essential and nonessential amino acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Munro, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Riley, 1980)</ref>. Similarly, qualitative changes in diet can alter the composition of an organisms FAA pool. For organisms which do not feed continuously, such as humans, diet generally has little influence on the FAA pool. Immediately following protein ingestion, the tissue and body fluid FAA pool may rise dramatically, however, these changes are only transitory and amino acids rapidly return to pre-ingestion concentrations, via increased protein synthesis of amino acid oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Munro, 1970)</ref>. Amphipods are considered continuous feeders <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Marchant and Hynes, 1981)</ref> and the constant flux of FAA via protein digestion may have a more consistent influence on the FAA pool of the organisms. Given this, changes in the qualitative aspects of an organisms diet may influence the concentration of amino acid in its tissue and fluids. Amphipod growth will vary under different regimes <ref type="bibr">(Barlocher and Kendrich, 1973)</ref>, which indicates that there are optimal and suboptimal dietary conditions. Whether the FAA pool is altered under these different dietary regimes is unknown. However, protein metabolism will definitely be different in organisms with varying growth rates and, since the FAA pool is a highly dynamic pool of biomolecules responsive to alterations in protein metabolism, it is very possible that changes in dietary quality will alter the FAA pool. The primary nutritional source for the amphipods is the microbial flora which colonization leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hynes, 1972)</ref>. Since this colonization is successional, in that the microbial community changes throughout the year, it is possible that the nutritional quality of the food may also change seasonally, thus affecting the organisms' FAA pool.</p><p>Seasonal fluctuations in the total FAA concentration or relative concentrations of individual FAA may be attributed to a variety of interrelated accessory factors. The primary factors which can affect FAA on a seasonal basis would be diet, reproductive condition and molt cycle status. Other factors which also need to be considered are sex, temperature, photoperiod, developmental stage and salinity. Since all of these accessory factors are simultaneously interacting over time, it is extremely difficult to separate the effect of the individual factors. However, the influence of all of these factors will be implicit in seasonal changes in the FAA pool. In addition, when developing a biochemical indicator of stress, one is not necessarily interested in the effect of any individual accessory factor on the biochemical parameter of interest, but rather in the combined influence of the factors over time and between locations. Since the seasonal variation in FAA is the result of the combined influence of all the above accessory factors, it is, along with geographic variation, the primary component required to interpret the potential fluctuates seasonally.</p><p>In the present study, seasonal changes in both the quantity and quality of the amphipods' diet may have contributed to the seasonal fluctuations in FAAs. In March, the end of the winter season, the total FAA concentration was at its lowest level and the profile of relative FAA concentrations was considerably different than in the other months. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cook et al. (1972)</ref> studied seasonal changes in the FAA pool of adult barnacles Balunus bahoides. They found that starvation during the summer and winter-spring months caused a significant decrease in the total FAA concentration, however starvation during fall-winter time period resulted in an increase in the FAA concentration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cook et al. (1972)</ref> concluded that the effect on the FAA concentration depends upon what substrate is being mobilized to meet the energy demands of the organism: mobilization of carbohydrates will increase the total FAA concentration while metabolism of lipid and/or protein will cause the total FAA concentration to decrease. Since the primary energy reserve and an organism's dietary source may shift during the year <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bayne, 1973)</ref>, it is not surprising that the total FAA concentration The reproductive cycle in aquatic invertebrates is an extemely complex process, controlled by a variety of indogenous and exogenous cues; including temperature, photoperiod and nutritional status. Seasonal variations in energy metabolism, as reflected by changes in the relative composition of glycogen, lipid and protein storage reserves, are directly related to gametogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Zandee et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gabbot and Bayne, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Newell and Bayne, 1980)</ref>. The concentrations of phosphoadenylates have been observed to vary with reproductive condition in freshwater clams <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Giesy and Dickson, 1981)</ref>. The time frame of gonadal maturation is unknown in G. pseudolimnaeus, as are the seasonal changes in the concentrations of glycogen and lipids. However, assuming that the reproductive cycle is accompanied by changes in energy metabolism, then changes in the FAA pool similar to those found in other organisms would be expected. In a variety of marine invertebrates, changes in glycine have been directly linked to reproductive conditions. Maturation of male gonads in the cirripede Balanus balanus <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barnes, 1963)</ref>, the sea anemone Bunodosoma cavernala <ref type="bibr">(Kasschau and McCommas, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Howard and Kasschau, 1980)</ref> and the starfish Echinaster modestus <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ferguson, 1975)</ref> results in a significant accumulation of glycine in gonadal tissue. In the present study, no increase in glycine concentration was observed during the reproductively active period. However, since whole organisms were analyzed and males and females were combined, changes in the male gonadal tissue may simply have been obscured. Other studies have also shown amino acids to vary with the reproductive cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Zandee et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cook et al., 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barnes et al., 1963)</ref>. The changes observed in these studies, although correlated with reproductive conditions, were more directly the result of changes in energy metabolisms which are concurrent with reproductive maturation.</p><p>The periodic molting which all crustaceans undergo is an extremely complex, hormonallycontrolled process essential for the growth of the organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Skinner, 1985)</ref>. Molting can be subdivided into five major stages, each of which is characterized by changes in exoskeleton hardness and cellular and biochemical processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Skinner, 1985)</ref>. The frequency of molting is greatest in early instar organisms, with the length of the intermolt period increasing with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Sutcliffe and Caruck, 1981)</ref>. During intermolt and premolt, a variety of metabolic changes occur which prepare the organism for ecdysis. Blood glucose levels increase, glycogen and lipid reserves accumulate in the midgut gland and plasma and tissue FAA change <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barclay et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chang and O'Connor, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Yamaoka and Skinner, 1976)</ref>. In freshwater crayfish, tissue FAA levels increased two-to three-fold during premolt <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(McWhinnie et al., 1972)</ref>. This increase may be the result of changes in protein metabolism, likely to have been initiated by hormonal changes, or may simply be a response to the increased hemolymph osmolarity which normally occurs prior to ecdysis, presumably to enhance water intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Tucker and Costlow, 1975)</ref>. In the present study, it is impossible to distinguish changes resulting from a difference in the stage of the molt cycle, from other accessory factors. For the early instar organisms observed in July and August, during which the molt cycle interval is relatively short (5-15 days), there is a greater probability of having organisms collected at different stages of the molt cycle. This would result in greater variation in the measured FAA pool. The coefficients of variations for the total FAA pool of amphipods collected in July and August <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref> are two to three times greater than most other months. This increased variation could be the result of measuring FAAs in organisms at different stages of their molt cycle.</p><p>The FAA pool can also change with the development stage of an organism <ref type="bibr">(Anderson, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Levenbook and Dinamarca, 1966)</ref>. In larvae of the chironomid Chironimus tentans, the hemolymph FAA concentrations changed during the fourth instar <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Firling, 1977)</ref>. In the present study, the amphipods FAA pool increased during the initial 5 months of growth, from July to December. Initially it was thought that this increase could be an artifact, in that normalizations to dry wt artificially lowered the FAA concentration because of the disproportionate contribution of the exoskeleton to the dry wt (see earlier). However we feel this is a real increase, since normalization to protein produced the same trend. It must be remembered however, that this increase does not necessarily indicate any inherent metabolic changes resulting in a larger FAA pool, but may simply reflect the influence of accessory factors such as diet.</p><p>Seasonal fluctuations in the FAA pool does not limit the usefulness of FAAs as an in situ biochemical indicator of stress. Knowledge of seasonal trends will allow the investigator to consider these fluctuations when interpreting the significance of changes potentially caused by toxicant exposure. As long as the "normal" concentration is known for a particular time of year and/or location, one can, with a reasonable amount of certainty, determine if the changes are the result of toxicant effects. The larger the background data base to which alterations can be compared, the greater ones ability will be to isolate toxicant-related alterations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Seasonal changes in the total free amino acid (FAA) concentrations of G. pseudolimnneus.</figDesc></figure>

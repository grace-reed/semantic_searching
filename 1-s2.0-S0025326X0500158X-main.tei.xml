			<abstract>
				<p>Coral reefs within the Florida Keys are disappearing at an alarming rate. Coral cover in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary declined by 38% from 1996 to 2000. In 2000, populations of Montastraea annularis at four sites near Molasses Reef within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and one reef within Biscayne National Park were sampled on a quarterly basis. Anecdotal observations showed corals at AlinaÕs Reef in Biscayne National Park appeared healthy in March, but experienced an acute loss of coral cover by August. Cellular Diagnostic analysis indicated that AlinaÕs Reef corals were in distress: they had been afflicted with a severe oxidative damaging and protein-denaturing stress that affected both the corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. This condition was associated with a significant xenobiotic detoxification response in both species, reflecting probable chemical contaminant exposure. These results demonstrate that applying a Cellular Diagnostic approach can be effective in helping to identify stress and its underlying causes, providing diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of coral health.</p>

The causes of these devastating declines, however, remain largely unknown.</p><p>The primary question facing resource managers is whether coral declines result from climatic forces, local or regional anthropogenic factors, or the synergistic effects of these different forces. If declines are caused solely by global factors, there may be little resource managers can do to immediately ameliorate the problem. However, if local (defined as a restricted region of about 50 km) factors contribute to coral declines, resource managers may be able to respond with mitigation efforts. For example, if urban effluent is the principle stressor, discharges can be managed and regulated. Unfortunately, conventional coral monitoring and mapping protocols have had limited success in demonstrating the causes of coral reef declines in the Florida Keys and elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pennisi, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Vasseur and Cossu-Leguille, 2003)</ref>. Most monitoring programs were designed to establish baseline conditions and determine trends, not to identify sources of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Risk, 1999)</ref>. The inability of coral monitoring programs to pinpoint factors affecting local reef declines makes it difficult for resource managers to effectively manage coral reefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jameson et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jameson et al., , 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Downs et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Resource management can be more effective if a coordinated, interdisciplinary (e.g., biochemistry, biology, chemistry, geology, and toxicology) approach is used to rapidly diagnose population health and accurately forecast expected outcomes of different mitigation strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Risk, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Vasseur and Cossu-Leguille, 2003)</ref>. We recently developed a novel biotechnology that employs a suite of diagnostic indicators to assess the cellular-physiological condition of reef-building corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Downs et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Downs et al., , 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brown et al., 2002a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Woodley et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fauth et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Downs, 2005)</ref>. Cellular Diagnostics focuses a comprehensive array of biotechnologies to diagnose population health, and was tailored to determine coral-health condition and help identify mechanisms of coral pathologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Downs et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Downs et al., , 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Brown et al., 2002a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Woodley et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Cellular Diagnostics is used to measure changes in cellular parameters, allowing: (1) assessment of cellular-physiological condition of an individual or population, (2) identification of putative stressors, either by direct measurement of the stressor or by profiling stressor-specific effects, and (3) forecasting higher-order behavior based on an understanding of cellular-level processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Downs, 2005)</ref>. Parameters that are measured as part of a cellular diagnosis include membrane integrity and composition, anti-oxidant redox status, protein metabolic condition, xenobiotic detoxification pathways, intra-cellular metal regulation, and genomic integrity. Cellular Diagnostics provides a new approach to environmental-health assessment, based on concepts and methodologies already used in medical diagnostics and epidemiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Downs, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Previously, we used this Cellular Diagnostics approach to demonstrate that oxidative stress was a factor in the pathology of seasonal coral bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Downs et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Downs et al., , 2002a</ref><ref type="bibr">Brown et al., 2002a,b)</ref>. Here, we assess the health of corals at five sites near Molasses Reef within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary during a non-El Niño/La Niñ a climatic year (2000) and an additional reef located at some distance from these sites within another protected area: Biscayne National Park. Our objectives were to: (1) document baseline, seasonal changes in cellular parameters during a non-elevated sea-surface temperature period, (2) provide an interpretive diagnosis of the health condition of these corals in 2000, and (3) determine whether stressful factors affecting corals in the Florida Keys could include local sources (e.g., agriculture and urban run-off, high-boat density, etc.) in addition to known climatic forces such as El Niñ o/La Niñ a phenomena.</p></div>

We also sampled one site at AlinaÕs Reef, within Biscayne National Park (BNP), Homestead, FL, USA (site 5). We included it as a northern, shallow (6 m) site, potentially influenced by agricultural and landfill runoff and operations of two pressured-water nuclear reactors at Turkey Point.</p><p>We collected samples (2.5 cm diameter) from the same five colonies at each site in March, June, August, </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ROOH þ 2GSH !

GPx is inducible in response to oxidative stress Glutathione-s-transferase (GST) The name glutathione transferase refers to only one of several enzymatic activities that these enzymes possess.</p><p>Other activities include glutathione-dependent isomerase activity, which is important in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and selenium-independent glutathione peroxidase activity (alpha and theta subclasses of GST). Glutathione transferases are usually associated with detoxification by conjugation of glutathione to genotoxic and cytotoxic xenobiotic electrophiles derived from drugs, carcinogens, and environmental pollutants. During a xenobiotic challenge, glutathione can be conjugated to a xenobiotic by GST, representing a major detoxification pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sies, 1999)</ref>. Additionally, GST detoxifies DNA hydroperoxides, playing an important role in DNA repair. GST also acts as one of the main defenses for detoxifying 4-hydroxynonenal in the cell (DeZwart et al., 1999) P-glycoproteins 160 and 180</p><p>(MDR or MXR--multixenobiotic resistance protein) P-glycoprotein plays a role in xenobiotic detoxification. Currently, it is believed that P-glycoprotein effectively processes certain xenobiotics and cellular toxins to exit the cell. Sustained exposure to certain xenobiotics causes an increase in the cellular level of P-glycoproteins. P-glycoproteins are members of a superfamily of proteins called the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette that act as channels and transporters of solutes across membranes. Induction of certain P-glycoproteins indicates a response to xenobiotic exposure Heat-shock protein 60 and 70</p><p>(Hsp60 and Hsp70) Hsp60 and Hsp70 are molecular chaperonins. Chaperones regulate protein structure and function under normal physiological conditions as well as during and following stress by renaturing denatured proteins into active states in an ATP-dependent manner. Both Hsp60 and Hsp70 are ubiquitous chaperonins found in all phyla of life and are essential components for cellular function, during both normal and stressed conditions. Furthermore, mitochondrial and chloroplastic Hsp60 and Hsp70 homologues work in concert--an essential multi-step pathway for correct conformation of protein structure. Hsp60 and Hsp70 levels increase in response to stress, specifically in response to increased protein synthesis and denaturation Invertebrate small heat-shock proteins (sHsp = total small heat-shock protein isoforms)--aB-crystallin, Hsp22, Hsp23, Hsp26, and Hsp28 share domains of common homology to one another, but have different cellular functions. In cnidarians, as many as 5-6 major sHsp isoforms exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Downs et al., 2000)</ref>. Small Hsps from all phyla share a common motif near the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein, known as the ''heat-shock domain'' or a-crystallin domain. Other areas of these proteins are not homologous and are specific to the sub-family of sHsps. In most cases, the small heat-shock proteins are not present during optimal growing conditions and are only elicited by stress. aB-crystallin is a small heat-shock protein found only in the cytosol of animals, where it protects cytoskeletal elements during stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Derham and Harding, 1999)</ref>. Thus, the presence and concentration of different small heat-shock proteins reflects the physiological status of several metabolic and structural pathways in the cell Chloroplast small heat-shock protein (Chlp sHsp) A member of the small heat-shock protein family found only in plants. This protein functions to protect Photosystem II activity, specifically the oxygen evolving complex, during photooxidative conditions. This protein is not normally present during non-stressed conditions, but is induced by heat stress, high-light stress, UV stress, and during exposure to some herbicides (e.g., atrazine) Ubiquitin</p><p>Ubiquitin is a 76-residue protein found in most phyla of life and used in a process for marking proteins for rapid degradation. Ubiquinated proteins are degraded by proteolytic enzymes known as proteosomes. Proteins, during stress, are targeted for degradation usually because these proteins have undergone an irreversible denaturation. Increases in ubiquitin levels are an indication of increased levels of protein degradation, and hence, increased protein turnover. Consequently, to compensate for decreased functional protein levels due to stress, the cell will increase production of these same proteins. Thus, measurement of levels of ubiquitin is an index of the structural integrity of the protein component of the superstructure of the cell. Increased ubiquitin levels indicates:</p><p>(1) a protein denaturing stress is occurring;</p><p>(2) increased expenditure of energy is required to compensate for this stress-induced protein turnover; and (3) in comparison to baseline data of this parameter for a particular species, may act as an indicator of individual fitness and November 2000. Individual colonies in the Florida Keys were identified and tagged in 1999, while colonies in AlinaÕs Reef were identified and tagged in March 2000. Throughout the year, the same colonies were resampled at each of the sampling time points, with the exception of August and November at AlinaÕs Reef as the result of whole colony mortality. In August and November, new coral colonies were sampled at AlinaÕs reef to compensate for the coral colonies that died. Samples were biopsied using a modified leather punch, and then placed in black film canisters. On deck, water was quickly removed from the film canister and samples transferred to a liquid nitrogen dry shipper. Samples were stored at À8°C until analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Sample preparation, ELISA validation, and ELISA</head><p>Coral samples were ground to a powder using a liquid nitrogen-chilled ceramic pestle and mortar. Samples ($10 mg) of frozen tissue were placed in 1.8 ml microcentrifuge tubes along with 1400 ll of a denaturing buffer consisting of 2% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM EDTA, 0.001 mM sorbi-tol, 7% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (wt/vol), 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (wt/vol), 0.01 mM alpha-tocopherol, 0.005 mM salicylic acid, 0.01 mM AEBSF, 0.04 mM Bestatin, 0.001 E-64, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM benzamidine, 0.01 mM apoprotin, 5 lM a-amino-caproic acid, and 1 lg/100 ul pepstatin A. Samples were heated at 95°C for 3 min, vortexed for 20 s, incubated at 95°C for another 3 min, and then incubated at 25°C for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 • g for 10 min. Supernatant free of a lipid/glycoprotein mucilage matrix was transferred to a new tube, centrifuged at 10,000 • g for 5 min and supernatant free of a lipid/glycoprotein mucilage matrix was again transferred to a new tube and subjected to a protein concentration assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ghosh et al., 1988)</ref>.</p><p>To ensure equal sample loading, 40 lg of total soluble protein of samples from one site and time point were loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel (16 cm), the gel was run until the bromophenol blue dye front was near the bottom of the gel, stained with a Coomassie blue solution (BB R-250) overnight, and then destained for 4 h with multiple washes of destaining solution. Equal loading was determined by visualization and optical density using a Canonscan scanner and analysis performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the US National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). The purpose of this method is to visually validate the protein concentration assay and to ensure that sample artifact has not occurred between the time of sample homogenization and sample analysis.</p><p>One-dimensional SDS-PAGE and western blotting validated the legitimacy of an ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) on this species of coral using a specific antibody <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Downs, 2005)</ref>. Five to 15 micrograms of total soluble protein of coral supernatant was loaded onto a 20-, 16-, or 8-cm SDS-polyacrylamide gel with various concentrations of bis/acrylamide. A Tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) concentration of 1 mM was added to gels loaded with samples to be assayed with antibody to the chloroplast sHsp and the invertebrate sHsp. Tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine is a reductant that can be used in acrylamide gels without interfering with acrylamide polymerization. Proteins can often spontaneously form disulfide bonds in the loading buffer, in the stacker gel, and in the separating gel, causing homomeric or heterometic dimerization. Proteins (e.g., small heat-shock proteins) whose very nature are to dimerize under adverse environmental conditions will readily aggregate under standard SDS-PAGE procedures. Gels were blotted onto PVDF membrane using a wet transfer system. Membrane was blocked in 7% non-fat dry milk, and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h. The blots were washed in tris-buffered saline (TBS)-0.05% Tween (v/v) four times, and incubated in a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody solution for 1 h. Blots were washed four times in TBS, and developed using a chemiluminescent reporter system.</p><p>Once validated, antibodies and samples were optimized for ELISA using an 8 • 6 • 4 factorial design <ref type="bibr">(Crowther, 1999)</ref>. Every ELISA assay must be optimized for the proper concentration of protein loading, antibody titer, sample-to-standard calibration, and handling procedures as a measure of quality control and quality assurance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Downs, 2005)</ref>. A Beckman-Coulter Biomek 2000 using 384-well microplates was used to conduct the ELISA assays.

Samples were assayed in triplicate with intra-specific variation of less than 6% for the whole plate. An eight-point calibrant curve using a calibrant relevant to each antibody was plated in triplicate for each plate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Diagnostic strategy and statistical analysis</head><p>Planned (a priori) and unplanned comparison tests were used, depending on whether the question posed for a specific data set contained fundamental hypotheses, as in the case of a quantitative diagnostic strategy used by the Cellular Diagnostic System <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Schaeffer, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Panzer et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Downs, 2005)</ref>. Cellular Diagnostics posits that changes in cellular integrity and homeostatic responses are fundamental end-points in discriminating whether a xenobiotic or environmental agent is affecting the cell, hence the organism. The terms cellular integrity and homeostatic responses can be partially and stipulatively defined by the behavior of the parameters in the following categories: genomic integrity, protein metabolic condition, xenobiotic response, metabolic integrity, and oxidative-stress effects and response. It should be noted that these definiens of cellular integrity and homeostatic responses are used because they are measurable by the present technology. As the technology evolves, so will the categories and parameters; thus providing a more meaningful explanation for cellular integrity and homeostatic response.</p><p>Each category is defined by a functional process and the physical components constituting that process. For example, protein metabolic condition can be defined, in part, by the protein, RNA, and enzymatic components (sub-systems) that have a role in protein synthesis, protein maturation, and protein degradation. Shifts in these parameters are indicative of a shift in the equilibrium of these sub-systems, as well as the system as a whole. The behavior of each cellular parameter is independently regulated from the behavior of other cellular parameters, but can be affected by the behavior of other systems.</p><p>Parametric statistics were used to test whether cellular parameters differed among sites at the same time point and at different time points. If data were normally distributed and homogeneous, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a = 0.05 was employed. When BartlettÕs test for homoscedasticity or graphical assessment of normality showed variates that did not meet ANOVA assumptions, we substituted a Welch ANOVA <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Sokal and Rohlf, 1995)</ref>. When significant differences were found among treatment means, we used the Tukey-Kramer honestly significant difference (HSD) method as an exact alpha-level test for all differences between means <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Sokal and Rohlf, 1995)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Antibody validation</head><p>Antibodies against cnidarian cellular parameters did not exhibit significant non-specific cross-reactivity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2</ref>, Panels A-E), hence could be validly used in an ELISA format.</p><p>Antibodies against dinoflagellate cellular parameters also did not exhibit significant non-specific cross-reactivity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3, Panels A-G)</ref>. All blots are undoctored, full length documentation of the western blot. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref> and D and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3C</ref> there is an artifact band at the top or bottom of the lane which are shadows from polyacrylamide gel edges, which is sometimes a common artifact of electro-transfer. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>, multiple bands are seen at a discreet migration rate. Glutathione peroxidase alpha is reknown for having multiple homologues. The antibody was raised against a conserved domain that is found in all homologues of GPx alpha, hence these homologues are detected in the blot. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2B</ref>, a doublet band is seen for cnidarian GST. In high resolution gels, this can often be seen as a result of glutathione conjugation to the selenocysteine, thereby changing the GSTs migration rate. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2E</ref>, the doublet band is the result of the expression of Hsp70 homologues, which are differentially regulated <ref type="bibr">(Downs, unpublished data; C. Smith, personal communication)</ref>. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3A</ref>, a doublet band is seen for the chloroplast sHsp, which is the result of a 5-15 amino-acid residue homologue <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Downs et al., 1999)</ref>. Data for ubiquitin is not shown, because a western blot of ubiquitin is a smear, which is the result of single ubiquitin and the single and poly-ubiquitination of histones and proteins slated for degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Downs et al., 2000)</ref>. A band was not detectable in the western blot for the invertebrate sHsp, but this is not unusual since only a severely stressed coral will exhibit this protein at a western blot detectable level <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Downs et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Because of the evolutionary conservation of ubiquitin and MDR, these antibodies detected proteins from both species of the symbiosis in the coral homogenate (data not shown). Therefore, an ELISA measurement using this antibody detects total concentration for these proteins. In MDR, the faster migrating band is the dinoflagellate homologue while the slower migrating band is the cnidarian homologue. This was determined by running cultured Symbiodinium protein next to the coral homogenate using an SDS-PAGE/western blotting protocol (data not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">ELISA results</head><p>ELISA results are divided into the following Environmental Cellular Diagnostic System Categories:</p><p>• Protein Metabolic Condition which includes dinoflagellate Hsp60, dinoflagellate Hsp70, cnidarian Hsp60, cnidarian Hsp70 and Ubiquitin <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4)</ref> GST, cnidarian GST and MDR <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 7)</ref>.</p><p>Subjective observations suggested little or no change in coral cover at sites 1-4 since our previous study in 1999 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Downs et al., 2002a)</ref>. At AlinaÕs Reef, coral coverage appeared unchanged from December 1999 to June 2000. By August, a clearly observable loss in coral cover occurred on the massive Montastraea heads at this site. Several coral heads that spanned more than 1 m in length were completely lost. There was significant coverage of brown algae on the dead coral, and it was therefore not possible to repeatedly sample one entire coral colony in August, and another one by November October.</p><p>The most striking biomarker pattern was exhibited by corals from AlinaÕs Reef in March 2000. Parameters of protein metabolic condition suggested that a massive insult was occurring, and that the insult not only resulted in increased protein denaturation, but a considerable level of damage to functioning enzymes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 4, Table 1</ref>). Cnidarian and dinoflagellate Hsp70s and Hsp60s at Ali-naÕs Reef in March were significantly higher than Sites 1-4 at any time point (one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>. Ubiquitin at AlinaÕs Reef in March was considerably higher than almost all the sites at any time (oneway ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001). Two conclusions that can be inferred from this data are (1) that the stressor was affecting only AlinaÕs Reef and (2) that the stressor was also adversely affecting both Cnidarian and algal compartments of the coral symbiosis. Cnidarian and dinoflagellate Hsp70 and cnidarian Hsp60 remained high through November (one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05). Levels of dinoflagellate Hsp60 were no longer significantly elevated in August (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.01), suggesting that at least organellar protein metabolism was returning to basal levels. Increased cnidarian Hsp60 suggests that mitochondrial function in the host remained perturbed through November.</p><p>Small heat-shock proteins protect various metabolic pathways and cellular function and usually are only present when these systems are experiencing a significant level of damage or dysfunction <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. The chloroplast sHsp is an evolutionarily conserved protein found only in the chloroplast of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms and protects Photosystem II of the photosynthetic electron-transport chain during stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heckathorn et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Downs et al., 1999)</ref>. Basal levels of this protein through the year in corals from sites 1-4 near Molasses Reef averaged 0.075 EU/ng TSP <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig.  5</ref>). Levels of this protein at AlinaÕs Reef in March were over twice this (Welch ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001), indicating that PSII was severely stressed, if not damaged. Chloroplast sHsp levels then decreased to basal levels in June and remained there for the remainder of the year. Cnidarian sHsps had a similar pattern <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5)</ref>, with cnidarian sHsp levels at AlinaÕs Reef in March almost double the levels at the other sites through the year (Welch ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001), but then decreasing significantly in June to levels comparable to seen at the other sites. The sHsp22 is localized to the mitochondria in cnidarians and other invertebrates and is thought to protect aspects of respiration, specifically oxidative phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Morrow et al., 2000)</ref>. These data suggest that the stressor(s) affected electron-transport of major metabolic pathways and destabilized cnidarian mitochondrial function for the remainder of the year.</p><p>Induction of both the chloroplast sHsp and the invertebrate sHsps suggests that oxidative damage may be occurring in both symbionts. To determine if antioxidant defenses of both species were elevated, we examined superoxide dismutases and glutathione peroxidases. Cnidarian MnSOD for corals sampled at Alinas Reef was significantly elevated throughout the year compared to sites 1-4 at all time points, but especially in March (Welch ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref>). The expression pattern of dinoflagellate MnSOD reflected the pattern of cnidarian MnSOD, but its accumulation was even more pronounced in AlinaÕs Reef, compared to the other sites at any of the time points (Welch ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001). Elevation of both MnSODs suggests that the unknown stressor is affecting the mitochondria in both species. Both cnidarian and dinoflagellate GPx levels were significantly increased in March at AlinaÕs Reef (ANOVA, p &gt; 0.001) but, as in the case of the MnSODs, decreased in accumulation in June through November, although these were still higher than GPx levels at Sites 1-4 (p &lt; 0.001), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 6</ref>. This increase of the major enzymatic anti-oxidant defenses suggests indicates that AlinaÕs Reef was responding to an oxidative stress.</p><p>Combined results for parameters of Protein Metabolic Condition, small Hsps, and oxidative stress defense argue that AlinaÕs Reef was experiencing a significant stress that was severely damaging proteins and threatening nominal metabolic equilibrium. Assays that examine mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial electron transport, cytoskeletal integrity, and protein, lipid, and DNA oxidation would better refine the mechanism of cellular disruption that occurred at AlinaÕs Reef. Some of these assays could be done in the field on the same day of collection, enhancing the ability of managers/scientists to identify and possibly mitigate the stressor.</p><p>The significant effect of the unknown stressor on both biomarker responses and coral cover at AlinaÕs Reef strongly argues that the stressor is localized; at least localized to or around a region that includes AlinaÕs Reef, but not Sites 1-4. Based on the proximity of Ali-naÕs Reef to a number of anthropogenic activities (e.g. nuclear power plant, South Florida Water Management Canals, agricultural runoff, Dade County Landfill, City of Miami) we hypothesised that the localized stressor  may be a chemical xenobiotic. To test this hypothesis, we examined three cellular parameters that would be significantly modulated by a xenobiotic: cnidarian GST, dinoflagellate GST, and the P-glycoprotein 180 homologue (multixenobiotic resistance protein, MXR-MDR), from both species. Cnidarian GST levels were significantly elevated in March at AlinaÕs Reef (Welch ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001), and continued to be significantly elevated (Welch ANOVA, p &lt; 0.01), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>. Dinoflagellate GST was elevated at AlinaÕs Reef in March, as well as the rest of the year, but this elevation was not as pronounced as the cnidarian GST (Welch ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>. Multixenobiotic resistance protein, MXR-MDR, is an ABC cassette protein that lowers the intracellular concentration of toxic compounds below their level of toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bard, 2000)</ref>. Increase of this protein is usually only in response to an organic xenobiotic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bard, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sauna et al., 2001</ref>). Unfortunately, this antibody binds both the cnidarian and dinoflagellate isoforms, hence results are a composite of MDR expression in both. MDR levels were significantly elevated in March at AlinaÕs Reef above all other sites at all time  points (Welch ANOVA, p &lt; 0.001), <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 7</ref>. MDR levels at AlinaÕs Reef decreased in June and were not significantly different than MDR levels Sites 1-4 throughout the rest of the year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Levels of almost all of the cellular diagnostic markers for corals sampled at Sites 1-4 near Molasses Reef were not significantly different from one another during any of the sampling time points (ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer HSD test, p &gt; 0.05). The significant difference in coral biomarker levels between AlinaÕs Reef and Sites 1-4, coupled with field observations, suggests that the coral decline observed in the Upper Keys may be related to local factors rather than large climatic actions (e.g. El Nino). Though we are able to ascertain that the localized stressor induces an oxidative stress, is disruptive to mitochondrial ÔnominalÕ equilibrium, and elicits a strong xenobiotic detoxification response, the exact identification of the stressor remains unknown. The inability to more accurately identify the stressor could be alleviated by increasing the scope of the cellular biomarkers in corals, and by contaminant/chemistry analysis. For example, assays for cnidarian metallothioneins, cnidarian methyl arsenic reductases, dinoflagellate sulfate permease, dinoflagellate nitrate reductase, and dinoflagellate calcium-dependent alkaline phosphatase could be developed to aid in deducing the identity profile of the stressor(s). Alternatively, assays for chemical compound adducts with DNA or protein could be developed to not only identify the agent, but also establish that it is having a direct biological effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Downs et al., 2002b)</ref>. Environmental chemistry analysis, along with contaminant analysis (e.g., endosulfan, atrazine, mercury, etc.), would tremendously increase the power in determining stressor identity from among a number of potential suspects. Laboratory toxicological studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Downs et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Downs, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hawkridge et al., 2005)</ref> may provide further corroborating evidence as to the identity of the putative stressor, especially since the coral samples have been archived and can be analyzed with new assays as they are developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We have provided evidence that coral decline in the Florida Keys may, in part, be rooted with local factors and, at least for AlinaÕs Reef, be associated with xenobiotic exposure. Further development of cellular diagnostics for coral health assessment and their integration with other disciplines represents a powerful tool for (a) providing resource managers valuable information as to the health condition of specific coral reefs and (b) providing evidence concerning the identity of putative stressors, allowing the development of defensable mitigation strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Downs et al., 2005)</ref>. The approach also potentially allows the fate of coral reefs to be forecasted in light of stress events. In this regard, good prognostic markers for morbidity/mortality are those that are usually directly associated with cellular damage. Protein carbonyl, lipid peroxidation products, and DNA damage products have been demonstrated as good prognostic indicators for corals, while stress defense proteins and solutes have demonstrated value as indicators of stress susceptibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Downs et al., 2002a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fauth et al., 2003)</ref>.

			<abstract>
				<p>Coral reefs rely upon the highly optimized coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis, making them sensitive to environmental change and susceptible to anthropogenic stress. Coral bleaching is predominantly attributed to photo-oxidative stress, yet nutrient availability and metabolism underpin the stability of symbioses. Recent studies link symbiont proliferation under nutrient enrichment to bleaching; however, the interactions between nutrients and symbiotic stability are nuanced. Here, we demonstrate how bleaching is regulated by the forms and ratios of available nutrients and their impacts on autotrophic carbon metabolism, rather than algal symbiont growth. By extension, historical nutrient conditions mediate hostsymbiont compatibility and bleaching tolerance over proximate and evolutionary timescales. Renewed investigations into the coral nutrient metabolism will be required to truly elucidate the cellular mechanisms leading to coral bleaching. Coral Reefs under Anthropogenic Stress Coral reef ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity and productivity which provide vital and extensive ecosystem services [1-3]. However, these values of coral reefs are under threat due to global mass bleaching events triggered by ocean warming [4]. Coral bleaching (see Glossary) is a stress response to elevated heat and light levels, where corals lose their algal symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) [5,6]. Corals acquire most of their energy through photosynthates translocated by the algal symbionts [7], and the loss of this energy source for long periods can result in starvation and mortality [5]. Bleaching mortality can lead to reductions in coral cover, species and genetic diversity, which shifts reefs away from a coral-dominated state and impedes ecosystem resilience [8,9]. Although some reefs remain resilient, and there exists potential to adapt to warming oceans through natural means [10] and human interventions [11], strong reductions in anthropogenic carbon emissions are ultimately required to ensure the persistence of coral reefs. Coral reefs are also impacted by local stressors, which reduce water quality and have the potential to interact with warming to increase coral bleaching susceptibility [12]. Changes in land use adjacent to reefs can result in primary nutrient enrichment that may be further altered through biological and physical processes [12]; organisms across a range of trophic levels can secondarily modify the nutrient environment [12,13], and localized fishing results in the removal of significant nutrient subsidies from reefs [14]. Climate change also influences marine biogeochemistry at a global scale, where increased storm activity intensifies enrichment events through riverine flux and water column mixing [12,15,16]. In contrast, ocean warming increases water column stratification which reduces nutrient availability [12,17]. Synergistically, global and local drivers and subsequent biological processes not only impact nutrient levels on coral reefs but also change the forms and ratios of nutrients, making nutrient limitation possible [12]. Recent experiments suggest Highlights Mass coral bleaching is occurring at an unprecedented rate due to anthropogenic ocean warming, and it represents the greatest threat to coral reef ecosystems globally. Coral bleaching is predominantly attributed to photo-oxidative stress under elevated temperature and light, but recent experiments have unveiled nutritional mechanisms that can regulate bleaching. Bleaching may result when the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis shifts from a mutualistic to a parasitic relationship under thermal stress. Nutrient availability, specifically the forms and ratios of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, mediates algal symbiont parasitism. Stable metabolic compatibility between the coral host and algal symbiont can ameliorate bleaching and increase resilience to environmental stress.</p>

Tight nutrient recycling within the symbiosis provides the algal symbionts with respiratory CO and nitrogenous waste products, and in exchange the coral host receives photosynthetically fixed carbon <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Additionally, the algal symbionts efficiently assimilate dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus into the holobiont <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Corals also acquire nutrients through heterotrophic feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and their microbiome through translocation and digestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The relative modes of nutrient acquisition depend on the individual capabilities of each holobiont member, for example nitrogen fixation by diazotrophs may compensate for limited inorganic or heterotrophic nitrogen uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, and heterotrophy may compensate for reduced autotrophic capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Metabolic compatibility between individual coral hosts and their algal symbiont communities likely underpins holobiont performance and their tolerance to environmental stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28]</ref>. But when corals bleach, they are depleted of their major nutrient source and their chances of recovery are partly determined by their ability to restore algal symbiont autotrophy or compensate through heterotrophic nutrient acquisition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Additionally, nutrient acquisition and loss through the microbiome changes when corals bleach <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. While corals use heterotrophically acquired nutrients to help maintain and recover their algal symbiont populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, the relative contribution of inorganic nutrient sources to coral autotrophic recovery is not well understood.</p><p>At the cellular level, the contemporary and widely accepted understanding of coral bleaching is one triggered by temperature and light-induced photodamage to the algal symbionts, leading to oxidative stress in both partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. However, recent studies have shown coral bleaching in the absence of heat, light, and/or oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, highlighting the existence of alternative pathways to coral bleaching (Box 1). Importantly, there is now mounting evidence for the role of nutritional mechanisms in the response of corals to thermal stress and the initiation of bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Therefore, the internal nutrient metabolism and external nutrient environment should be considered, in addition to photo-oxidative stress, when predicting the response of corals to thermal stress.</p><p>The role of nutrients in the early stages of coral bleaching has long been hypothesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, but it was Wooldridge <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> who first posited that temperature increases could shift the algal symbiont populations from mutualism to parasitism. At elevated temperatures, the relative contribution of the symbionts to the carbon metabolism of the symbiosis is hypothesized to decrease <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, due to reduced photosynthate translocation and/or increased host metabolism. Additionally, the symbiont's heat/light protection mechanisms, including super-quenching, could halt carbon fixation without oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Under these scenarios, the coral host is forced to catabolize its own carbon reserves to maintain CO 2 and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) delivery for symbiont photosynthesis. Once these stores diminish, photosynthetic dysfunction ensues and triggers coral bleaching through the photo-oxidative pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.

Therefore, the nutritional status of corals, driven by external conditions and internal metabolism, can have a profound influence on bleaching susceptibility.</p></div>

Coral bleaching is contemporarily understood to result from photo-oxidative damage to both corals hosts and their algal symbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. More specifically, increased temperatures render the algal symbionts susceptible to incoming light, resulting in photodamage and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can cause cellular damage to both host and symbiont tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. However, recent studies have shown that coral bleaching can also occur without the characteristic photo-oxidative stress response <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Tolleter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> observed that thermal bleaching of corals and the coral model Aiptasia can occur in the dark, independent of ROS.

Nielsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> later found that bleaching independent of ROS can also occur under light. Although ROS were produced in the symbiont, they were not released to the host tissues and no attributable physiological effects were detected in either host or symbiont <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, corroborating field observations that coral superoxide production is unrelated to bleaching status <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>. Furthermore, corals can expel healthy symbiont populations during thermal stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref>, highlighting that bleaching does not require photo-oxidative stress and could instead result from a need to eject dividing symbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>.</p><p>Coral bleaching can also occur solely from the disruption of the coral nutrient metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.

Carbon metabolism and the health of the coral-Symbiodiniaceae endosymbiosis under different inorganic nutrient scenarios. (A) Oligotrophic conditions constrain Symbiodiniaceae growth which stimulates carbon translocation to the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. The translocation of photosynthates as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) facilitates the reverse translocation of inorganic carbon (CO 2 ) and is hypothesized to be integral to the stability of the symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. (B) Moderate enrichments of ammonium (NH + ) and/or phosphate (PO 3-) can increase Symbiodiniaceae abundance and promote photosynthetic health, enhancing total carbon translocation and coral health <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. (C) High dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphate enrichments stimulate rapid Symbiodiniaceae population growth, resulting in competition for resources, which lowers photosynthetic performance and carbon translocation per cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. (D) Nitrate (NO 3 -) enrichment and/or phosphate limitation can damage photosynthesis which greatly reduces total carbon translocation and coral health <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. Nutrient conditions which weaken the symbiosis (C,D) can be expected to act synergistically with thermal stress to further reduce translocation and induce bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. Conversely, nutrient conditions which strengthen the symbiosis (B) may ameliorate reductions in translocation to increase coral thermal tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>.</p><p>which overwhelms the antioxidant capabilities of a biological organism. bleaching susceptibility without prior enlargement of symbiont density <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. It is important to note that nitrogen enrichments may not result in increased algal symbiont cell division per se <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>, but rather changes to the stable density of symbiont populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Therefore, coral holobionts could simply reach a new and healthy equilibrium that balances nutrient availability, symbiont growth, and carbon translocation under nutrient enrichment.</p><p>The opposing impacts of ammonium and nitrate on coral thermal tolerance are better explained by their relative effects on holobiont carbon metabolism and oxidative stress. Ammonium stimulates photosynthesis and allows the algal symbionts to maintain photoprotective pigmentation and carbon translocation to the host under thermal stress ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. In contrast, increased nitrate assimilation, due to external enrichment and/or thermal stress, encourages symbiont parasitism ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1D</ref>), where the algal symbionts pass the energetic costs of nitrate utilization onto the coral host <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>. Therefore, nitrogen enrichment mediates coral bleaching through the carbon limitation model. However, this is realized through direct impacts on photosynthesis rather than symbiont growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symbiodiniaceae Density and Coral Thermal Tolerance</head><p>An extension to the carbon limitation bleaching model is that very dense algal symbiont populations become parasitic due to intercellular competition and thereby reduce coral thermal tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. In this case, excess nutrients which enlarge algal symbiont populations to levels at which other resources (e.g., CO 2 and light availability) limit photosynthetic output are linked to parasitism <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Indeed, some studies correlate algal symbiont density with coral bleaching susceptibility under ambient nutrient conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, citing increased oxidative stress. However, this is contradicted by others, who suggest that coral holobiont genetic identity is more important, or that self-shading within dense algal symbiont populations protects against photo-oxidative damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>. The impact of symbiont abundance on coral bleaching susceptibility therefore remains difficult to resolve.</p><p>The relationship between algal symbiont abundance and the coral carbon metabolism may better explain the observed impacts on thermal tolerance. Symbiont densities above an optimal range (~1-3 × 10 6 cells cm -2 depending on coral host species) have the potential to reduce carbon availability within the coral holobiont <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. Balanced nutrient enrichments (nitrogen plus phosphorus) lead to the highest algal symbiont densities but can also reduce carbon translocation per symbiont cell ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. However, total carbon translocation to the host is unaffected <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>, indicating that dense populations remain mutualistic. In general, studies which combine nitrate and phosphate enrichments with elevated temperature suggest that balanced nutrient enrichments have little impact on coral thermal tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, although exceptions can occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. Conversely, corals that are depleted in both nutrients take on a relatively bleached appearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> and reduced thermal tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Based on these studies, there is equivocal evidence that dense algal symbiont populations increase the susceptibility of corals to thermal stress. No single study thus far has simultaneously linked coral carbon metabolism and thermal tolerance with intraspecific variation in symbiont population size, and/or exposure to balanced nutrient enrichment. This leaves major gaps in our understanding of how algal symbiont density relates to thermal tolerance and should be a focus for future research.</p></div>

Heterotrophic food sources contain carbon, in addition to providing nitrogen and phosphorus <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which prevents carbon limitation under thermal stress and enhances coral bleaching resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92]</ref>. However, heterotrophic feeding is not always beneficial, particularly under stressful inorganic nutrient conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref> or when food is of poor quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>.

These findings are particularly relevant given that corals on productive nearshore reefs rely more on heterotrophic feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>, due to increased organic nutrient availability and/or nutrient stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nutrient Availability and the Coral Microbiome</head><p>The coral microbiome (specifically bacteria and archaea) has been implicated in the cycling of essential nutrients within the coral holobiont and may therefore play a role in mediating coral-Symbiodiniaceae metabolic interactions and holobiont responses to environmental stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, the microbial metabolic pathways integrated with the coral host and their algal symbionts remain poorly characterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Nitrogen fixation is perhaps the best characterized microbial metabolic function that supports the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Corals harbour a diverse community of diazotrophs <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref>, and nitrogen fixation has been observed in a range of coral species <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102]</ref> to potentially provide nitrogen to both the host and algal symbiont tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Importantly, nitrogen fixation is influenced by environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103]</ref> and has been suggested to both support and hinder the stability of the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Nitrogen fixation is known to increase in warm summer conditions, when both external nutrient availability and algal symbiont populations are low, and putatively allows the coral holobiont to maintain its productivity through these stressful conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">105]</ref> much like ammonium enrichment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>. However, other studies have linked elevated nitrogen fixation to thermal stress and bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103]</ref>. The activity of nitrogen fixers in corals is known to be stimulated by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) enrichment, which increases N:P ratios within the coral holobiont and can lead to bleaching through carbon limitation and photo-oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. In the same way, summer conditions on coral reefs coupled with increased nitrogen fixation could represent a 'perfect storm' for coral bleaching, where the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis becomes overwhelmed by a combination of high temperatures, elevated irradiance, and increased N:P ratios. Furthermore, diazotrophs may act as an additional sink of carbon and bypass the host's ability to restrict external nitrogen supply to the algal symbionts, thereby enhancing the likelihood of coral bleaching. Microbial nitrogen fixation therefore represents a highly dynamic pathway by which other coral holobiont members can acquire nitrogen; however, the consequences of this differ depending on the environmental context.</p><p>Changes to environmental nutrient conditions may impact the coral microbiome, manifesting as microbial dysbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref> and resulting in coral disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. For example, field and laboratory studies have linked nutrient enrichment to coral disease, where enrichments of ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate induced and/or enhanced a range of coral diseases including black band disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, yellow band disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>, and dark spot syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. In addition, these combined nutrient enrichments triggered the production of herpes-like viruses in Porites compressa <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>, while both DOC and nutrient enrichments were shown to shift the microbiome towards a pathogenic state <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. However, other studies have shown that coral microbiome structure does not consistently respond to nitrate and/or phosphate enrichment <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>, nor to DOC or urea enrichment <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. These latter experiments suggest that coral microbiomes can either shift into unique and random dysbiotic states <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>, or remain inflexible <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> under nutrient stress. Therefore, although nutrient enrichment can be broadly associated with coral dysbiosis and disease, relationships with specific nutrient forms are unclear and should be a focus for future study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nutrient Availability and Coral Bleaching Recovery</head><p>It is well established that particulate nutrients ingested by the coral host promote recovery following thermal bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. However, information regarding the comparative impacts of inorganic nutrients is lacking. Heterotrophic feeding can promote recovery from bleaching by alleviating coral carbon limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92]</ref>, whereas bioenergetic modelling suggests that inorganic nitrogen enrichment has an opposite, detrimental effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>.</p><p>Empirical studies testing inorganic nutrient impacts on corals following thermal stress are few in number, but nitrate enrichment can either trigger the rapid growth of photodamaged algal symbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">113]</ref> or prolong coral bleaching leading to increased mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref>. Both responses are well explained by a bioenergetic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Firstly, dense algal symbiont communities can form naturally in corals post-bleaching, owing to a sudden increase in resources per symbiont cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. Secondly, the growing algal symbiont population retains photosynthates, delaying recovery of the coral host <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. External nitrogen enrichment could therefore be expected to prolong the carbon-limited status of a bleached coral holobiont and increase the risk of mortality through starvation. However, to date, the impacts of inorganic nutrient availability on bleaching recovery have only been tested in experiments that enrich corals throughout entire thermal stress periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">113]</ref>. To fully understand the nutritional processes involved in coral bleaching recovery, future experiments should apply nutrient manipulations following thermal bleaching, rather than before or during bleaching, to explicitly separate pre-and post-bleaching nutrient impacts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inorganic Nutrient Metabolism Underpins Coral Stress Tolerance</head><p>Evolutionary theory predicts that the stability of nutritional symbioses is controlled by finely balanced conflict mediation between partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>.

Genetic and phenotypic variation underpins the environmental stress tolerance of coral holobionts and may manifest in processes such as the control of inorganic nutrient metabolism, which mediates whether it is the coral host or the algal symbionts that benefits from autotrophic carbon fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">115]</ref>.</p><p>The processes that regulate the supply of nutrients to the algal symbionts and the subsequent translocation of carbon are still poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.

Combined transcriptome-metabolome analyses in Exaiptasia diaphana anemones (common name Aiptasia) also suggest that coral hosts may use photosynthates to sequester their own ammonium wastes into amino acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Both of these actions may represent hostderived mechanisms that act to maintain the algal symbionts in a nitrogen-limited state and, in turn, prevent carbon limitation of the holobiont. However, the algal symbionts have evolved to counteract nitrogen limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>, rendering corals susceptible to symbiont parasitism under nitrate enrichment and thermal stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>. Despite this, interspecific differences in the nutrient acquisition and utilization of the symbionts offer a potential avenue to holobiont stress tolerance <ref type="bibr">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">117]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolic Compatibility between Coral and Symbiodiniaceae Lineages</head><p>Coral holobionts containing high-performance 'generalist' algal symbionts (e.g., Cladocopium goreaui) often outperform more 'specialized' stress-tolerant symbionts (e.g., Durusdinium trenchii) in terms of key traits such as photosynthesis and host growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref>.

These observations may be related to differences in nutrient metabolism, where thermally tolerant types upregulate their nitrate intake to maintain carbon translocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Hence, thermally tolerant algal symbiont species may convey resistance to nutrient and/or thermal stress, whereas corals hosting other algal species become carbon-limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>. Furthermore, increased nitrogen availability per symbiont following bleaching can promote recovery of corals with stress-tolerant types <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. It is possible that thermally tolerant species direct additional nitrogen towards carbon translocation, as their growth rates are low and stable across environmental conditions compared with other species <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>, which may proliferate and subsequently reduce overall holobiont health <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. Therefore, the identity of the algal symbionts appears to alter holobiont tolerance to nutrient and thermal stress through differences in inorganic nutrient metabolism, although this remains to be fully determined.</p><p>Evidence from Aiptasia suggests that both host and algal symbiont identity mediate inorganic nutrient metabolism and thermal tolerance. The photosynthetic response of Aiptasia to thermal stress depends on both the host strain and algal symbiont genus: where heterologous ('novel') holobionts outperform those that are homologous ('normal') at elevated temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>. Similar host-symbiont interactions can occur in corals, where host species impacts the relative thermal tolerance of holobionts containing different, yet homologous, algal symbiont genera <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>. At the nutritional level, carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation by the algal symbionts in Aiptasia have been shown to depend solely on symbiont identity, whereas host benefits through carbon translocation are codependent on host genotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In this case, the algal symbionts retained a constant amount of fixed nutrients regardless of their host <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In general, homologous holobionts outperform heterologous holobionts as evidenced by reduced carbon translocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref> and growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref> in heterologous symbioses. Furthermore, novel symbionts may sustain themselves by manipulating host nitrogen cycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>. Although the later observations appear to contradict earlier findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>, it remains to be seen how nutrient and thermal stress impact host-symbiont interactions in nutrient metabolism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phenotypic Plasticity in Nutrient Metabolism</head><p>The ability of the coral holobiont to activate mechanisms which maintain and enhance metabolic compatibility may be partly determined by adaptation or acclimation to their environment. For example, algal symbionts in warm-acclimated coral holobionts assimilate less nitrogen and translocate more carbon than their ambient-acclimated counterparts upon acute exposure to thermal stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Although both sets of coral holobionts were physiologically unaffected by thermal stress in this experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, other studies have found that acclimation to elevated and variable temperatures prior to acute thermal stress reduces the severity of coral bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>. Therefore, as part of, or in addition to observed genetic mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[136]</ref>, temperature acclimation may help coral hosts to resist bleaching by invoking metabolic processes which act to maintain their symbionts in a mutualistic state.</p><p>Prior exposure to different water quality environments may provide another avenue for acclimation. Inshore reefs are often resistant to bleaching, despite their exposure to elevated and variable nutrient and temperature conditions relative to offshore reefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[137]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>. In the Florida Keys, the growth of inshore corals is reduced upon transplantation to new off-or along-shore environments, suggesting that their thermal tolerance is linked to fine-scale nutritional specialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>. In contrast, the evolved thermal tolerance of corals in oligotrophic regions, such as the Red Sea, may be highly sensitive to even minor increases in nutrient availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">144]</ref>. Combined, these results suggest that the historical nutrient conditions (over proximate and evolutionarily timescales) can prime coral hosts for the nutritional disruption that occurs during acute stress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding Remarks</head><p>The coral bleaching process is currently understood mainly through photo-oxidative pathways, although recent evidence indicates that nutritional mechanisms are involved. The coral-Symbiodiniaceae relationship is primarily a trophic mutualism and therefore the stability of this symbiosis is dependent on the balance and exchange of nutrients in response to environmental conditions. In this review, we have integrated novel experimental evidence to show how nutrient availability and metabolism can mediate coral bleaching with and without photooxidative stress. Nutrient availability has previously been postulated to influence bleaching susceptibility through increasing symbiont growth rates; however, we demonstrate here that bleaching is better attributed to changes to autotrophic carbon metabolism, which depend on nutrient form and ratio. Furthermore, historical nutrient conditions may influence hostsymbiont metabolic capability and therefore bleaching susceptibility. Future experiments should determine how nutrient and temperature conditions alter the metabolic cooperation and stability of distinct coral-Symbiodiniaceae combinations (see Outstanding Questions). An added focus should also be placed on understanding how inorganic nutrients mediate the re-establishment of the coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis following bleaching. Nutrient metabolism within the coral holobiont still remains poorly characterized beyond the identification of putative nutritional pathways, and therefore the specific metabolic pathways which destabilize the symbiosis should be elucidated by manipulating the genes which encode enzymes and transporters involved in nutrient cycling. To truly understand the cellular mechanisms leading to coral bleaching, a renewed focus must be placed upon the nutrient metabolism of the coral holobiont.</p></div>

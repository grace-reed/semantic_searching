			<abstract>
				<p>Copper is a common marine pollutant yet its effects on symbiotic cnidarians are largely understudied. To further understand the impact of elevated copper concentrations on marine symbiotic organisms, toxicity tests were conducted using the model sea anemone, Aiptasia pallida, with and without its zooxanthellae symbiont. Symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida were exposed to sublethal copper concentrations (0, 5, 15, and 50 µg/L) for 7 d and copper accumulation, behavior, and the activity of the oxidative stress enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were measured. Additionally, acute 96-h toxicity tests were conducted to determine LC values of the organisms after copper exposure. Both symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida rapidly accumulated copper in a time and dose dependent manner. However, higher copper concentrations accumulated in the aposymbiotic as compared to the symbiotic A. pallida. In response to the highest two copper exposures (15 and 50 µg/L) symbiotic A. pallida upregulated CAT activity to combat the damaging effects of hydrogen peroxide. Contrary to these results, SOD activity significantly decreased during the highest copper exposure, when compared to controls. CAT activity was not detected and SOD was substantially (N10 fold) reduced in aposymbiotic A. pallida, suggesting that the zooxanthellae are associated with the oxidative stress response. Copper exposure as low as 5 µg/L caused tentacle retraction and increased mucus production in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones. The LC values for symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida exposed to copper for 96 h were 148 µg/L (95% confidence interval= 126.4, 173.8) and 206 µg/L (95% confidence interval=175.2, 242.2), respectively. Understanding the varying responses of symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida to copper stress may advance our comprehension of the functional roles of zooxanthellae and host. Although the mechanism of copper toxicity has not been fully elucidated, it is clear that A. pallida accumulate copper and are sensitive, as effects were detected at environmentally relevant copper concentrations. Likewise, A. pallida may be useful in biomonitoring copper polluted environments. Published by Elsevier Inc.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Copper is a common pollutant found in marine ecosystems. Although copper is a trace mineral required by all organisms, it can be toxic in excess concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bryan and Hummerstone, 1971)</ref>. Copper enters marine systems through runoff from rivers adjacent to heavy metal mining areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bryan, 1974)</ref>; through sewage treatment discharge, industrial effluent, anti-fouling paints and refineries <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guzmán and Jiménez, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jones, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mitchelmore et al., 2003)</ref>. These methods of pollution have a negative impact on coastal ecosystems and the various trophic levels contained within them.</p><p>One such coastal inhabitant, the sea anemone, Aiptasia pallida, is a native species of the southeastern United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kaplan, 1988)</ref>. These symbiotic cnidarians reside on rocks, mangrove roots, coral, and other hard substrates in near shore, shallow coastal waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kaplan, 1988)</ref>. Due to their close proximity to anthropogenic inputs, A. pallida may be a bioindicator of copper pollution. Healthy A. pallida are golden-brown in color due to their zooxanthellae (dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium), which live in symbiosis with A. pallida <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cook et al., 1988)</ref>. Zooxanthellae provide the anemone with photosynthate via carbon fixation pathways. In return, A. pallida, provide the zooxanthellae with nutrients (nitrogenous waste and CO 2 ) and protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cook et al., 1988)</ref>. When this host-symbiont relationship becomes challenged by any number of environmental stressors, loss of the symbiont "bleaching" may occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brown, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Tissue copper accumulation has been reported in both corals and anemones after copper exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mitchelmore et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mitchelmore et al., , 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">Bielmyer et al., in press</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Harland and Nganro (1990)</ref> suggested that the pattern of copper accumulation in the tissues of symbiotic cnidarians may be influenced by the presence of the symbiont. These researchers showed that copper accumulation in the symbiotic sea anemone, Anemonia viridis, was not directly reflective of the copper concentrations in the environment, suggesting that detoxification and excretion mechanisms were used to combat increasing copper concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Harland and Nganro, 1990)</ref>. They suggested that copper accumulated to a greater extent in the zooxanthellae than host tissue and in a final detoxification attempt the anemone released their symbiotic algae to reduce internal copper concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Harland and Nganro, 1990)</ref>. The concept of zooxanthellae expulsion as a mechanism of metal detoxification has been suggested by several researchers, since zooxanthellae have been found to accumulate heavy metals to a larger extent and be more tolerant than their symbiotic hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Peters et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jones, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Although symbiotic cnidarians have been shown to accumulate copper, mechanisms of copper toxicity still remain unclear; however, recent studies have provided new data on copper and cadmium toxicity to scleractinian corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mitchelmore et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bielmyer et al., in press</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mitchelmore et al. (2007)</ref> reported copper and cadmium accumulation in both algal and animal tissue of the coral Pocillopora damicornis as well as a significant induction of the antioxidant, glutathione after exposure to either copper or cadmium. Copper accumulation in both algal and coral animal tissues, reduced zooxanthellae electron transport, reduced carbonic anhydrase activity, and reduced growth were reported in three species of scleractinian corals after five weeks of 4-20 μg/L copper exposure; however, the extent of the effects were species specific <ref type="bibr">(Bielmyer et al., in press</ref>). The effect of ambient copper on anemones, in particular, is an understudied area of research; however, oxidative stress and reduced zooxanthellae density have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mitchelmore et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In many aquatic organisms, the accumulation of copper is typically associated with oxidative stress and subsequent macromolecular damage. The principle mechanism of copper toxicity involves the Haber-Weiss (Fenton) reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gledhill et al., 1997)</ref>. The oxidation of copper (I) in the Fenton reaction drives the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxide and hydroxyl radical <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Klaassen, 1996)</ref>. Copper can also react with superoxide anion to produce oxygen radicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Craig et al., 2007)</ref>. In times of increased abiotic stress, electron transport mechanisms (i.e., photosystems and mitochondrial transport chains) become less efficient. In turn, free electrons are more likely to interact with diatomic molecular oxygen ultimately resulting in a series of reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Due to photosynthesis, symbiotic anemones are subjected to very high levels of oxygen during the day and at night they experience a hypoxic internal environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Plantivaux et al., 2004)</ref>. This continuous transition between extreme oxygen environments can result in the increased production of ROS <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dykens et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nii and Muscatine, 1997)</ref>. ROS can denature proteins, mutate DNA, and cause lipid peroxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Klaassen, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Richier et al., 2005)</ref>. To neutralize the potentially harmful effects of ROS, anemones produce enzymes such as SOD and CAT. SOD catalyzes the conversion of superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen; whereas CAT catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.</p><p>A. pallida are ideally suited for these toxicological studies because they are amenable to laboratory conditions, they are abundant and easy to collect, they reproduce quickly, especially compared to other symbiotic cnidarians such as corals, and they are found in near shore environments where copper contamination may be problematic. Conducting experiments with A. pallida at different symbiotic states may also contribute more knowledge about the role of the symbiont in copper accumulation, toxicity, and detoxification. The objectives of this study were to determine the sensitivity of the anemone, A. pallida, to acute copper exposure and to measure tissue copper accumulation and sublethal effects of copper exposure over a 7-d period in the symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Animal holding</head><p>A. pallida used in the acute lethality experiments were collected from Whitney Laboratory (St. Augustine, FL, USA). The anemones were held in 10 gallon tanks filled with filtered (0.22 µm) seawater (SW; Whitney Laboratory) and maintained under constant filtration and aeration. Anemones (A. pallida) used in the 7-d sublethal experiments were obtained from the University of Miami (Key Biscayne, FL, USA) and acclimated in 10 gallon tanks filled with filtered (0.22 µm) SW for at least a month prior to testing.</p><p>Salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature were measured weekly using a YSI ® Meter (YSI, OH, USA). Ammonia, nitrate and nitrite levels were measured weekly using API ® Saltwater Master Test Kit (Aquarium Pharmaceuticals, PA, USA). Water quality in the holding system was maintained at an average salinity of 35 g/L (±1.3, mean ± SD), DO of 6.8 mg/L (±0.2), temperature of 21 ºC (±1.8), total ammonia-N concentration of 0.1 mg/L (±0.2), nitrate-N concentration of 0.5 mg/L (±1.4), and nitrite-N concentration of 0.3 mg/L (±1.6). The anemones were fed brine shrimp (Artemia sp.) daily. Symbiotic A. pallida were maintained under cool white fluorescent lighting (12 h light:12 h dark). Aposymbiotic anemones were obtained by placing symbiotic specimens in the dark for 3 months. The tanks housing the aposymbiotic A. pallida were completely covered so that the anemones were maintained in darkness and void of their zooxanthellae thus taking on a bleached white appearance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Toxicity testing</head><p>Acute 96 h experiments to determine the concentration causing lethality to 50% of the organisms (LC ) were performed using standard methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(USEPA, 2002)</ref>. Concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 µg/L copper were prepared 24 h prior to the start of the experiment using a 1 g/L copper, as Cu(NO ) 2 , stock solution (Fisher Scientific, PA, USA) and filtered (0.22 μm) SW. For each concentration there were three replicate 3 L plastic containers, each with 6 anemones. At 48 h, 75% of the solution in each replicate was renewed. Water samples were collected at 0, 48, and 96 h for later copper analysis. In all experiments, salinity, DO, and temperature were monitored daily using a YSI ® 85 Meter (YSI). The average water quality values (mean ± standard deviation) in the testing chambers for all experiments were as follows: 35 g/L ± 0.4 salinity, 7.1 mg/L ± 0.1 DO, and 23 ºC ± 0.3 temperature. Mortality (lack of responsiveness) was quantified daily. Behavioral observations of A. pallida were also noted daily, however, they were not quantified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Sublethal experiments</head><p>Two sequential sublethal experiments were conducted with symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida, respectively. Concentrations of 0, 5, 15, and 50 µg/L copper were prepared 24 h prior to the start of each experiment, using 1 g/L Cu, as Cu(NO ) 2 (Fisher), and filtered (0.22 μm) SW. For each copper concentration, there were four replicate 3 L plastic containers. Six anemones were randomly placed in each of the 16 testing chambers. On day 4, anemones were fed brine shrimp for 1 h and then 75% of the solution was renewed. Water samples were taken at 0, 1, 4, and 7 d for later copper analysis. Behavioral observations, such as color and tentacle retraction of A. pallida were noted daily, however, they were not quantified. The sublethal experiment using symbiotic anemones was conducted under cool white fluorescent lighting with a light cycle of 12 h light:12 h darkness; whereas, the experiment with aposymbiotic anemones was performed in the dark.</p><p>At the start of each sublethal experiment, 3 anemones from the respective holding tanks were euthanized using tricaine methanesulfonate (Western Chemical, WA, USA), blotted, weighed, placed in plastic centrifuge tubes, acidified with 8 N trace metal grade analysis HNO (Fisher) and later measured for copper. Three additional anemones from the respective holding tanks were concurrently flash froze using liquid nitrogen, placed in plastic centrifuge tubes and stored at −20°C for later SOD and CAT measurements. Two anemones were then collected from each experimental test chamber on 1, 4, and 7 d. One of those anemones was used for copper analysis and the other anemone for SOD and CAT measurements using the specified methods. In total there were four anemones per copper concentration for each endpoint at each sampling time (1, 4, and 7 d).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Protein quantification</head><p>All frozen samples were ground into fine particulate using liquid nitrogen, mortar, and pestle. The particulate from each sample was transferred to a plastic centrifuge tube filled with 5 mL of 10 mM potassium phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) buffer pH 7.0 at 25°C, mixed using a vortex, and centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 10 min. Each resulting supernatant was assayed for total soluble protein. A Bradford assay was performed for total soluble protein quantification using the Bio-Rad ® quick start kit (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Catalase assay</head><p>The assay method was adapted from the Sigma catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) online protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sigma, 1994)</ref>. Briefly, a 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was used to prepare a stock 0.036% (w/w) H O 2 (Sigma-Aldrich) solution. One hundred microliters of anemone supernatant was brought to a total volume of 2000 μL using the H 2 O 2 solution. Samples were mixed and incubated at 30 s at room temperature. Subsequently, CAT activity was determined by the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm over a 1 min interval based upon hydrogen peroxide decomposition using a Unicam UV 4 UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Pye Unicam Ltd., Cambridge, England). CAT activity for each sample was reported as specific activity (unit/mg protein).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Acute Cu toxicity</head><p>The 96-h LC 50 values for symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida exposed to copper were 148 µg/L (95% confidence interval =126.4, 173.8) and 206 µg/L (95% confidence interval=175.2, 242.2), respectively. After 24 h, symbiotic anemones, exhibited tentacle retraction and increased mucus in all copper treatments and after 48 h, discoloration was observed in A. pallida exposed to copper. Aposymbiotic anemones also exhibited tentacle retraction and increased mucus production in higher copper treatments but not to the extent observed in symbiotic A. pallida.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Cu accumulation</head><p>Both symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida rapidly accumulated copper in a dose dependent manner. There were no significant differences in copper accumulation between the control and 5 µg/L copper groups in either symbiotic or aposymbiotic A. pallida <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1A, B</ref>). Copper accumulation was significantly higher in symbiotic A. pallida exposed to 15 µg/L copper as compared to the control on days 1 and 4; however, by day 7, the tissue copper was not significantly different from control values <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. The copper concentration in symbiotic A. pallida exposed to 50 µg/L copper was significantly increased, as compared to controls, at 24 h and remained elevated throughout the duration of the exposure. For every treatment, copper accumulation was generally two to three times higher in aposymbiotic than symbiotic A. pallida <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1A, B</ref>). Aposymbiotic A. pallida exposed to 15 µg/L copper had a significant increase in copper accumulation at 4 d and unlike in symbiotic A. pallida, the copper concentration remained elevated throughout the exposure <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. Likewise, aposymbiotic A. pallida exposed to 50 µg/L copper, had a significant elevation in copper accumulation at 24 h, and their tissue copper continued to increase throughout the experiment <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1B)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Behavioral observations</head><p>Symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida in the control group and the majority of those exposed to 5 µg/L copper exhibit normal behaviors during the 7-d experiments. A few anemones in each of the 5 µg/L copper replicates retracted their tentacles during the course of the experiment; however those in the highest two copper treatments were most affected. The majority of the symbiotic anemones exposed to 15 and 50 µg/L copper began retracting their tentacles after 24 h and this trend continued in both concentrations for the duration of the experiment. Additionally, the stalk and tips of the tentacles of most of the anemones in the 15 and 50 µg/L treatments appeared bleached. The anemone stalks collapsed by 96 h and this condition persisted throughout the exposure period. Increased mucus was visually observed in the 50 µg/L treatment group after 24 h and in the 15 µg/L treatment group after 96 h and continued to increase in both treatment groups through the exposure period. Aposymbiotic A. pallida exhibited a similar behavior pattern of tentacle retraction, as observed in the symbiotic anemones. While increased mucus was apparent in higher copper treatments, it was not as severe as was observed in symbiotic anemones exposed to copper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Catalase activity</head><p>Throughout the 7-d experiment, no CAT activity was detected in aposymbiotic A. pallida; however, CAT activity increased dose dependently in symbiotic A. pallida <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. At 24 h, activity levels slightly increased in the 15 and 50 µg/L copper treatments and by 96 h, CAT concentrations were significantly elevated above controls in the highest treatment. At 7 d, CAT activity was significantly higher in both the 15 and 50 µg/L copper groups, as compared to the concurrent control group. There was no significant difference between control and 5 µg/L values with regard to CAT activity over the 7 d test period.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Copper accumulation and toxicity occurred in A. pallida after copper exposure and was influenced by the symbiotic state of the organisms. The 96-h LC values for A. pallida were within the range of other reported acute copper toxicity values for marine organisms; however, some marine species have been shown to be more acutely sensitive to copper. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brown (2000)</ref> reported a 96 h LC of 10 µg/L copper for the coral, Montipora verrucosa and a 48-h LC of 50 µg/L copper for the anemone, Heteractis malu. After 96 h waterborne copper exposure, the sea urchin, Diadema antillarum had an LC 50 of 25 µg/L <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bielmyer et al., 2005)</ref>. In this study, the LC value for symbiotic A. pallida was lower than the LC value of aposymbiotic A. pallida. Cnidarians symbionts are thought to supply much of the energy requirements of the host; therefore, we initially suspected that without a symbiont, A. pallida would be more susceptible to copper toxicity. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that zooxanthellae sequester metals and exhibit a higher tolerance to metals, possibly due to more efficient antioxidant mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jones, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jones, , 2004</ref>. In this study, the zooxanthellae did not confer protection to A. pallida after acute copper exposure, possibly because they were responsible for much of the ROS production. A recent study demonstrated copper toxicity to the zooxanthellae symbionts of two coral species. <ref type="bibr">Bielmyer et al. (in press</ref>) reported a decrease in the effective quantum yield of photosystem II in the zooxanthellae of the corals, Acropora cervicornis and Pocillopora damicornis; however no negative effects were observed in the zooxanthellae in Montastraea faveolata after waterborne copper exposure. Additionally, the Symbiodinium in each coral species differed and each exhibited a distinct pattern of copper bioaccumulation <ref type="bibr">(Bielmyer et al., in press)</ref>.</p><p>The pattern and concentration of copper accumulation in A. pallida differed, depending on the presence of the symbiont. Symbiotic A. pallida exposed to 15 µg/L copper appeared to have some form of detoxification and excretion mechanism and were likely able to acclimate by 7 d, unlike aposymbiotic A. pallida. A. pallida exposed to 50 µg/L copper rapidly accumulated copper within the first 24 h. Aposymbiotic anemones continued to accumulate copper throughout the exposure period, whereas, tissue copper in symbiotic anemones exposed to 50 µg/L copper appeared to reach equilibrium by 24 h. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Harland and Nganro (1990)</ref> reported that A. viridis, exposed to 200 µg/L copper, rapidly accumulated copper in the first 24 h; tissue copper then decreased over the next 72 h and increased again after 96 h.</p><p>Aposymbiotic A. pallida in our study accumulated more copper than symbiotic A. pallida, which is consistent with the findings of other studies, demonstrating differences in anemone copper accumulation as a function of symbiotic state <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Harland and Nganro, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mitchelmore et al., 2003)</ref>. This data suggests that the detoxification process of relatively low levels of copper is likely aided by the presence of zooxanthellae. These results differ from the acute lethal toxicity data, which suggests that the presence of zooxanthellae actually increases the sensitivity of A. pallida to elevated copper concentrations.</p><p>At relatively low copper concentrations, increased ROS production by either the symbiont or host may be nullified by the production of antioxidant enzymes that convert them to less damaging molecules. SOD activity initially increased in the symbiotic A. pallida exposed to 5 µg/L copper for 24 h. This level of environmental copper may have simply been low enough for A. pallida to tolerate. However, excess copper appeared inhibitory and reduced SOD activity, as was observed in anemones that were exposed to both 15 and 50 µg/L copper throughout the rest of the 7 d experiment. While copper serves as an essential cofactor in Cu-Zn SODs, elevated copper concentrations may inhibit the pathway(s) required for the transcriptional upregulation of SOD. Alternatively, increased levels of copper may cause the anemone to divert energy into other pathways rather than SOD production.</p><p>CAT activity was not detected in aposymbiotic A. pallida, potentially making these anemones more susceptible to sublethal copper toxicity if chronically exposed. In symbiotic A. pallida, CAT activity in the highest copper concentrations (15 and 50 µg/L), generally increased above control levels over the course of the experiment and corresponded to the pattern of copper accumulation. Because of copper accumulation and formation of hydroxyl radicals over the first 24 h, A. pallida likely produced more CAT to catalyze the conversion of H 2 O 2 to H 2 O and O 2 instead of hydroxyl radicals. The decrease in SOD activity in the higher copper treatments, suggests that SOD may not have been a significant defense mechanism against copper in this species. However, multiple isoforms of SOD and CAT exist, as do other ROS handling enzymes, such as ascorbate peroxidase <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Weis, 2008)</ref>. The tripeptide glutathione may also aid in sequestration and detoxification of copper <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Sunagawa et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Weis, 2008)</ref>. In this study, the production of SOD and CAT, in particular, appeared to be greatly hindered by the absence of the symbiont.</p><p>The decrease in coloration in symbiotic cnidarians due to the loss of algae or reduction in photopigments has been a common area of study in symbiotic cnidarians because of the detrimental effects on the overall health of the host organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brown, 2000)</ref>. Bleaching not only occurs in times of thermal stress as has been described in both coral and anemone species <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gates et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Glynn, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Perez et al., 2001)</ref> but has also been shown to occur due to heavy metal exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harland and Brown, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nganro, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jones, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jones, , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr">Bielmyer et al., in press</ref>). The loss of zooxanthellae due to thermal stress is known to reduce the effect of photosynthesis, mainly the hyperoxic internal environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Glynn, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brown, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Perez et al., 2001</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Perez and Weis (2006)</ref> demonstrated that the free radical, nitric oxide, was produced by symbiotic A. pallida after exposure to elevated temperatures, which led to the collapse of the symbiosis. Further, they demonstrated that the host cell was a major source of nitric oxide during the exposure to elevated temperature, which facilitated a cytotoxic response and the release of the symbiotic algae <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Perez and Weis, 2006)</ref>. Bleaching in cnidarians has also been demonstrated in response to heavy metal exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Harland and Nganro, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nganro, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brown, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bielmyer et al., in press</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Harland and Nganro (1990)</ref> demonstrated that in copper environments of 50 and 200 µg/L, expulsion or loss of zooxanthellae in A. viridis increased over time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nganro (1992)</ref> further demonstrated that algal loss in A. viridis increased directly with ambient copper concentration. Another possible means of copper homeostasis is the production of mucus, which has been extensively studied in symbiotic cnidarians in response to stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bryan, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Meikle et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Harland and Nganro, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Reichelt and Jones, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brown, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Marshall, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mitchelmore et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mitchelmore et al., , 2007</ref>. The secretion of mucus may prevent the uptake of copper, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Reichelt and Jones (1994)</ref>. The composition of mucus varies between organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Meikle et al., 1988)</ref>, suggesting that mucus may be species specific and serve different purposes. One such purpose of the production and release of mucus is to bind to toxic metals, as demonstrated by the mucus in the nematodes, Enoplus brevis and E. communis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Howell, 1982)</ref>. A. pallida might respond similarly, as increased mucus was observed surrounding anemones after 96 h of exposure to 15 and 50 µg/ L Cu in this study. By 7 d, the mucus had been detached from the organism. Additionally, the mucus production in the symbiotic anemones appeared to be higher than in the aposymbiotic anemones, consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mitchelmore et al. (2003)</ref>. The zooxanthellae of scleractinian coral are known to greatly contribute to the mucus production by their host through the transfer of photosynthetically fixed carbon <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Wild et al., 2004)</ref>. It is likely that the zooxanthellae of A. pallida also contribute to mucus production. The relatively lower mucus production in the aposymbiotic anemones in this experiment could account for the higher copper accumulation, as compared to symbiotic anemones.</p><p>Between 24 and 96 h, the A. pallida reacted to low levels of copper (5 µg/L) by inducing SOD formation and retracting tentacles and at higher levels producing mucus to prevent copper uptake. No significant increase in CAT activity or copper accumulation was observed between and 96 h in symbiotic A. pallida; however, mucus production was most noticeable during that time period in both 15 and 50 µg/L copper treatments. We suspect that mucus production is first increased as a means to prevent copper uptake and only when this system is overwhelmed will bleaching occur, as bleaching was only observed in the highest copper concentrations at 7 d. Likewise, after 96 h, the anemones likely diverted energy to the formation of CAT as a defense against copper toxicity. The low levels of SOD and CAT and high copper accumulation in aposymbiotic A. pallida observed in this study provide support for the increased susceptibility of stressed or bleached cnidarians to low copper concentrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Both symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida rapidly accumulated copper in a dose dependent manner; however tissue copper was saturated within 24 h in symbiotic anemones. Symbiotic A. pallida responded to the increased copper concentrations by decreasing SOD activity yet concomitantly increasing CAT activity. The activity of these ROS handling enzymes was substantially reduced in aposymbiotic A. pallida suggesting that the symbiont is most certainly involved in this defense mechanism. In response to increased copper, both symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones exhibited tentacle retraction and increased mucus production; however, the response appeared greater in symbiotic anemones. At low copper concentrations, the presence of the symbiont seemed advantageous in combating sublethal copper toxicity; however, at high levels of copper exposure, symbiotic anemones were more sensitive to lethal copper toxicity. At higher copper exposure, the zooxanthellae may have been producing excess ROS, which damage the host and potentially disrupt the symbiotic relationship; though further investigation is needed.</p><p>The 5 and 15 µg/L copper treatments used in this study are realistic environmental concentrations in copper polluted marine environments and effects were detected in A. pallida at these copper concentrations. The mechanism of copper toxicity has not been fully elucidated, but it is clear that A. pallida accumulate copper, are sensitive to sublethal copper toxicity, and may be useful in biomonitoring copper polluted environments. This study provides more evidence that the symbiotic relationship in cnidarians is important in dealing with copper stress and may provide insight into the overall health of a coastal ecosystem impacted by copper.</p></div>		</body>

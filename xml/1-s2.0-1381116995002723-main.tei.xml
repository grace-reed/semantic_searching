				<p>The substrates 3,5di+butylcatechol and Ckbutylcatechol were converted to 3,5-di-r-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone and the y-lactone of 3-hydroxy-4-t-butylmuconic acid ester respectively whereas for Cmethylcatechol the complex was inactive.

In addition, Cmethylcatechol was converted to the y-lactone of 3-hydroxy-4methylmuconic acid ester. The oxidation of 3,5-di-r-butylcatechol by [CU,(PD),(DIPN),]*&apos; and dioxygen was found to be first order in the complex. The oxygenated form of the complex [CU,(PD&gt;,(DIPN),]*+ was determined to be more effective (gave more turnovers) than oxygenated forms of analogous dicopper(1) complexes of ligands prepared from furan-2,5-dicarboxaldehyde and 1,4,7-triazaheptane and from pyridine-2,6_dicarboxaldehyde and 1,4,7_triazaheptane.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>There is considerable interest in the investigation of dinuclear copper <ref type="bibr">(I)</ref> complexes as catalysts from the point of view of their reactivities with dioxygen <ref type="bibr">[ 11 and oxidation reactions [2]</ref> of their dioxygen complexes pertinent to the study of the functioning of enzymes such as tyrosinase and dioxygen transport proteins such as hemocyanin.</p><p>Although copper <ref type="bibr">(I)</ref>-dioxygen adducts [3-61 are indicated in the catalytic performance of dicopper complexes, the factors affecting the effectiveness of such catalysts are not well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. The reactivities of dicopper(I)-dioxygen complexes and dicoppel(I1) complexes with macrocyclic Schiff base ligands were described in previous papers <ref type="bibr">[8--l 11</ref>. For the systems investigated (the ligands of which are shown as 1 and 2 below) it was discovered that, whereas the improvement of catalysis was not dramatic for dicopper complexes of 2 compared with 1 for hydroquinones and phenols, the effectiveness of 2 over for substituted catechols is clear cut. The improved efficiency for catechols is considered to be associated with the internuclear separation of copper ions in the complex <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. Therefore, the next logical step seemed to be the preparation of a dicopper complex that allows a greater inter-ionic separation. This was attempted in the synthesis of 3, which was expected to coordinate copper in the cavities created by the pyridine and imine functions, thereby producing a greater internuclear separation between the copper ions than previously obtained in dicopper complexes of 1 and 2. Physical studies <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> on the ligand and on the related dicopper complex of the macrocycle (PD),(DIPN), f ormed from the 2:2 condensation of pyridine-2,6_dicarboxaldehyde and 1,5,9_triazanonane have shown that a ring-contracted isomer of the ligand, 4, is obtained as the main product. The dicopper(1) complex of this form of the ligand was prepared and examined for its reactivity towards dioxygen. An oxygenated form of the dicopper(1) complex was studied spectroscopically and this complex ultimately was converted to a mononuclear copper(E) complex. In this report the oxidation of various substrates by the dicopper(I)-dioxygen and dicoppel(I1) complexes of (PD),(DIPN),, 3 and 4, will be described.</p><p>- The products of the oxidation reactions were identified by melting point determinations, 'H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and IR spectrophotometry. Melting point determinations were performed on a Fisher-Johns melting point apparatus. Proton and carbon-13 NMR spectra were measured in chloroform-d on a Varian XL 200 FI spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported relative to tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Infrared spectra were obtained on a Mattson Galaxy Series FTIR 300 spectrophotometer. Ultraviolet-visible spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Model 553 Fast Scan spectrophotometer. Mass spectral data were obtained by direct probe fast atom bombardment (FAB) on the Departmental VG analytical VG-705 high resolution double-focusing magnetic sector spectrometer with an attached VG Analytical 11/25OJ data system.</p></div>

The reaction system was purged with oxygen for approximately 1 h and then the oxygen was removed by purging with argon. The ensuing oxidation reaction was allowed to take place under argon. Product formation was followed by monitoring the absorbance of the solution at a wavelength which is characteristic of the product. The reaction solution was maintained at 25.0 &amp;-O.l"C and circulated through a 1.00 cm quartz flow cell by means of a peristaltic pump. When reactions were performed with the dicopper(I1) complex as the active species, the system was purged with argon from the beginning, since no oxygen was needed here to activate the complex and the procedure described above for oxidation with the dicopper(I)-dioxygen complex was also used for the dicoppel(I1) complex.</p></div>

The kinetics of oxidation was determined by observing the time dependence of the absorption of this band. The identical procedure was used to investigate the reaction kinetics between 3,5-DTBC and both dicopper(I)-dioxygen and dicopper(I1) complexes 0f (PD),(DIPN),. </p></div>

The main product isolated was the ring-contracted form of the Schiff base which was obtained as a crystalline solid containing both water and acetonitrile of solvation as shown by X-ray diffraction analysis <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The dicopper(1) complex was usually prepared in situ by addition of a stoichiometric quantity of copper <ref type="bibr">(I)</ref> (usually in the form of Cu(CH,CN),PF,)</p><p>to a solution of the ligand. The solution species has been characterized as a dicopped1) complex of the ligand 4 by ' H NMR spectroscopy <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Oxygenation of this compound produces a dicoppedI)-dioxygen complex which has an estimated half life of 240 min. This oxygenated complex (which was detected spectroscopically) was also prepared in situ by exposing the reaction solution, containing both substrate and complex, to dioxygen. The reaction between the oxygenated complex and the substrate is assumed to be more rapid than the spontaneous conversion of the Cu(I)dioxygen complex to the catalytically active dicopper(I1) species. This is a reasonable assumption since related systems were found to have first order rates for the reactions of .dicopper(I)-dioxygen complexes with substrates at least an order of magnitude greater than the oxidation reaction for the dicopper(I1) complex of the same ligand <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr">11]</ref>. In addition, the concentration of the oxygenated complex is assumed to be a constant fraction of the dicoppel(1) complex at constant pressure of dioxygen implying that kinetic measurements of the order of the oxidation rate dependence on the dicoppeI <ref type="bibr">(I)</ref> complex also applies to the oxygenated complex. Oxygenation of the dicoppeI(1) complex is a slow reaction with Kobs determined as 5.6 X lo-' s-' for the process (cf 1.6 X lo-" s- [Cu,(PD),(DIPN),]*+ and 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol, it is found that the initial rate is dependent on the concentration of complex <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>.</p><p>A time course for the formation of 3,5-di-tbutyl-1,Zquinone <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 2)</ref> shows two slopes corresponding to oxidation processes. Since the initial species is the [Cu,(PD),(DIPN),]*+ . .  [Cu2(PD),(DIPN),12+ in this case. The comparatively slow initial reaction kinetics implies that the ligand undergoes a rearrangement process in order to produce a form which is amenable to oxygenation (Scheme I&gt;. Ring expansion is a reasonable process since a higher coordination number is achieved by the copper ions which are now oxidized to copper( Copper(I) ions usually have low coordination numbers such as two or three whereas copper ions are able to expand their coordination numbers to four or five. The second slope of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref> which corresponds to a higher rate of oxidation is considered to involve the catalytic process since oxidation, at this point, is occurring through the use is in the ring-expanded form, 3.</p><p>The dicoppeI(II) complex was prepared by addition of a stoichiometric quantity of copper(U) chloride to a solution of the ligand. The copper complex of the ring-contracted form of the ligand is considered to be produced initially and this is also an active form of the dicopper(I1) catalyst. The kinetics of the reaction between the dicopper(I1) complex and 3,5-DTBC shows that there is a period of induction before the appearance of oxidation product but such kinetics is not interpreted as ring expansion prior to reaction since the ring expansion is slow compared with the oxidation reaction.</p><p>When the dicopper(I1) complex [CU~(PD)~(DIPN)~]~+ is reacted with 3,5-di-tbutylcatechol and the process is followed spectrophotometrically, the green color characteristic of the copper(U) complex changes to a dark green-orange on addition of the substrate. Spectrophotometrically, there is an increase in the background absorbance (with respect to the absorption of the product) prior to the appearance of the characteristic peak of 3,5-di-t-butyl-1,2benzoquinone product at 410 nm. It is evident that there are two sequential processes occurring here. The increase in background absorbance is associated with binding of the substrate to form a complex which is the precursor to electron transfer. The subsequent process must be the oxidation of the substrate. Analysis of the processes through a plot of In absorbance vs. time <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 3)</ref> shows that the curve may be represented by the sum of two exponential terms of the form ue-"" (where a is a pre-exponential constant, m is a constant which is derived from the root of the integrated first order rate expression and t represents time) <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. The curvature observed at low values of t means that the data describes two consecutive processes which overlap significantly. The first reaction is very rapid when compared with the second process therefore, the reactions may be regarded as separate processes in kinetic analysis <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> and were treated as such.</p><p>For catalytic reactions with the CL&amp;) complex as the initiator, the dinuclear Cu(I1) complex of the contracted macrocycle probably is first formed, since the initial binding of the metal ion is fast and the ring opening reaction is relatively slow. This complex is reduced to the dinuclear Cu(1) complex, 5, by the substrate, and the complex then combines with dioxygen to form the dinuclear copper dioxygen complex with the macrocycle in the ring expanded form. This occurs since the Cu(1) complex must undergo ring expansion in order to form the dioxygen complex. From that point on the Cu(1) and Cu(I1) complexes in the catalytic cycle probably involve only the ring-expanded form of the macrocyclic ligand, as indicated by the Scheme 1.</p><p>The catalytic cycle is basically the same as proposed for macrocycles 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> and 2 [l 11. However the difference here is the initial ring opening process to produce the oxygenated form of the dicopper(1) compound. As observed before, catalytic activity is present only in those cases where both the dicopper(1) and dicopper(I1) complexes are active oxidants. In contrast to dicopper complexes of 1 and 2, the dicopper(II) complex of 4 gives a faster initial rate than the corresponding dicopper(1) complex. The explanation may be found in terms of the low concentration of oxygenated complex in solution due to slow ring expansion followed by oxygen uptake of [cu,(PD),(DIPN),]~+.</p><p>If the cycle is initiated with [CU,(PD),(DIPN),]~+ then the activity does not commence until there is ring expansion and formation of the dioxygen complex. After the substrate is oxidized, an active dicopper(I1) complex is produced which oxidizes another molecule of the substrate to give the &amp; <ref type="bibr">(I)</ref> complex; hence perpetuation of the cycle. If the <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> Oxidations with [Ctt,(PD),(DIPN), I'+ and dioxygen initiator is the dicopper(I1) complex then oxidation of the substrate would produce a dicoppel(1) complex which is oxygenated as described above to continue the cycle. <ref type="figure">(I)-(PD),(DIPN)</ref>, and the Cu <ref type="figure">(II)-(PD),(DIPN)</ref>, complexes</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Reactions of the Cu</head><p>The scope of the catalytic process was examined with hydroquinones, phenols and catechols and the oxidation reaction data obtained for <ref type="bibr">[C u ,(PD )</ref>  bles 2 and 3, respectively. The oxidation products are also presented in <ref type="table">Tables 2 and 3</ref> and are shown to be identical for each catalyst. For reactions with copper(B) the catalyst was prepared directly by the addition of copper(U) to a solution of the ligand in 2: 1 stoichiometry, whereas oxidations with copper(I) took place in a reaction system containing the reactants in the presence of excess dioxygen. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref> gives a comparison of the catalytic effectiveness for the dicopper complex of 4 with those of 1 and 2. Although the former catalyst is somewhat slower, it produces a dramatic increase in the number of turnovers. It is evident that there is an overall improvement with the <ref type="bibr">[CU,(PD)</ref>,(DIPN)~I*+ complex when compared with dicopper complexes of 1 and 2. The low values for turnovers with hydroquinone are noteworthy and may be accounted for in terms of the unstable nature of the product quinone. Longer oxygenation times were needed for [Cu,(PD),(DIPN),]*+ because of the slow oxygenation process resulting in longer reaction times which would eventually lead to substantial decomposition of the product by the time the reaction was terminated.</p><p>An enhanced stability of the oxygenated complex of [Cu,(PD),(DIPN),]*+ is considered to be responsible for the improved effectiveness of this catalyst. Such stability is evident in the half life of the oxygenated complex which is more than twice that for oxygen complexes of <ref type="bibr">[C u ,(PD )</ref>  <ref type="bibr">(3,6,9,16,19,22_hexaaza-27,28-dioxatricyclo-[22.2.1.1'</ref> 1T'4]-octacosa-1(26),11,13,24_tetraene).</p><p>A greater half life means that there is a longer solution lifetime of the complex leading to greater activity. The actual structural and electronic factors which are responsible for the stability of the dioxygen complex of [CU,(PD),(DIPN),]*+ are not well understood at this point in time. However it is thought that the increased length of the methylene chain in the ligand gives greater flexibility to the copper internuclear distance since the ligand is now a 28-membered macrocycle com- macrocycles. The structural flexibility imparted by the longer methylene chains results in an improved accommodation of dioxygen between the copper ions since they are able to approach each other at a more convenient separation.</p></div>

However, in the presence of [cu,(PD),(DIEN),]*+ the solution gradually changed color from red to yellow-green. Whether the reaction was allowed to occur under argon or in excess dioxygen the product in each case was the corresponding benzoquinone. The identical products were obtained for both copper <ref type="bibr">(I)</ref> and copper(B) catalysts and in both instances the complex existing at the end of the reaction displayed copper(B) characteristics (i.e. a broad absorption around 620 nm&gt;.</p><p>The substrates 2,6-DMP and 2,6-DTBP were oxidized in the presence of dicopper(1) and dicopper(II) complexes and the products were identified as 3,3',5,5'-tetram ethoxydiphenoquinone and 3,3',5,5'-tetra-tbutyldiphenoquinone, respectively. Reactions occurring both in an argon atmosphere and in excess dioxygen gave the same product. For 2,6-DMP the product was obtained as a purple-brown precipitate whereas with 2,6-DTBP a purple precipitate was obtained.</p><p>Oxidation reactions with both the dicoppei(I)-dioxygen and dicoppel(I1) complexes probably proceed in a manner previously described [l l] where the initial step is the development of a redox unstable precursor consisting of the substrate bound to the metal in the complex. In the case of oxidations with the dioxygen complex of [cu,(PD),(DIEN),]*+ substrate binding is presumed to occur at the dicopper site of the peroxo intermediate. Two phenolate units are expected to bind to adjacent dicopper centers, dissociating after electron transfer to produce the quinone products [5].</p></div>

Within the group of catechols investigated it is noticed that oxidation was most effective for the more highly substituted catechols, which is in keeping with the findings of <ref type="bibr">Capdevielle and Maumy [ 18,</ref><ref type="bibr">191 and also Speier and Tyeklar [20]</ref>. The ease of oxidation of the substituted catechols is explained by the electronic effects imparted by the substituents. Kinetic studies have indicated that the catalytic oxidation of substituted catechols by copper(B) complexes occurs through the formation of a dicopper-catechol complex <ref type="bibr">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr">21]</ref> which is a precursor to the electron transfer. The stability of this complex and that of the ensuing copper-semiquinone or copper-quinone complex subsequent to electron transfer depends to a significant extent on the nature of the substituents on catechol. Electron withdrawing groups give rise to high redox potentials and high stability of the catechol-dicopper complex <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>. On the other hand redox unstable systems are produced when the substituents on the catechol are electron releasing in nature. When complexes are formed from 3,5-DTBC, an unstable quinone complex is formed subsequent to oxidation, and this complex dissociates to give the products. It is noted that reaction of the quinone with the dicopper complex did not produce a muconate or y-lactone, presumably because of the high redox potential of the product quinone. The electronic effects of substituents are demonstrated as well in the success of conversion of 4-t-butylcatechol as opposed to extremely small extents of conversion for 4methylcatechol since there are more electron releasing groups on 4-TBC.</p><p>Other </p></div>

The overall improvement in turnover numbers in oxidation of catechols for [Cu2(PD),(DIPN),12+ compared with [Cu2(PD),(DIEN),12+ and [Cu2@D)2(DIEN)212+ may be attributed to an improved 'steric match' between the substrate and the dicopper complex as proposed by Oishi et al. [ 121.

			<abstract>
				<p>As global biodiversity continues to reduce at an alarming rate, threatened species are increasingly being brought under intensive management or into captivity. However, current conservation management programmes are often impeded by poor animal health and low reproductive success. Microorganisms play vital roles in the growth and maintenance of healthy multicellular organisms, including neurological and immune system development, gut nutrition, and pathogen defence. The microbiome refers to the vast community of microorganisms, and their collective genes, that live on and within a host organism. An imbalance or breakdown of the microbiome may in some cases be associated with severe negative health consequences for the host. Factors such as habitat degradation and transition into captive breeding programmes can significantly alter the microbiome of threatened species, though the effects of such microbial community changes on health, fitness and ultimately survival of the animals remain poorly understood. This perspective article collates important microbiome research in threatened animals from around the world to make a case for the inclusion of microbial research in modern conservation practice.</p>

Saving threatened species requires intensive management, with contemporary conservation strategies including breeding programmes, the establishment of assurance populations, translocation of individuals between populations to enhance genetic variation, and the provisioning of habitat sanctuaries and forest corridors <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Kueneman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Stumpf et al., 2016)</ref>. Many programmes treat or rear threatened species in captive centres with the aim to reintroduce these individuals to their natural habitats and prevent species extinction. However, these efforts can be impeded by limited habitat, disease epidemics, and poor reproductive success in captivity and postrelease <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Stumpf et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Krynak et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">Wasimuddin et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Yang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Zhao et al., 2017b)</ref>.</p><p>Over the past decade, microbiological research has revealed a glimpse of the integral, largely unforeseen role that microorganisms play in animal health and development. Animals provide a diverse array of habitats for microorganisms to colonise, with virtually all animals harbouring multiple types of microbial taxa. These include bacteria, viruses, archaea and eukaryotic microbes such as fungi and protozoa, which form dynamic communities that interact with host species <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(McFall-Ngai et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Colston and Jackson, 2016)</ref>. This diversity of microorganisms and their genes, collectively termed the microbiome, plays key functional roles on and within the host body <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Mueller and Sachs, 2015)</ref>. Since the discovery of these complex relationships, the host and its associated microbiome are now often considered as a metaorganism (holobiont) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Bosch and McFall-Ngai, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>From a human health perspective, microbes aid in nutrition, immune system and neurological development, gut maturation, and pathogen defence (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Wang et al., 2017)</ref>. The composition of the microbiome also fluctuates according to external factors such as cohabitation, medication and diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Rodrigues Hoffmann, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Rothschild et al., 2018)</ref>. Growing appreciation of the importance of the microbiome to human health has seen an explosion of research in this area, T facilitated by rapid developments in cultivation-independent, nextgeneration DNA sequencing technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Costello et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Turnbaugh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Kuczynski et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Gilbert et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Lloyd-Price et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Gilbert et al., 2018)</ref>. Our understanding of the various roles of the microbiome in non-human hosts is also expanding, as is our realisation of the possible implications for conservation and management of threatened species <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bahrndorff et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Jiménez and Sommer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Stumpf et al., 2016)</ref>. Principles that apply to the human context are being adapted more widely as we begin to understand that all animals potentially offer selective niches for microbes that provide beneficial roles and relationships for the host. These niches can change in their function and availability as the host organism develops <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">(Williams et al., 2018)</ref>, enabling the formation of diverse microbial communities and ecosystems which may permit optimal host function and plasticity in response to changing conditions (Zilber- <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">Rosenberg and Rosenberg, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>While a highly dynamic microbiome is apparent in healthy individuals, potentially enabling the holobiont to respond to changing external factors, a breakdown or dysbiosis of the microbial community is often associated with disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Gilbert et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Wagner Mackenzie et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">McKenzie et al., 2018)</ref>. Given the essential role of the microbiome in host health, we postulate that microbial community dysbiosis may contribute to the problems afflicting captive and threatened animal species management. The potential role of the microbiome in threatened wildlife health is of increasing concern, particularly in the face of climate change. Here we draw upon research from a variety of taxa ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref> to make a case for inclusion of the microbiome in the development of management strategies for threatened animals. While microbiome concepts may not currently be at the forefront of strategies to save threatened animals, consideration and management of host microbiomes may improve host health and therefore survival success. In many cases, the cost of managing the microbiome may be relatively small (e.g. adding prebiotics or probiotics to feed), and the possible gains in host health and function may increase overall programme success.</p><p>2. Impact of the microbiome on host health and fitness</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Benefits of the microbiome</head><p>Microbes are found on all eukaryotic organisms, from insects to corals, frogs, birds and bears. Beginning at birth, microbes colonise many niches on and within the host body, with each colonised location displaying a unique assemblage of microbial species and functions. Areas of the body which tend to be colonised by microbes include the surface of the skin, eyes, ears, mouth, nasal cavities, lungs, foregut, hindgut and urogenital cavities such as the vagina. Juvenile humans and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) are known to inherit multiple microbial taxa from their parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Moeller et al., 2016)</ref>, while infant European pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) develop similar microbiomes to their mother in the nest <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Goodenough et al., 2017)</ref>, highlighting the critical role of vertical transmission between generations in establishing initial microbiome communities. Model animal systems have established the mutualistic role that endosymbiotic microorganisms can maintain with the host. For example, aster leafhoppers (Macrosteles quadrilineatus) are nutritionally dependent on two bacterial endosymbionts (Nasuia sp. and Sulcia sp.) which supply essential amino acids, and these microbe-animal relationships have shown patterns of coevolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bennett and Moran, 2013)</ref>. A relationship between facultative symbiont microbes (as opposed to obligate endosymbionts) and host fitness has been demonstrated in pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Li et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Qian et al., 2018)</ref>, wheat aphids (Sitobion miscanthi) <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Montllor et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Oliver et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Scarborough et al., 2005)</ref> and ticks (Dermacentor <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. A selection of threatened animals associated with microbiome research. From top left to bottom right: dugong (vulnerable), Panamanian golden frog (critically endangered), kākāpō (critically endangered), red-shanked douc (endangered), spectacled (Andean) bear (vulnerable), elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata, critically endangered). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) andersoni) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Clayton et al., 2015)</ref>. In these studies, removal of the symbiont led to significantly reduced host fitness traits including fecundity, adult body weight, and pathogen resistance, though the mechanisms behind these fitness-enhancing associations are not yet understood. While it is acknowledged that facultative microorganisms have a long-standing relationship with multicellular hosts, microbial evolution is inherently selfish. This does not mean that microbiomes do not influence evolution of the host, but caution should be employed when implying that intimate host-microbiome relationships reflect coevolution (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Moran and Sloan (2015)</ref> for misconceptions regarding the hologenome, coevolution and phylosymbiosis).</p><p>Arguably, the best-known example of microorganisms co-existing with vertebrates is the role of symbiont microbes in herbivore digestion. Mammalian herbivores employ fermentation to break down plant material in a specialised chamber to maximise fibre digestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Mackie, 2002)</ref>. While multicellular animals are capable of digesting proteins, lipids and simple sugars through enzymatic breakdown, these enzymes are not able to digest the complex, structural polysaccharides of plants. Conversely, many species of microbes produce unique enzymes that can easily digest plant fibres, albeit much more slowly than other food components, in a process called fermentation. Over millions of years mammalian herbivores have evolved enlarged specialised chambers to house these plant-digesting microbes and facilitate the extended breakdown of plant material <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Hobson, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Mackie, 2002)</ref>. In this relationship the herbivorous host provides its microbial symbionts with habitat and food resources. The microbes provide essential nutrients to the host through the production of fatty acid metabolites as by-products of fermentation. These fatty acids are absorbed and assimilated by the host, providing a substantial portion of their daily energy uptake (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Hobson, 1997)</ref>. The location of the fermentation chamber can be situated in the foregut region of the stomach (e.g. ruminating even-toed ungulates such as cattle and giraffes, kangaroos and non-human primates) or in the hindgut (e.g. elephants, odd-toed ungulates such as horses and rhinoceros, rodents, koalas), thus creating two functional groups of fermenters. We now know that microbes not only influence digestion, but also play important roles in many biological processes that affect host health and function. Colobine primates, such as the endangered red-shanked douc (Pygathrix nemaeus) and endangered proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus), are notable foregut fermenters <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Clayton et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hayakawa et al., 2018a)</ref>. Order Primates is a species-rich mammalian group inhabiting a variety of landscapes from the Neotropics to mountainous Asia. Unfortunately, due to anthropogenic activity more than half of all primate species around the world are threatened with extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Estrada et al., 2017</ref>). Because of their close ancestral link with humans and conservation status, primate microbiomes are particularly well-studied.</p><p>Corals have also been a primary focus for microbiome holobiont studies due to their abundance of associated microorganisms, which can be specific to a given coral species and contribute to essential nutrient cycling and pathogen-defence processes (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Bourne et al., 2016)</ref>. Roughly a third of coral reef species have been assigned a conservation status of "elevated risk of extinction", with two Caribbean acroporids on the IUCN red list <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Carpenter et al., 2008)</ref>. The alarming decline in coral reef health globally has provided impetus for understanding the acclimation and adaption processes that may contribute to resilience in reef ecosystems faced with rapid environmental change, with particular focus on the potential role of the microbiome in these resilience processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Glasl et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Damjanovic et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Peixoto et al., 2017)</ref>. Corals possess an innate immune system, but also rely on niche occupation and antimicrobial activities of their microbiome to prevent pathogen invasion and proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Ritchie, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Nissimov et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Shnit-Orland and Kushmaro, 2009)</ref>. These microbial communities are not static: like all holobionts, the coral microbiome changes composition with age, health, habitat and environmental fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Littman et al., 2009</ref>; Sharp et al., 2012; Bourne et al., 2016; Chu and Vollmer, 2016). The intimate relationship between corals and their microbiomes suggests that maintenance of a 'healthy' microbial community may confer upon the host increased fitness and resistance to pathogens or environmental disruption. For example, the coral Oculina patagonica developed resistance to a bacterial pathogen, Vibrio shiloi, which was previously responsible for bleaching in this species <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Reshef et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Nissimov et al., 2009)</ref>. Resistance to the pathogen was attributed to a beneficial microbiome shift <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Nissimov et al., 2009)</ref>. These observations gave rise to the 'Coral Probiotic Hypothesis' (CPH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Reshef et al., 2006)</ref>, developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Rosenberg et al. (2007)</ref> to propose that "a dynamic relationship exists between symbiotic microorganisms and environmental conditions which brings about the selection of the most advantageous coral holobiont". The ability of the coral microbiome to shift or alter in response to external pressures such as rising seawater temperature, providing an adaptive flexibility to the holobiont, has been reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bang et al. (2018)</ref>. This concept was reinforced after antibiotic treatment increased coral sensitivity to V. shiloi infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Mills et al., 2013)</ref>, implying that microbes essential to holobiont pathogen defence were removed in this process. <ref type="bibr">Recently Ziegler et al. (2017)</ref> found that fragments of Acropora hyacinthus corals transplanted to warmer, more variable environments displayed microbiome shifts that coincided with increased thermotolerance. However, host-microbe interactions at the cellular level still need to be elucidated to determine whether patterns of host-derived resilience are directly linked to the microbiome, or only reflect casual associations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Peixoto et al. (2017)</ref> propose using the term BMC (Beneficial Microorganisms for Corals) in place of the CPH to reflect the current lack of understanding regarding the mechanisms by which the microbiome may support coral health. The authors employ BMC to identify and define microbes that play key roles in coral health and which could subsequently be manipulated to improve coral resilience. Considering reefs represent one of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet from rapid climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Hughes et al., 2017)</ref>, understanding their adaptive potential has become a priority.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">The concept of dysbiosis</head><p>Despite the apparent ability of the microbiome to 'collaborate' beneficially with the host, there are also instances in which the host experiences negative side-effects from direct or indirect interaction with its microbial community. Research in humans has indicated that the onset or development of numerous diseases may be potentiated by the microbiome <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Belkaid and Hand, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">McLean et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">Wagner Mackenzie et al., 2017</ref>). The immune system is built by genetically coded factors and develops through learned interactions with the gut microbiota and invading pathogens (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Nishida et al., 2018)</ref>. A major function of the immune system is to tightly regulate and maintain our microbial communities, and prevent adverse activities or responses that would endanger the host. These functions become impaired, however, when the immune response is uncontrolled or misdirected, leading to instances of inflammation and allergies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Belkaid and Hand, 2014)</ref>. Moreover, some members of the microbiome that were previously beneficial to the host can initiate a pathogenic response when left unregulated by a compromised immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">(Xu et al., 2018)</ref>. These relationships can also be altered by externally introduced factors, such as medication or diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(David et al., 2014</ref>, diet in non-human primates reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Clayton et al., 2018)</ref>. Perturbation or disruption of our microbial communities is recognised as dysbiosis, potentially reducing microbiome function and yielding a less efficient and resistant microbiome that is susceptible to infection and disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Amato et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Apprill et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Amato et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, reviewed in Gilbert et al., 2018</ref>. However, dysbiosis has often been used as a blanket term to describe any change or imbalance in microbiome composition, leading to backlash and controversy around specific use of the term <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Brüssow, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Olesen and Alm, 2016)</ref>. Here, we use the term to highlight changes in microbiome composition specifically correlated with disease states in threatened animals, without inferring a causative link between the two.</p><p>Dysbiosis can potentially result in highly dissimilar microbial profiles among individuals of the same species which could have important implications for drug metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Zaneveld et al., 2017)</ref>. However, reproducible and predictable microbiome profiles have also been observed in association with certain diseases (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Gilbert et al., 2018)</ref>, in mammals with similar diets <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Muegge et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Moeller et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Delsuc et al., 2014)</ref> and in multiple captive primate hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Clayton et al., 2016)</ref>. The study of microbiome dysbiosis has extended in recent years to threatened animals such as giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(Zhao et al., 2017b)</ref>, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (Barbian et al., 2018), and amphibians (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Jiménez and Sommer, 2016)</ref>. However, it remains unclear whether these cases of dysbiosis represent the cause or result of disease. Further research is necessary to identify specific instances of microbial network collapse that lead to disease or exacerbate declining host health. While dysbiosis is a concept of heavy discussion, one may still observe significant changes to the microbiome without necessarily associating this with disease. Much research concerning the microbiomes of threatened animals investigates how external factors, such as habitat, behaviour and diet, can alter microbial community structure or composition. There remains speculation about whether these changes can negatively affect the host organism, particularly when microbes with specific metabolic functions are lost.</p></div>

Loss of diverse plant taxa in natural habitats could lead to a reduction of key plant-degrading microbiota, in turn reducing functional capacity of the host gut microbiome in threatened species <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Borbón-García et al., 2017)</ref>.

It is widely acknowledged, however, that zoos are limited in their ability to provide large spaces for naturally roaming species.

Depending on the nature of downstream analyses, the following step often involves extracting DNA from the collected samples, generally via mechanical or enzymatic cell lysis. Microbial community composition is then typically determined via the sequencing of specific, PCR-amplified genomic regions such as 16S ribosomal RNA genes for bacteria and archaea, and the internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region of fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Kuczynski et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Mallick et al., 2017)</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Diet and prebiotics</head><p>Research in humans has revealed that diet can rapidly alter the gut microbiome <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(David et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Peddada, 2017)</ref>, with far-reaching implications for human health and disease (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Carding et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Marchesi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Singh et al., 2017)</ref>. A recent study in captive southern white rhinos (SWR) (Ceratotherium simum simum) found that a high concentration of phytoestrogens (a plant chemical commonly found in alfalfa and soy) in their diet was at least partly responsible for the low reproductive success of females <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Tubbs et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Tubbs et al., 2017)</ref>. By comparing the faeces of SWR and onehorned rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis), which by comparison breed well in captivity, researchers found phytoestrogens were highly elevated in the faeces of SWR despite being fed identical diets. Zoo keepers subsequently replaced the high-phytoestrogen pellets with low-phytoestrogen grass-based pellets and switched the majority of the SWR's diet to Bermuda or Sudan hay. Following this diet modification, two previously infertile female SWR were able to conceive and gave birth to healthy offspring. When this study was presented at the 2018 meeting of the American Society for Microbiology (reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Reardon (2018)</ref> in Nature News), researchers speculated that the gut microbiota of SWR was not adept at breaking down phytoestrogens, and are currently investigating this further.</p><p>Dietary supplements that encourage the growth of healthy microbial communities have also become increasingly popular, particularly for production animals. For example, feed enzymes have been successful in altering the gut microbiome in pigs and poultry to promote animal health and reduce the incidence of diseases such as post-weaning colibacillosis and necrotic enteritis (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Kiarie et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Foo et al., 2017)</ref>. The administration of chemical modifiers such as feed enzymes and prebiotics aims to promote the dominance of specific bacterial species by providing substrates essential to the growth of target microbes <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Schrezenmeir and de Vrese, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Marchesi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Foo et al., 2017)</ref>. Initial studies in mouse models also indicate the potential for supplements such as prebiotics to reshape the gut microbiome (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Foo et al., 2017)</ref>. Dysbiosis of gut microbiomes in captive threatened species could be reduced using diet management schemes to enhance recruitment of beneficial microbes. For example, carotenoid dietary supplements can significantly enhance the diversity and composition of the cutaneous microbiome of Australian Southern corroboree frogs (Pseudophyrne corroboree), which may boost host immune function and resilience to pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Edwards et al., 2017)</ref>. Similar supplements could substantially improve animal health in captivity and subsequent reintroduction success, calling for further research in other threatened taxa. Although supplemental feeding did not alter gut microbiome structure in kākāpō <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Perry et al., 2017)</ref>, its potential for health management remains unknown. Improving or maintaining microbe-host interactions through diet alterations that encourage positive changes in host health represents a non-invasive management approach for threatened species that can potentially be straightforward and relatively inexpensive.</p></div>

(2018)</ref> isolated two unique strains of Lactobacillus, common lactic acid bacteria beneficial to humans, from western lowland and mountain (G. beringei beringei) gorillas. L. gorillae strains were identified as competent plant fermenters and displayed inhibitory activity towards a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. Notably, strains of L. gorillae isolated from wild gorillas were better at fermentation and at inhibiting E. coli than strains isolated from captive gorillas, with strains obtained from wild mountain gorillas exhibiting the greatest antibacterial activity. The authors therefore proposed that L. gorillae isolated from wild mountain gorillas could be a potential probiotic candidate for captive individuals.</p><p>In threatened amphibians, the augmentation of cutaneous microbiomes with probiotics has become a primary focal point in the treatment of disease and dysbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bletz et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Jiménez and Sommer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Kueneman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Woodhams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">McKenzie et al., 2018)</ref>.

Knowledge derived from these studies should help facilitate development of microbiome therapies for other threatened taxa. For example, microbiome manipulation has been proposed for corals as one means to increase their resilience to environmental challenges such as increased seawater temperatures, with shuffling of their Symbiodinium community and other microbial partners conferring increased thermal tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(van Oppen et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Damjanovic et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Peixoto et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Torda et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bang et al., 2018)</ref>.

In children with autism spectrum disorder, microbiota transfer therapy significantly improved gastrointestinal and behavioural symptoms, with benefits persisting eight weeks after the end of the treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Kang et al., 2017)</ref>. Faecal transplants (administered orally, and euphemistically referred to as competitive exclusion) have also been administered in poultry following demonstrated successes in protecting birds against common diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Schneitz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">reviewed in McKenzie et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the success of human faecal transplants in the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea, and its suggested use for other microbiome-related diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Brüssow, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Foo et al., 2017)</ref>, this approach has not been widely explored with threatened species.

While the latter did not explicitly test changes in the gut microbiome, the dugong study reported no changes after treatment. However, recent research presented at the 2018 American Society for Microbiology meeting suggests faecal transplants between koalas consuming different eucalyptus species may help alter dietary preferences by changing the gut microbiome profile (reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Reardon (2018)</ref> in Nature News). Koalas consuming the less nutritious messmate eucalyptus (Eucalyptus obliqua) harboured different gut microbes to those eating mana gum (E. viminalis), and it was suggested that faecal transplants may help facilitate dietary expansion and aid conservation programmes which translocate koalas from degrading habitats to new areas with different eucalyptus species.</p><p>Together, prebiotics, probiotics and faecal transplants have been suggested as disease preventatives and potential antibiotic alternatives by promoting gut microbiome health <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Waite et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Allen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Nami et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Brüssow, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Schulberg and De Cruz, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Foo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Li et al., 2017)</ref>.

We list below future research priorities and directions.</p><p>6.6. Key areas for future research 1. Construct microbiome health indices for threatened species that could help identify microbial community changes which may lead to host vulnerability and disease. 2. Investigate whether specific instances of dysbiosis potentiate or exacerbate disease upon pathogen infection, and identify microbial species or functions that could be used as biomarkers of health and disease. 3. Investigate factors that contribute to captive and wild animal microbiome health, and improve diet, medical treatments and surrounding habitat to reduce stress and prevent introduction of, or shifts to, disease states. 4. Trial modified diets, introduction of natural environmental substrates, and/or probiotic treatments to help facilitate or maintain beneficial microbiome composition in threatened animals. 5. Research the safety and efficacy of potential faecal microbiota or sterile faecal filtrate transplants in other threatened species where it could potentially improve host health, and in future possibly help expand the microbiome's digestive capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Concluding remarks</head><p>Rescuing animals from extinction often involves bringing animals into captivity and intensively managing populations and ecosystems. In historical conservation practice, the prevailing approach was to strip these animals of parasites and microbes in order to 'protect' them from disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Dunn, 2009)</ref>. A classic example is the extinction of Colpocephalum californianus, a host-specific louse on once critically endangered California condors (Gymnogyps californianus), that was purposely removed from captive animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Rózsa and Vas, 2014)</ref>. With a new understanding of the complexity of host-associated microbes and the many as yet undiscovered positive health aspects of these symbionts, it is critical to embrace a paradigm shift for how we approach protection of threatened wildlife along with their microbiomes. Co-extinction of parasites, microbiota, and mutualists could potentially accelerate the decline of threatened wildlife as well as dampen the success of costly conservation efforts. Throughout this manuscript we have further highlighted that changes to the composition of a given animal's microbiome are highly variable between species. While we may attempt to ameliorate microbiome changes in a selection of target species, this knowledge should not be extrapolated to all other species when we lack fundamental information regarding how microbiomes in even closely related species may respond differently under similar conditions. For some wildlife, such as amphibians and primates, we are gaining a better understanding about the mechanics of how to achieve 'microbiome rescue'. For many other wildlife groups, more basic research is sorely needed, particularly for understanding the dimensions of dysbiosis and its causes (sensu <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Zaneveld et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>.

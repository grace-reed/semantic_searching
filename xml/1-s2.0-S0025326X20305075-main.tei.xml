			<abstract>
				<p>Heatwaves are an increasing threat to organisms across the globe. Marine and atmospheric heatwaves are predicted to impact sessile intertidal marine organisms, especially when exposed at low tide and unable to seek refuge. The study aimed to determine whether a simulated atmospheric heatwave will alter the survival of selectively bred families of Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata), and whether survival is dependent on morphological and physiological traits. The survival of S. glomerata families to a simulated atmospheric heatwave varied from 25 to 60% and was not correlated with morphology or physiology. Survival may depend on the presence of genotypes that translate into molecular defenses such as heat-shock proteins and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins that provide oysters with resilience. Understanding the responses among families of oysters to heatwaves is critical if we are to restore the ecological services of oyster reefs and sustain oyster aquaculture.</p>

During low tide, intertidal marine organisms are emersed in air, being exposed to temperatures that can reach double of that of the seawater <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harley, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McAfee et al., 2017)</ref>.

During emersion, intertidal organisms are mostly reliant on anaerobic metabolism to meet energetic requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Truchot, 1990)</ref>, being unable to exchange oxygen, excrete waste and intake food until immersed in seawater during high tide.</p><p>Initiatives to build resilience of marine organisms to heatwaves have accelerated in recent years. For example, initiatives are underway to improve the resilience of wild coral to bleaching caused by heatwaves by selecting and propagating tolerant genotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(van Oppen et al., 2015)</ref>. Similar strategies are also being used to improve the tolerance of macroalgae to heatwaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Layton et al., 2020)</ref>. Building resilience to climate change by selectively breeding from wild organisms can, however, be slow especially when species take years to reach sexual maturity.</p><p>In aquaculture, some species are selectively bred to improve their resilience against disease and climate change stress. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Parker et al. (2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Parker et al. ( , 2012</ref> found that a group of selectively bred Saccostrea glomerata were resilient to ocean acidification.

(2017)</ref> found that certain selectively bred S. glomerata were also less tolerant of habitat warming. Some selectively bred S. glomerata have elevated standard metabolic rates (SMR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Parker et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Parker et al., , 2012</ref> which may reduce the energy available for tolerating environmental extremes such as heatwaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(McAfee et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Parker et al., 2017a)</ref>.

An acute atmospheric heatwave was simulated and the survival of selectively bred families of S. glomerata was measured. Survival was then correlated with morphological and physiological traits to determine if these traits are related to heatwave survival. This study is important because there is a need to create families which contain genotypes resilient to climate change stress. Sydney rock oysters are the most productive and valuable aquaculture species in south east Australia (NSW DPI, 2017) where they provide habitat and perform vital ecosystem services including cycling nutrients and filtering particulates <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Grabowski and Powers, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>

Each family is created by the pair mating of a male and female oyster from families with known pedigree and traits. Oyster larvae are then reared in the hatchery following established protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(O'Connor et al., 2008)</ref> before being grown on intertidal leases. The purpose of creating selectively bred families was to enable multi-trait selection for disease resistance, fast growth and improved meat quality for greater profitability. Selectively bred oysters have been found to have greater Standard Metabolic Rates (SMR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Parker et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Parker et al., , 2012</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Family morphology and physiology</head><p>To determine any differences in growth traits (shell width index, condition index and whole weight), among families, one-hundred oysters from each family were selected and transported in March 2018 to Cromarty Bay, Port Stephens (152°4′0.69″E, 32°43′19.69″S) where each family was divided among three replicate oyster growing baskets (SEAPA Co. Edwardstown South Australia, 600 × 250 × 100 mm) and held on intertidal leases for 19 months. Following nineteen months, eight oysters from each family in each basket were measured using Vernier calipers along both the ventral/dorsal and posterior/anterior shell axes to determine shell height and shell length. To determine whole weight, each oyster was measured on an electronic balance ( ± 0.001 g). Following this, oysters were shucked, and internal flesh was weighed on an electronic balance ( ± 0.001 g). Condition index was determined as the mean family ratio of tissue weight:whole body weight calculated as; (Wet tissue mass/whole weight) x 100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dove and O'Connor, 2012)</ref>. Width index was determined as the mean family ratio of shell width:length calculated as; Shell width (posterior to anterior axis)/shell length (dorsal to ventral axis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dove et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Queensland Unknown or "QX" disease caused by the parasitic protozoan Marteilia sydneyi is a significant cause of S. glomerata mortality in aquaculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dove et al., 2013)</ref>. To determine the resistance of families to QX disease, mean survival per family was determined through a field challenge trial. Oysters were held at Lime Kiln Bar, Georges River (151°03′25.4″E, 33°59′19.4″S) in a QX affected location that has experienced yearly recurrent outbreaks of QX disease since 1994 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dove et al., 2013)</ref>. Each family was divided among three replicate oyster baskets and maintained on intertidal oyster leases. After six months, oysters were collected and the number of live and dead (empty) shells was counted in each family per replicate basket. A mean survival value was then calculated for each family as the proportion of the family that survived the outbreak of QX (Marteilia sydneyi) disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dove et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The mean SMR per family was quantified using the methods previously described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Parker et al. (2012)</ref>. Briefly, the SMR was determined for six oysters from each family (excluding family E due to low numbers of oysters) using closed respirometry. The oysters were collected from in Cromarty Bay, were scrubbed to removed fouling organisms and were then acclimated in the laboratory in three replicate tanks containing ambient seawater (21°C) for two weeks where they were fed daily on algae cultured on site comprising of 25% Chaetoceros muelleri, 25% Diacronema lutheri, and 50% Tisochrysis lutea at a rate of 1 × 10 9 cells/oyster/day. 500 mL sealed chambers were connected to a fibre optic probe for measurement of dissolved oxygen in seawater. Oysters were gently cleaned of any fouling organisms and were starved for 24 h before placed in a chamber filled with filtered seawater (5 μm). The time that an oyster took to lower the oxygen concentration by 20% (~1.2 O 2 mg L −1 ) was recorded. Following the procedure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Parker et al. (2012)</ref>, only the time that the oyster is open and actively respiring (determined by observed decreasing oxygen) is used to calculate SMR. This is done to guard against the oyster remaining closed from handling stress. After measurement the oysters were removed from the chamber and shucked to separate body tissues and shell. The tissue was then dried in an oven at 80°C for 48 h, and their dry body tissue mass were measured on a digital balance ( ± 0.001 g). Standard metabolic rates (SMR) were calculated by the formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= − SMR Vr(L) x ΔCwO (mgO L ) Δt (h) x bw(g) 2 2 1</formula><p>where SMR is the oxygen consumption normalized to 1 g of dry tissue mass (mg O 2 g −1 ) dry tissue mass h-1, V r is the volume of the respirometry chamber minus the volume of the oyster (L), ΔC w O 2 is the change in water oxygen concentration measured (mg O L −1 ), Δt is measuring time (h) and b w is the dry tissue mass (g) of the oyster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Heatwave experiment</head><p>To determine whether atmospheric heatwaves alter survival of families of S. glomerata six families were exposed to a simulated atmospheric heatwave and survival was measured. Sydney rock oysters used in experiments were six month-old juveniles with similar mean ( ± S.E.; n = 30) shell lengths (dorsal to ventral axis) of each family: A = 5.3 ± 1.9; B = 4.8 ± 2; C = 4.6 ± 2; D = 4.9 ± 2; E = 5.9 ± 2; F = 5.4 ± 2.1 mm. Oysters were maintained on intertidal leases within Cromarty Bay Port Stephens (152°4′0.69″E, 32°43′19.69″S) over the Austral summer from December 2017 to May 2018 prior to collection for the experiment. Mean ( ± S.E.) summer temperature and salinity for Cromarty Bay (calculated from years 2007-2019) are 24 ± 0.09°C and 30.4 ± 0.3 PSU respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Scanes et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Oysters from each family were collected from leases in May 2018 and randomly divided into six groups (three "Control" and three "Heatwave" groups) of 30 oysters and placed into individual bags made from UV stabilized "Oyster Mesh" (5 mm aperture, high-density polyethylene, Buono-Net Australia Pty Ltd), to give a total of 36 bags (6 per family). Oysters in bags were placed into three replicate 40 L tanks, with each tank containing 12 bags (families A-F in "Control" and "Heatwave" treatment groups). Oysters remained in bags in that replicate tank throughout the experiment. Tanks were housed at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS) and maintained on flowthrough seawater at a temperature of 21 ± 1°C, and salinity of 35 PSU with a flow rate of 50 L h −1 . Seawater was drawn from the adjacent Sydney Harbour estuary (33°50′23.06″S, 151°15′17.67″E) where it was filtered through a 20 μm filter prior to flowing into tanks. Oysters were fed daily on algae cultured on site comprising of 25% Chaetoceros muelleri, 25% Diacronema lutheri, and 50% Tisochrysis lutea at a concentration of × cells/ml. Oysters remained in tanks at 21 ( ± 1)°C to acclimate for weeks. Prior to the simulated heatwave, all oysters were removed from the tanks and bags were checked for dead oysters, which were discarded. Three of the six groups from each tank were exposed to heatwaves (total 540 oysters; 18 bags), and the other three were controls to account for emersion at ambient temperature (total oysters; 18 bags). Atmospheric heatwaves affecting eastern Australia have become more severe during the last decade (BOM, 2018). During extreme events, ambient air temperatures often reach 40°C (BOM, 2019), however, at low tide, oyster habitats can reach temperatures greater than that of ambient air due to the capacity for substrata to absorb and retain heat especially when in direct sunlight <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Helmuth, 1998)</ref>. Temperatures of 50°C have previously been recorded during heatwaves in S. glomerata habitat <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(McAfee et al., 2017)</ref>. To simulate a heatwave event coinciding with low tide, laboratory incubators (RATEK orbital mixer incubator, Boronia, Australia) were used. Bags containing each of the six families were placed into three replicate laboratory incubators set to 50°C corresponding to their replicate tanks for 2 h. This time was chosen to be representative of the emersion experienced by S. glomerata grown in intertidal aquaculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nell, 2001)</ref>, and to represent an approximate mean emersion time experienced by wild oysters <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Scanes et al., 2017)</ref>. Control oysters were placed on the laboratory bench next to incubators at ambient air temperatures of 21°C.</p><p>After the simulated heatwave, oysters were returned to their tanks and maintained for three days to observe delayed morality associated with the heatwave treatment. After three days, oyster mortality from each family was recorded. Dead oysters had opened shells, or shells that opened when pressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Data analyses</head><p>The survival of oysters was analyzed using a two-factor orthogonal ANOVA with "Treatment" (2 levels; Heatwave or Control), and "Family" (6 levels; A, B, C, D, E, F) as fixed factors. Post-hoc Tukey tests were used to determine significance among levels for factors or interactions of interest (α &lt; 0.05), and residual plots were used to assess error distribution. Simple linear models were used to test the relationship between mean family survival and mean condition index, disease resistance, width index, whole weight and SMR. All analyses were done using R 3.5.3 statistical software and critical P values were set at α = 0.05.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Marine and atmospheric heatwaves are becoming more frequent across the globe. Our study found that atmospheric heatwaves will alter the survival of Sydney rock oysters, with differences among families. Following a simulated atmospheric heatwave of 50°C for 2 h, the survival of some families such as B and F was as high as 69% and similar in heatwave and control conditions, while other families such as D and E experienced a survival rate of only 25% to heatwaves and were significantly different to the control. While there were significant differences in survival of families A, C, D and E between the control and heatwave treatments, there was no difference in responses of families B and F between control and heatwave treatments. Families B and F were resilient to heatwaves. The greatest mortality and least survival occurred in families D and E which suffered approximately 75% mortality. There was no correlation between survival and morphological or physiological traits.</p><p>Previous studies have shown both positive and negative relationships between survival and SMR. For example, Pacific oysters Magallana gigas selected for faster growth, had lower Q 10 values in response to warming, indicating they were metabolically less affected by warming compared to a wild population <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Parker et al. (2012)</ref> showed that S. glomerata selected for faster growth and more tolerant of ocean acidification had greater SMR, which perhaps allowed oysters to actively transport ions and buffer against pH change <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Parker et al., 2012)</ref>. In contrast, greater SMR has been negatively correlated with survival under warming <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Parker et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McAfee et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Parker et al. (2017a)</ref> found S. glomerata larvae, which had faster growth and greater SMR, were less tolerant of warming and lower salinity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McAfee et al. (2017)</ref> found that selectively bred S. glomerata had greater mortality to warming. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Parker et al. (2017a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">McAfee et al. (2017)</ref> suggested that faster growing oysters might have lower energetic reserves to cope with warming and other stressors. The lack of correlation between survival of oysters and morphology or physiology as found in this study supports the poor thermal tolerance of some selectively bred families as found by previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(McAfee et al., 2017)</ref>. These findings also highlight that SMR is not the only factor driving poor thermal tolerance. Other studies have found resilient responses of some families of S. glomerata and other oysters (e.g. Pacific oysters, M. gigas) to climate change stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Parker et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Parker et al., , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wright et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Parker et al. (2011)</ref> found no differences in size or abnormality of larvae of some S. glomerata families in response to elevated pCO 2 . In the Pacific oyster, M. gigas, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wright et al. (2014)</ref> found that some families responded positively to elevated pCO 2 by increasing shell thickness, while others were negatively affected, decreasing shell thickness. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Wright et al. (2014)</ref> found that the SMR of M. gigas was affected by elevated pCO 2 depending on the family line. The SMR of some families increased and others decreased in response to elevated pCO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Wright et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Oysters and other intertidal molluscs may be resilient to stress in the intertidal largely because they have plastic responses improved by prior exposure to stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Parker et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Giomi et al., 2016)</ref>. For example, the lethal seawater temperature of the oyster Isognomon nucleus was raised from 49.5°C to 53°C by exposing oysters to prior aerial warming of 40°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Giomi et al., 2016)</ref>. Also, flat oysters, Ostrea angasi, which had prior exposure to heat-shock (28°C) had greater survival compared to oysters that did not experience heat-shock <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Pereira et al., 2020)</ref>. Survival of M. gigas to a marine heatwave in a previous study was increased from 22% to 95% by adding antibiotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Green et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Green et al. (2019)</ref> suggested that the addition of antibiotics removed Vibrio and other opportunistic pathogens, allowing M. gigas to recover from the marine heatwave without sustaining lethal infections. It is known that the microbiome of S. glomerata varies among families and can be related to QX disease resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nguyen et al., 2019)</ref>, oyster microbiomes also vary dependent on genotype in the Pacific oyster M. gigas <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Wendling et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">King et al., 2019)</ref>. Plasticity in oysters has been attributed to the variable environment in which they live <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Palumbi, 1994)</ref> and a genome which is largely dedicated to dealing with environmental stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Zhang et al., 2012)</ref>. In this study, however, oysters had a common thermal history which removed any differences in responses due to thermal history and a plasticity-based response. Survival of S. glomerata in response to heatwaves is thus likely to be a complex mixture of mechanisms. Survival may depend on frequencies of allozymes like aspartate and alanine aminotransferase and heat shock proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hull et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Somero, 2010)</ref>. Oysters also produce Heat Shock Proteins that aid in survival. For example, the Pacific oyster, M. gigas genome contains 88 Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP 70) genes which are crucial to protecting cells from heat and other stress, compared to animals inhabiting the same habitat such sea urchins which possess only 39 genes for HSP 70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Zhang et al., 2012)</ref>. The Sydney rock oyster S. glomerata has a greater tolerance of warming and emersion  <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Linear relationship between mean survival in response to a 2-hour heatwave and mean a) SMR (n = 5), b) disease resistance (n = 6), c) shell width index (n = 6), d) whole weight (n = 6), and e) condition index (n = 6) for S. glomerata families. Each point represents a mean value for that family, grey shaded area indicates 95% confidence intervals. Results from linear models are shown on each panel including regression coefficients, R 2 and P value.</p><p>compared to M. gigas <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Krassoi et al., 2008)</ref>. Analysis of the S. glomerata transcriptome indicates the capacity to suppress apoptosis in response to warming, attributed to Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Powell et al., 2018)</ref> which can prolong cell life <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ertl et al., 2018)</ref>. Similar processes of gene expression have been found in other heatwave resilient organisms such as corals. Resilience of corals to heatwaves can vary among colonies of Acropora hyacinthus, with those resilient colonies sharing an upregulated expression of genes related to thermal tolerance including HSPs and IAPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barshis et al., 2013)</ref>. Despite these protective mechanisms, oysters are still vulnerable while emersed and relying on anerobic metabolism. Anerobic metabolism produces damaging end-products that the oyster cannot excrete and are lethal once accumulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(McMahon, 1988)</ref>. As temperatures increases so does energetic demand, making the production of anaerobic end-products faster <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(McMahon, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pörtner, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Somero, 2005)</ref>. These protective allozymes, IAPs and proteins may be upregulated in the heat resilient families <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ertl et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Powell et al., 2018)</ref>. Resilience of marine organisms to heatwaves is likely to be dependent on their genetic diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Reusch et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hughes et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Wernberg et al., 2018)</ref>. The acute and lethal nature of heatwaves allows little opportunity for acclimation through mechanisms across generations, such as transgenerational plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Byrne et al., 2020)</ref>. For example, following a severe marine heatwave in Europe, plots of seagrass were shown to have greater survival when genetic diversity was high <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Reusch et al., 2005)</ref>. Genetic diversity was also suggested as the strongest driver of survival of kelp to a marine heatwave <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Wernberg et al., 2018)</ref>. Greater genetic diversity is suggested to provide resilience to heatwaves through the positive effects of complementary genotypes, as well as providing a wider base for tolerant genotypes to exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Reusch et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hughes et al., 2008)</ref>. Previous studies have found the genetic diversity of selectively bred oysters can be greater than that of wild oysters, especially when multiple families are considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(In et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Thompson et al., 2017)</ref>. Survival may depend on the presence of genotypes which translate into molecular defenses such as heat-shock proteins and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins that provide oysters with resilience.</p><p>Oysters are vital to functioning coastal ecosystems, providing employment and food security to coastal communities. If atmospheric heatwaves become more frequent, then communities dependent on aquaculture and oysters may be under threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Scanes et al., 2020)</ref>. The findings in this study suggest that S. glomerata will survive atmospheric heatwaves and some families will do better than others which will allow them to persist. Understanding the mechanisms of why there are some 'winners' and 'losers' to climate change stress will be crucial to maintain food security for aquaculture in a future where heatwaves will be commonplace. Understanding this basis which enables some families to persist will be essential for ecology and aquaculture.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Mean (n = 3) percentage survival of the six S. glomerata families determined three days after the Control (21°C) and Heatwave (50°C) emersion treatments.

			<abstract>
				<p>Coral bleaching involves the loss of symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) from reef corals and other cnidarians during periods of environmental stress, particularly elevated temperature. In this study we compared the thermal bleaching responses of the zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum from three populations along the southeast coast of Florida. Winter (2002-2003) and summer (2003) samples from three geographically separate sites were experimentally exposed to increased temperatures and the loss of zooxanthellae was measured. Population densities of zooxanthellae were analyzed and their genetic identity determined using PCR-DGGE analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region 2. The results showed that samples of P. caribaeorum from reefs that experienced the smallest range in annual seawater temperature released the most zooxanthellae. Seasonal comparisons revealed that winter samples lost more zooxanthellae than summer samples. P. caribaeorum harbored two genetic types of zooxanthellae, C1 and D1a. Individual colonies contained populations of only C1 or D1a, or combinations of C1 and D1a. However, these genotypic patterns did not relate latitudinal distribution nor to differences in experimental thermal tolerance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum is an abundant cnidarian that occurs throughout shallow coral reef environments of the Caribbean, Bermuda and south Florida, including the Florida Keys. All individuals of P. caribaeorum throughout this range harbor dinoflagellate endosymbionts, commonly called zooxanthellae. Dino-flagellates in the genus Symbiodinium represent the most common of these photosynthetic endosymbionts among coral reef-dwelling cnidarians <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Trench, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rowan, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker, 2003)</ref>. The presence of Symbiodinium contributes substantially to the productivity, survival, and success of their animal hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Muscatine and Porter, 1977)</ref>. Zooxanthellae increase the fitness of their scleractinian hosts by enhancing calcification <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barnes and Chalker, 1990)</ref>, mediating elemental nutrient flux <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(D'Elia and Weibe, 1990)</ref>, and providing photosynthetically-fixed carbon <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Muscatine, 1990)</ref>. The algae benefit from a supply of CO and nutrients <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cook et al., 1988)</ref>, protection from grazers, and protection from UV damage (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lesser and Shick, 1989)</ref>. The symbiosis between cnidarians and zooxanthellae is also ecologically important, as it contributes to primary productivity of coral reefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(McLaughlin and Zahl, 1959)</ref>, aids in recycling and conservation of nutrients <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Taylor, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cook, 1985)</ref>, and promotes construction of reef frameworks and habitats by reef-building corals.</p><p>Recently, the stability of tropical and subtropical environments has been disrupted by an overall increase in baseline seawater temperatures and ocean-warming anomalies such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation. This increase in global temperature has had significant, negative impacts on coral reefs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Goreau (1990)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Glynn (1991)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hayes and Goreau (1991)</ref> were among the first to suggest that increasing seawater temperatures could push reef corals beyond their thermal limits. Subsequent studies have linked worldwide coral bleaching to thermal stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Goreau et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hoegh-Guldberg and Salvat, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brown, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Winter et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Different cnidarians have different sensitivities during bleaching events, but the reasons for these differing responses are not clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cook et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fitt and</ref><ref type="bibr">Warner, 1995, see Loya et al., 2001</ref>). These differences have been attributed to tissue tolerances of host cnidarians, and to thermal and irradiance tolerances exhibited by zooxanthellae <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fitt, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Iglesias-Prieto et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Trench, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fitt and Warner, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Perez et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Goulet et al., 2005)</ref>. Temperature and irradiance are factors that have been found to influence Symbiodinium populations in some tropical and subtropical symbioses <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Iglesias-Prieto et al., 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Savage et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tchernov et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Goulet et al., 2005)</ref>. Irradiance and temperature have also been found to be the primary environmental parameters that contribute to bleaching. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rowan et al. (1997)</ref> suggested that some corals are protected from bleaching by hosting genetically distinct symbionts that are more tolerant of high irradiance and temperature.</p><p>Cnidarians also exhibit geographical variation in the bleaching responses to temperature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Coles et al. (1976)</ref> showed that subtropical corals and zooxanthellae from the Hawaiian Islands were more thermally sensitive to elevated seawater temperatures than tropical corals of the same species at lower latitudes from the Marshall Islands. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cook et al. (1990)</ref> found that corals in Bermuda bleached at temperatures that would be normal for corals at lower latitudes in the Caribbean. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">LaJeunesse and Trench (2000)</ref> showed that 2 species of Symbiodinium inhabit the temperate anemone Anthopleura elegantissima over a wide range of the Pacific coast of the U. S., and suggested that the biogeographical distribution pattern of dinoflagellates associated with these anemones might be related to the temperature cline created by latitude.</p><p>This possible link between geographic location and host/algal composition is the basis for the present study. Specifically, we compared the thermal bleaching responses of P. caribaeorum at three latitudes along the east coast of Florida: Palm Beach, Ft. Lauderdale, and American Shoals (Lower Florida Keys). We assayed the thermal bleaching responses of these populations to increased experimental temperatures. The following questions were addressed: 1) Does the experimentally induced high temperature bleaching responses of P. caribaeorum correlate with geographic distribution? 2) How does seasonal acclimatization affect bleaching responses to initiated high temperature? 3) Are different Symbiodinium spp. associated with geographically separated populations of P. caribaeorum along the east coast of Florida?</p><p>2. Materials and methods</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Zoanthid collections</head><p>Colonies of the zoanthid P. caribaeorum were collected using SCUBA from three reefs along the east coast of southern Florida. The northernmost site was off the coast of Palm Beach (PB) in Palm Beach County (26°43.130′N; 80°01.840′W); the middle latitude was off Ft. Lauderdale (FT) in Broward County (26°11.060′N; 80°05.585′W); the third site was American Shoals (AK) in the Lower Florida Keys (24°33.44′N; 81°31.10′W) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). These sites have differences in annual maximum and minimum seawater temperatures and monthly mean seawater temperatures <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref> that correlate with latitude.</p><p>Samples of unshaded colonies were collected from each site, at approximately the same depth (3-5 m) during winter and summer months in <ref type="bibr">[2002]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2003]</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. Single samples of 6-8 separate colonies were collected at each site using a hammer and chisel. Each sample was approximately 10 × 10 cm. The samples were transported to the laboratory within 12 h after collection in coolers filled with natural seawater and allowed to acclimate to room light (100 μmol photons m − 2 s − 1 ) and a temperature of 25 + 1°C for a period of 12 h. After acclimation each sample was divided into four smaller pieces consisting of 3-5 live polyps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Experimentally induced release of symbionts</head><p>The release of algal symbionts at various temperatures ("bleaching response") was studied using the protocols of Hoegh- <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Guldberg and Smith (1989)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Perez et al. (2001)</ref>. The divided pieces were placed in individual 20 ml glass scintillation vials filled with 0.45 μm filtered seawater (FSW), and the vials were sealed tightly. One vial remained at 26°C while the other three were directly transferred to preheated water baths with experimental temperatures of 30, 32, and 34°C. This was done for each sample. Irradiances were increased on all four water baths from 100 to μmol photons m − 2 s − 1 using 100 W halogen lamps. The vials were kept at these temperatures under 12 h light/ dark photoperiods for 48 h, and then removed for determination of percentage of zooxanthellae released by the zoanthids.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Determination of zooxanthellae release</head><p>The release of zooxanthellae was calculated by determining the number of cells that were released in the vials and the number remaining in host tissue. After removal of the polyps from the scintillation vials, each piece of zoanthid was rinsed with FSW, and these rinses were added to the seawater remaining in the vial for subsequent determination of released algae. We found initial complications with the quantitative extraction of symbiotic algae from the P. caribaeorum tissue, due mainly to the large amount of carbonate sediment that these zoanthids assimilate in their tissues. To minimize this problem, zoanthid polyps were transferred to a Petri dish where they were cut into smaller pieces using a scalpel, and then the pieces were sonicated using a Fisher Model 60 Sonic Dismembraner at a power setting of b5 W (RMS) for 3-5 min. This power setting was the highest setting that allowed quantitative analyses of zooxanthellae left in the host. Higher settings tended to break the cell walls of the zooxanthellae (Kemp, personal observation). The sonicated tissue was then homogenized in FSW using a Teflon and glass homogenizer, centrifuged, and the suspended pellet was washed two more times by centrifugation. The final pellet was re-suspended in 5 ml FSW. Numbers of zooxanthellae were determined from 10 replicate haemocytometer counts, which were converted to total numbers.</p><p>After the 48 h incubation period, the seawater in the scintillation vials was transferred to 50 ml centrifuge tubes. The polyps and interior of the scintillation vials were rinsed with FSW, and the rinses were added to the water in the centrifuge tubes. The samples were homogenized in To identify the symbionts in each experiment, DNA was isolated from zooxanthellae obtained from the colonies used in the release experiments. 3 to 5 additional polyps from each colony were transected to expose the coelenteron, and samples of the gastrodermal tissue were collected by scraping with a scalpel. This gastrodermal material, containing algae but free of mesogleal collagen and sediment, was suspended in DMSO buffer (20% dimethylsulfoxide, 0.25 M EDTA in saturated aqueous sodium chloride; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Seutin et al., 1991)</ref> and stored in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes at 10°C.</p><p>All subsequent DNA extractions, PCR amplifications, and denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were done using the protocols of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">LaJeunesse et al. (2003)</ref>. DNA was extracted using the Wizard DNA preparation protocol (Promega). Between 20 and 40 mg of material was placed into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes with 250 μg of 0.5 mm glass beads and 600 μl nuclei lysis buffer (Promega) and beaten for 140 s at 2400 rpm in a Biospec Mini-Beadbeater. The lysate was then incubated with 0.1 mg ml − 1 proteinase K for 1 h at 65°C, followed by incubation with 6 μg ml − 1 RNase at 37°C for 10 min. 250 μl of protein precipitation buffer (Promega) was then added and the extract incubated on ice for 10-15 min. After centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 g, μl of supernatant was transferred to a second 1.5 ml tube with 700 μl 100% isopropanol and 50 μl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.6. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the precipitated DNA was centrifuged and the pellet washed with 70% ethanol. The DNAwas centrifuged again for 5 min, dried, and re-suspended in 95 μl H 2 O and 5 μl of 10× Tris-EDTA (10 mM Tris Base, 1 mM EDTA Solution, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 9).</p><p>Denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to analyze the ITS2 region of nuclear ribosomal RNA genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(LaJeunesse, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(LaJeunesse, , 2002</ref>. PCR-DGGE analyses of the ITS2 region were conducted using the forward primer, "ITSintfor2" (5′-GAATTGCAGA ACTCCGTG-3′) (LaJeunesse and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Trench, 2000)</ref>, which anneals to a "Symbiodinium-conserved" region in the middle of the 5.8S ribosomal gene, and the highly conserved reverse primer that anneals to the LSU "ITS2CLAMP" (5′-CGCCCGCCGC GCCCCGCGCC CGTCCCGCCG CCCCCGCCC GGGATCCATA TGCTTAAGTT CAGCGGGT-3′), an ITS-reverse universal primer modified with a 39-bp GC clamp (italicized) (LaJeunesse and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Trench, 2000)</ref>. A "touchdown" amplification protocol with annealing conditions 10°C above the final annealing temperature of 52°C was used to ensure PCR specificity. The annealing temperature was decreased by 0.5°C after each of 20 cycles. Once the annealing temperature reached 52°C, amplified samples were loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide denaturing gradient gel (45-80% ureaformamide gradient; 100% consists of 7 M urea and 40% deionized formamide) and separated by electrophoresis for 9.5 h at 150 V at a constant temperature of 60°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(LaJeunesse, 2002)</ref>. Samples were run with previously published standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(LaJeunesse, 2002)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Statistical analysis</head><p>All statistical analyses were performed using Sigma-Stat® (Version 3.2). The arcsine transformation was applied to all percentage data. Data sets that satisfied assumptions of normality and equality of variance were analyzed by ANOVA or a t-test using a significance level (P-value) of no greater than 0.05 to identify significant differences. Tukey post hoc multiple comparison tests were performed whenever overall treatment effects were found.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. Two-way ANOVA of the arcsine-transformed data from the laboratory release experiments revealed significant algal loss from P. caribaeorum at each of the three elevated temperatures, with the greatest expulsion at 32 and 34°C <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2)</ref>. Two-way ANOVA of the arcsine-transformed data revealed significant effects of site and temperature, but there was no interaction between site and temperature. Two-way ANOVA of the arcsine-transformed data revealed that overall Fort Lauderdale zoanthids had lower release of zooxanthellae than either American Shoals or Palm Beach, but no significant differences were found between Palm Beach and American Shoals (Tukey post hoc multiple comparison, P N 0.05). One-way ANOVA of the data for each temperature between sites showed an overall effect on algal expulsion at 26, 30, and 34°C (P b 0.01 for each temperature). At these temperatures, samples from American Shoals lost significantly higher proportions of symbionts than samples of P. caribaeorum from Fort Lauderdale; these were the only significant between-site differences <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2)</ref>.</p><p>3.2. Summer samples: effect of temperature on the release of algae from P. caribaeorum</p><p>The collection dates and surface seawater temperatures were as follows: Palm Beach, September 4, 2003, water temperature= 30.6°C; Ft.

As with the winter samples, algal expulsion for the summer samples increased significantly with temperature at all sites ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>; two-way ANOVA P b 0.001). Overall, samples of P. caribaeorum from American Shoals had higher rates of release than those from Fort Lauderdale or Palm Beach; zoanthids from the latter sites did not differ ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>; Tukey post hoc multiple comparison, P N 0.05). However, oneway ANOVA of arcsine-transformed data for each temperature between sites showed no overall effect on algal expulsion at any temperature (P N 0.05 for each temperature).</p></div>

We pooled the data from all sites at each season, and compared the percent release at 32°and 34°. The data were compared in two ways. First, we looked at the release from zoanthids harboring either C1 or D1a symbionts. Since only two zoanthids from the winter samples contained only D1a, this analysis was restricted to the summer samples. Our second approach was to compare all zoanthids with D1a symbionts (including mixed populations) with those without them. Both analyses yielded similar results: there was no relationship between symbiont complement and release <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>.</p></div>

Colonies from Fort Lauderdale exhibited the least amount of algal loss during winter and summer experiments ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figs. 2 and 3)</ref>, while contradictory to our expectations, colonies from American Shoals in the Florida Keys exhibited the greatest amount of algal loss during both winter and summer experiments <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figs. and 3)</ref>. Colonies from Palm Beach, the site with the lowest annual mean temperature, were intermediate. The results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Coles et al.

Data collected from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and Broward County Department of Planning and Environmental Protection indicate that the monthly mean seawater temperatures of the Lower Keys (i.e. American Shoals) were almost always greater than those at the other sites. This site experienced the least fluctuation in monthly mean seawater temperatures. In addition, the Lower Keys are the only site with a monthly mean seawater temperature greater than 30°C during the summer. Yet, P. caribaeorum from American Shoals showed the highest levels of zooxanthellae loss when exposed to experimentally increased seawater temperatures. With respect to monthly mean seawater temperature differences, Fort Lauderdale was the intermediate site of the three, but zoanthids from Fort Lauderdale showed the greatest thermal tolerance to an increase in seawater temperature, and in all but one instance (summer at 26°C) exhibited the lowest percent algae released for both the winter and summer bleaching experiments.</p><p>One explanation for this pattern is that hosts that experience the widest range of temperatures harbor symbionts with similarly wide tolerances. An example of this is the 1988 bleaching event reported from Bermuda by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cook et al. (1990)</ref>. These authors found that corals from patch reefs in shallow lagoons, which experience greater ranges of seawater temperatures than those on rim reefs with more oceanic exposure, did not bleach as much as did corals on the outer rim reefs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cook et al. (1990)</ref> suggested corals that normally experience wide temperature ranges should be less sensitive to thermal stress. P. caribaeorum from Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale, might be more tolerant of thermal stress because they must acclimate annually to broader ranges in temperature.</p><p>LaJeunesse and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Trench (2000)</ref> showed that two species of zooxanthellae inhabit the temperate anemone A. elegantissima over a large geographic range along the west coast of the United States. In northern populations they found A. elegantissima associated with Symbiodinium muscatineii while the southern populations also contained S. californium. Additionally, they often found mixed populations of S. muscatineii and S. californium associating with A. eleganissima at southern collection sites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">LaJeunesse and Trench (2000)</ref> suggest that the biogeographical distribution of dinoflagellates associated with A. elegantissima might be related to the temperature cline created by latitude. Our PCR-DGGE analysis of the symbiotic algae associated with P. caribaeorum colonies revealed a dynamic assemblage of two different clades of Symbiodinium sp. Colonies with only clade C1 and/or D1a were found in all samples during both winter and summer collections. Additionally, colonies containing both C1 and D1a were found at all sites in both winter and summer. This suggests that any differences that we observed in bleaching responses were not related to genetic differences between the symbionts, at least at the taxonomic level we examined. We do not imply by this that genetic differences between the symbiontsor the hostsare not involved in between-site differences. Unfortunately, we did not examine the identity of symbionts released from polymorphic colonies, so we do not know if selective release had occurred.</p><p>LaJeunesse <ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">LaJeunesse et al. (2003)</ref> stated that Symbiodinium types C1 and D1a are common "host-generalists" occurring in the Caribbean. Collections of P. caribaeorum from Caribbean coasts of Mexico and Belize contain C1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(LaJeunesse, 2002)</ref>. It has been suggested that members of the D clade of Symbiodinium are opportunistic symbionts that occupy open niches of recently bleached corals that are in the process of recovering. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baker, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baker, , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baker et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Van Oppen, 2001</ref>). This may explain why Symbiodinium D occurs unpredictably in various scleractinians and other hosts, including the Pacific zoanthid Palythoa caesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burnett, 2002)</ref>. However, it is now clear that corals in the Caribbean and Florida can recover from bleaching events without the involvement of members of this clade <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Thornhill et al., 2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baker (2003)</ref> suggests that Symbiodinium D may be a useful tool in monitoring the health of the coral communities by signaling recent and/or recurrent stress events. The abundance of Symbiodinium D1a in summer samples of P. caribaeorum may indicate that the colonies sampled may have recently or are currently under stress and/or in the process of recovering to their steadystate symbiont communities. To date, few studies have examined the physiological associations of Symbiodinium D within hosts (i.e. the "holobiont"), but the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baker et al. (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rowan (2004)</ref> suggests that members of this clade may have greater thermal tolerances than Symbiodinium C. In our samples of P. caribaeorum, we did not find any indication that colonies with only Symbiodinium D1a were more heat tolerant than those containing Symbiodinium C1 or having mixtures of C1 and D1a.</p><p>There are other explanations for the bleaching responses that we observed. One is that there has been little temperature-related selection of symbiont genotypes at the sites in our study, at least for the ITS markers that we used. A second possibility is that environmental or physiological factors other than temperature maintain these host-symbiont populations. For example, niche partitioning between genetic strains of Symbiodinium may occur within P. caribaeorum tissue in response to different light fields (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rowan and Knowlton, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baker, 2001)</ref>. P. caribaeorum is notable for the amount of particulate inorganic material it contains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Haywick and Meuller (1997)</ref> found that P. caribaeorum can assimilate a variety of minerals from the reef, including aragonite, calcite, magnesium calcite, and minor quantities of siliciclastic components. This inorganic material can account for up to 45% of the total biomass, and likely affects the optical properties of the tissue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Enriquez et al. (2005)</ref> found symbiotic scleractinian corals to be among the most efficient light collectors in nature, because the massive CaCO 3 skeleton acts as a Lambertian reflector, aiding zooxanthellae in the absorption of solar energy. Although no similar studies have been done with zoanthids, we suggest that the crystalline material in the mesoglea may increase the light field of the zooxanthellae at the colonies' surface while potentially shading symbiont populations within the colonies' interior. Such differences in light field could influence the partitioning of Symbiodinium types in "optimal" microhabitats within the host. A third explanation of the bleaching patterns that we observed could be genetic differences between the host populations, rather than of the symbionts.</p><p>To our knowledge, there have been no studies comparing the thermal sensitivities of host-symbiont combinations collected during winter versus summer months. In our study, the winter samples showed an increase in released algae at every temperature <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4)</ref>. One explanation for seasonal differences is that the zoanthids harbored different symbiont populations, but our findings do not support this <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 5)</ref>. Rather, it appears that seasonal acclimation of the host or the symbiont is involved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Downs et al. (2002)</ref> found elevated levels of antioxidants and heat shock proteins in summer corals, which would reduce the propensity for bleaching. Several studies have shown that corals have greater densities of zooxanthellae in winter months <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Stimson, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fagoonee et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fitt et al., 2001</ref>). The combination of increased symbiont density and decreased "host defenses" would make winter corals (or zoanthids) more susceptible to elevated temperature.</p><p>However, we did not determine symbiont densities or antioxidant levels in our samples.</p><p>The spatial and seasonal variations in thermal susceptibilities experienced by P. caribaeorum and its zooxanthellae during this study may indicate the importance of acclimatory processes experienced by the animal, the zooxanthellae, or both <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dunne and Brown, 2001)</ref>. It is important to note that this study revealed there is an increase/decrease in thermal susceptibilities that correlate to both seasonal changes and local environmental conditions. It is proposed that the dynamic relationship between P. caribaeorum and its symbionts may be partially explained by the possible abundance of microhabitats within P. caribaeorum tissue layers due to the large amounts of sediment found within the mesoglea.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Map of Florida showing the locations of the three study sites: Palm Beach (26°43.130′N; 80°01.840′W), Ft.

Most scleractinian corals are colonial 56 organisms, comprised of large numbers of interconnected polyps. Having persisted for over 200 inoculation of amphibian hosts holds promise to prevent the extinction of vulnerable populations.</p></div>

Further, the bacterial communities associated 143 with early coral life stages tend to be more dynamic as compared to the associations harbored by 144 adults <ref type="bibr">(Littman et al. 2009a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lema et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Epstein et al. 2019a)</ref>.</p></div>

Fragments of the coral Mussismilia hartii were inoculated 128 with a bacterial consortium able to degrade water-soluble oil fractions, which reduced the negative 129 impact of a simulated oil spill on the experimental corals (dos Santos et al. 2015). In another 130 laboratory experiment, bacterial strains were selected for putatively beneficial traits including 131 nutrient cycling, antioxidative capacities, and antagonistic activities against pathogens (Rosado et 132 al. 2018). Inoculation of Pocillopora damicornis nubbins with the resulting consortium was able to 133 partially mitigate coral bleaching and alleviate pathogenic infection (Rosado et al. 2018). Thus, 134 coral bacterial community composition seems to be flexible to some extent and adjustable to benefit 135 the host. Finally, a single exposure of coral larvae to the mucus-associated microbes of four 136 different coral species resulted in divergent prokaryotic communities after four months of rearing in 137 filter-sterilized seawater (Damjanovic et al. 2017). Even though the initial inoculum composition 138 was not characterized, this experiment showed that coral-associated microbiomes could be 139 influenced to develop in distinct directions following microbial dosing.

Effective inoculations were 612 thus not precluded by using bacteria isolated from non-coral organisms, which demonstrates a 613 degree of flexibility in the coral microbiome. Altogether, this study supports the proof-of-concept 614 for the feasibility of manipulating coral-associated prokaryotes (dos Santos et al. 2015; Rosado et insights into the efficacy of probiotics for coral reef restoration and conservation, 620 future research should target several aspects not covered in the present study. First, an optimal 621 inoculation regime should be developed through the determination of suitable inoculation frequency 622and bacterial cell density. In the present work, the seven inoculations at 10 5 -10 6 cells/mL arbitrarily 623 followed a 3-4-3-4 days pattern, as no standard procedure has yet been established. Alternative624 strategies have also yielded effective outcomes, such taking coral fragments out of the water and 625 inoculating them with one mL (10 7 cells/mL) twice five days apart (Rosado et al. 2018). 626 Nonetheless, systematic experiments are required to determine optimal inoculation protocols, by 627 using the same bacterial taxa, coral species and culture conditions while varying bacterial cell 628 density and/or frequency of inoculum administration. 629 630 This experiment was conducted over a short timescale (four weeks), which did not allow the long-631 term stability of coral-bacterial associations to be evaluated. It is not clear whether the dosed 632 bacteria would be retained over time, especially when no further bacteria are delivered. Also, shifts 633 in the coral microbiome following transfer between field and aquaria settings have been reported 634 (Pratte et al. 2015; R√∂thig et al. 2017), which could challenge the implementation of microbiome 635 manipulation strategies if the goal is to achieve long-term changes in the coral-associated 636 microbiome. The coral microbiome is dynamic (Mouchka et al. 2010; Sweet and Bulling 2017), 637 especially in early life stages (Littman et al. 2009a; Zhou et al. 2017; Epstein et al. 2019a). As 638 recruits develop and grow, the complex microbial communities associated with juveniles shift 639 towards less diverse adult microbiomes. Due to these natural processes, the impact of bacterial 640 inoculations during early life stages might diminish over time, but this needs to be tested. In 641 addition to life stage, numerous other biotic and abiotic factors may influence the coral microbiome, 642 such as abundance and changes in Symbiodiniaceae species, coral disease, and water parameters of 643 salinity, temperature, pH and nutrient levels (reviewed in (Hernandez-Agreda et al. 2016b)).

Coral samples were collected 1112 at the end of the experiment (day 42) following the seven bacterial inoculations. Red refers to A. 1113 tenuis while blue refers to P. daedalea. Rel ab = relative abundance. 1114 Representative output of the random Forest classification with 100 iterations to identify 1116 the most important predictor ASVs in A. tenuis (orange) and P. daedalea (blue). The genus or 1117 family (when known) of each ASV is specified. Names written in bold represent the inoculated Relative abundance of the ten most prevalent bacterial families across all coral samples 1121 collected at the end of the experiment (day 42).1122 1123 Results from the differential abundance analysis with significance level Œ± = 0.01, 1124 expressed as Log 2 Fold Change for the comparison between A. tenuis and P. daedalea recruits 1125 within each treatment. Each dot represents one ASV (including ASVs 4, 6, and 7 from the inocula), 1126 here identified at the genus level when possible. Positive values represent ASVs proportionally 1127 more abundant in P. daedalea, while negative values are ASVs proportionally more abundant in A. 1128 tenuis.</figDesc></figure>

Variation in 366 community composition among samples was visualized using Principal Coordinate Analysis 367 (PCoA) (Legendre and Legendre 1998). A test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions (Anderson 2006) was used to check for homogeneity of variances and pairwise comparisons were performed between groups using a single-step (Scheff√© 1953) and the Benjamin and Hochberg corrections for multiple testing</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

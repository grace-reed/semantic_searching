			<abstract>
				<p>Organisms are regularly subjected to abiotic stressors related to increasing anthropogenic activities, including chemicals and climatic changes that induce major stresses. Based on various key taxa involved in ecosystem functioning (photosynthetic microorganisms, plants, invertebrates), we review how organisms respond and adapt to chemical-and temperature-induced stresses from molecular to population level. Using field-realistic studies, our integrative analysis aims to compare i) how molecular and physiological mechanisms related to protection, repair and energy allocation can impact life history traits of stressed organisms, and ii) to what extent trait responses influence individual and population responses. Common response mechanisms are evident at molecular and cellular scales but become rather difficult to define at higher levels due to evolutionary distance and environmental complexity. We provide new insights into the understanding of the impact of molecular and cellular responses on individual and population dynamics and assess the potential related effects on communities and ecosystem functioning.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Within their habitats, organisms are regularly subjected to stressors commonly defined as significant environmental deviations from optimal life conditions that decrease their fitness <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Larcher, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Roelofs et al., 2008)</ref>. Organisms may suffer physiological effects affecting homeostasis and changing cellular metabolism and activity, which is termed as stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Lichtenthaler, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Steinberg, 2012)</ref>. Stress can lead to severe damage or to specific responses that prevent or repair damage, depending on the degree of stress and the sensitivity of organisms (sensitive, tolerant, or resistant) <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Lichtenthaler, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Steinberg, 2012)</ref>. Tolerance and resistance correspond to organisms' abilities to cope with stress with reduced or even no adverse effects, using mechanisms of stress avoidance, protection and defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Calow, 1999)</ref>. From an ecological perspective, the degree of stress sensitivity determines the edge of the ecological niche for species by exerting selective forces on the performance of life history traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Roelofs et al., 2008)</ref>. Because these traits can affect population dynamics and hence community composition, stressors (and related stresses) can result in community-scale effects and may ultimately drive species coexistence and community structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Pierce et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Steinberg, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Moe et al., 2013)</ref>. Consequently, the risk assessment of stressors must broaden its ecological base <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Van Straalen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Beketov and Liess, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>One challenge facing ecologists is understanding the mechanisms and extent of stress that influence biodiversity, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. The impacts of stressors are generally investigated using two, often disconnected, ways. The first way consists of analyzing molecular and trait responses to stressors of individuals of a given species, using "omics" and ecophysiological approaches. Such studies are mainly conducted under controlled conditions in order to link physiological and morphological stress outcomes to molecular mechanisms and cellular targets. High stress levels are often used to clarify mechanisms; however, studies using more environmentally realistic levels of stressors are increasing. The second way investigates the effects of stressors on populations and communities using mesocosms and field experiments, involving relevant stress levels and complex additional abiotic and biotic interactions. The majority of stress studies focus on certain responses of either one (model) species or a few closely related taxa. The disjunction of these two approaches results in incomplete and disconnected knowledge concerning how stress affects the diversity of taxa at the different levels of biological organization, and does not allow ecologists to develop an integrative view of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of stress.</p><p>Environmental stressors are widely diverse: they can be abiotic and/or biotic, and often vary in exposure time (acute to chronic) and intensity. Moreover, organisms must often cope simultaneously with several related or unrelated stressors that may significantly influence both the total level of stress sensed by the organisms (multi-stress conditions) and their biological responses. Given the increasing human-related alterations of ecosystems, this review focuses on chemical and thermal stressors, which represent important abiotic stressors related to anthropogenic impacts that species must deal with in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Chemicals in natural ecosystems occur in concentrations from trace to high levels, and mostly as complex mixtures of hardly predictable toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Fent, 2004)</ref>. All climatic scenarios predict that both temperature and its variations will increase in the forthcoming decades, as will extreme climatic events, with side-effects on the phenology and geographical range of several species and on the interactions between species <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Williams et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Based on various taxonomic groups representing diversity keycomponents for ecosystem functioning in terms of primary production and food chain links (photosynthetic microorganisms, plants, and invertebrates), this review aims to analyze and discuss the current knowledge on how organisms respond and adapt to these abiotic stressors from the molecular to the community level.</p><p>Several molecular mechanisms and physiological responses (e.g. chaperone proteins, energy allocation) are often highlighted in stress studies. In particular, the existence of a "minimal stress response proteome" across species <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kültz, 2005)</ref> suggests a potential uniformity in the stress responses of different species at the cellular level. The commonalities of stress responses at higher levels of organization (from individual to community), however, have not yet been clearly addressed. Evaluating environmentally realistic experimental and field studies, here, we develop a wider integrative view, taking into account ecosystem biodiversity and the diversity of anthropogenic-related stressors in order to i) compare how molecular and physiological mechanisms related to protection and repairing functions and energy allocation can impact the life history traits of organisms under exposure to environmental stressors, and ii) determine to what extent trait responses influence individual and population responses, and with what repercussions on communities and ecosystems ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>. Commonalities in stress responses become less obvious at higher levels of biological organization as consequences of evolutionary distance and environmental complexity (particularly involving stress interactions as well as species/biotic interactions) but still remain connected via their energetic based origins.</p><p>2. Molecular and cellular levels: how analogous are responses to abiotic stressors? 2.1. Do abiotic stressors induce similar mechanisms across taxa to protect cell integrity?</p><p>At the cellular level, abiotic stressors cause metabolic imbalances, cascading effects on biochemical and physiological processes, and in severe cases, cellular death. Stress-induced injuries can occur directly by altering the biochemical structures and associated functions of biological molecules, or indirectly through the variation of osmotic pressure, the production of toxic metabolites and free radicals, the generation of oxidative stress, or the modification of signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Cou ee et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Guy et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Srivastava et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Teets and Denlinger, 2013)</ref>. Chemicals such as pesticides strongly affect enzyme activities, the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell communication, independently of their specific molecular targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Cou ee et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Brulle et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Ramel et al., 2009a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bouetard et al., 2013)</ref>. Thermal stresses have considerable effects on the stability of nucleic acids and proteins, enzyme activities, and the fluidity of biological membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kültz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Pierce et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Comparing various taxa, <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kültz (2005)</ref> demonstrated that photosynthetic microorganisms, plants, and invertebrates share approximately three hundred proteins that are involved in cellular stress responses, highlighting a high degree of uniformity among species. This "minimal stress response proteome" seems to reflect the limited number of stress responses that have evolved among taxa to efficiently counteract the adverse endogenous effects of environmental stressors. Indeed, those proteins are involved in the protection (detoxification and excretion, damage sensing and repairing) of the same cellular functions (cell integrity, cell cycle or apoptosis, nucleic acid-related processes, metabolism and energy homeostasis, and redox status) across taxa, suggesting that similarity of responses at the cellular level may thus be connected to similarity of cellular organization and functions at the molecular level. This "minimal stress response proteome" constituted a first basis on which to analyze the commonality of stress responses among key taxa of ecosystem functioning in a context of anthropogenic-related stressors.</p><p>Ubiquitous mechanisms of stress response have evolved in order to limit or to repair abiotic stress-related damage to DNA, protein, and phospholipid native conformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kültz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Moller et al., 2007)</ref>. The constitutive or induced expression of chaperone proteins, such as heat shock proteins (HSPs, HSCs), is one of the most ubiquitous and evolutionarily conserved mechanisms among organisms. Chaperone proteins facilitate the correct folding of proteins in statu nascendi or the refolding of damaged ones upon exposure to a wide range of environmental stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Hightower, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Timperio et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Zhao and Jones, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Srivastava et al., 2013)</ref>. HSP induction has thus been reported in diverse organisms exposed to a large variety of stressful conditions (e.g. pesticides, metals, salts, drought, heat, cold, UV radiation, and diseases), all causing protein denaturation, which is the genuine inducer (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Slabas et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kim et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">Timperio et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bouetard et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Srivastava et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Peñuelas et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Detection of DNA damages triggers DNA repair mechanisms through the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional induction of a variety of DNA repair and recombination (DRR) genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Kimura and Sakaguchi, 2006)</ref>. Completed genome sequences from prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms reveal a large proportion of DRR genes to be conserved, although phylum-specific mechanisms of DNA repair have also been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Kimura and Sakaguchi, 2006)</ref>. Thus, whereas plant genomes contain DRR eukaryotic homologs (closer to human than to yeast counterparts) and some prokaryoticspecific genes (e.g., RadA and FPG homologues), they also exhibit several plant-specific DRR genes (e.g. Rad2 family nucleases) <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Kimura and Sakaguchi, 2006)</ref>. Nevertheless, in species as different as cyanobacteria, plants, and invertebrates, DNA damage due to temperature and chemical stressors generally increases DNA repair mechanisms (base or nucleotide excision repair, non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination), with tolerance being partly related to the induction of similar DNA and RNA processing mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Loeschcke et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kültz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Pierce et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Slabas et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Ramel et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Owen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Brulle et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Oxidative stress, which corresponds to an imbalance of ROS (e.g. superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxides) production and antioxidant mechanisms in the cell, represents a common direct or side effect in stress-exposed organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Cou ee et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Ramel et al., 2009a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Lalouette et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Teets et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bouetard et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Srivastava et al., 2013)</ref>. The accumulation of ROS and related products is generally rapidly counteracted by the enhancement of antioxidant processes to avoid irreversible cellular damage and death. Thus, from cyanobacteria to plants and in aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, chemical and thermal stressors strongly increase the enzymes involved in ROS scavenging [e.g. superoxide dismutases (SOD), catalases (CAT), and peroxidases (POD)], and more broadly in oxidative stress responses (e.g. thioredoxin peroxidases), as well as the enzymes involved in regenerating the main cellular antioxidants (i.e. ascorbate, tocopherol, glutathione) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Guy et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Latifi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Ramel et al., 2009a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Riaz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Lalouette et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bouetard et al., 2013)</ref>. In particular, glutathione (GSH) is the major cellular thiol participating in enzymatic and non-enzymatic redox reactions in plants and animals to protect against oxidative damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Doyotte et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ferrat et al., 2003)</ref>. The up-regulation of genes encoding CATs, SODs and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) has been observed in heat-exposed specimens of both plants and soil invertebrates thanks to genomic studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Roelofs et al., 2008)</ref>. Further, species or ecotypes exhibiting tolerance to chemical and thermal stressors in a wide range of taxa are characterized by higher capacities for ROS scavenging in comparison to their sensitive (non-tolerant) relatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Blagojevi c, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Roelofs et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Ramel et al., 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Srivastava et al., 2013)</ref>. As stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Kültz (2005)</ref>, oxidative stress responses thus appear as an inevitable commonality across various taxa (photosynthetic microorganisms, plants, and invertebrates). Despite sharing similar antioxidative mechanisms, however, activities and preferred pathways differ between phyla. While ascorbate POD is the major H 2 O 2 scavenging enzyme in plants, animals rely on CAT and glutathione POD (GSH-POD) to achieve this function <ref type="bibr">(Fridovich, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Latifi et al., 2009)</ref>. Moreover, phototroph-specific nonenzymatic antioxidative pathways exist. Indeed, phototrophs are confronted with additional sources of ROS originating from photosynthesis, and have evolved synthesis of photosynthesis-related antioxidant compounds such as a-tocopherols and carotenoids, which were also found to be involved in abiotic stress tolerance in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Arbona et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, heterotroph organisms also benefit from a-tocopherol-and carotenoid-related antioxidant compounds, such as vitamins E and A, which are acquired via food consumption.</p><p>Chemical detoxification or degradation processes at least partially precondition most organisms' levels of chemical stress tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Riaz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Russell et al., 2011</ref>). The most widely described xenobiotic detoxification pathways are known as xenome (detection, transport and detoxification of xenobiotics) and as Multi-Xenobiotic Resistance (export). These highly conserved pathways among phyla detoxify endogenous and exogenous compounds through their activation and subsequent conjugation to glutathione, sulfate, or sugars, and/or through their removal from cytosol by elimination or storage as inactive compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Rea et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bard, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Brulle et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Riaz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Edwards et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Russell et al., 2011)</ref>. Corresponding proteins [cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (Cyt P450s), and transferases: GSTs, UDP-sugar dependent glycosyl-or glucuronosyl-transferases, sulfotransferases, esterases, among others] belong to enzyme families widely involved in cell metabolism and biotic stress responses, such as those mediated through allelochemicals or natural toxins <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Leaver et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Kreuz et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Rea et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Lindblom and Dodd, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Li et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Edwards et al., 2011)</ref>. The broad substrate specificity of these enzymes enables organisms to detoxify xenobiotics via novel associations of pre-existing enzymes <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. From molecular commonality to community divergence; cascading effects of abiotic stressors on ecosystem functioning. The commonality of stress responses decreases with the increasing complexity of the biological system. From the individual to the ecosystem level, stress responses result from the interactions between physiological trade-offs, evolutionary history, and additional environmental constraints. The role of the co-tolerance and the functional diversity in stress responses are underlined, as well as the relevance of functional biomarkers (online version in color).</p><p>["patchwork model" or "silent metabolism" <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Copley, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Lewinsohn and Gijzen, 2009)</ref>]. Analogies in the function and amino acid sequences of these enzymes between organisms led to the conclusion that these xenome components emerged early in the evolutionary process <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Sandermann, 1992)</ref>, explaining the commonality of detoxification pathways among phyla.

Among them, polyamines, which constitute the major cellular polycationic compounds in living organisms, were found to be important elements of response mechanisms to various stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Rhee et al., 2007)</ref>. Studies using the diversity of both plants (Poaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae, Brassicaceae, Asteraceae) and abiotic environments (high soil salinity, high soil water saturation, high altitude) in the Kerguelen Islands demonstrated that species undergo the same relative shifts in amine composition across environments despite their specific basal amine composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hennion et al., 2012)</ref>.

Increased synthesis and the accumulation of key metabolites such as compatible solutes is also part of the acclimation processes, allowing organisms to undergo and better tolerate more severe stress.</p><p>To conclude, common metabolic responses to abiotic stressors do exist across phyla; however, some of the common stress-related metabolites may display different functions across species. For instance, trehalose is found in high levels in invertebrates and represents an important compatible solute, while its low levels in plants are not in accordance with such a role but rather highlight its function as a key stress signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Krasensky and Jonak, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Lunn et al., 2014)</ref>. Conversely, stress responses do not necessarily require the accumulation of specific metabolites, but rather the accumulation of metabolites of specific functions that allow the maintenance of cell integrity. Moreover, in some cases, the flux through a metabolic pathway rather than accumulation of metabolites per se may contribute to stress tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Krasensky and Jonak, 2012)</ref>. It thus seems that species have developed a whole range of strategies to adapt to unfavorable conditions. However, these strategies often converged towards similar solutions that may be ancestral or may have evolved several times independently <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>.</p><p>3.

Not surprising, chemical stressors first affect the most energy demanding pathways, which is growth in immature individuals versus fecundity for adults, even in animal taxa exhibiting continuous growth throughout their lives, such as most freshwater gastropods or crustaceans <ref type="bibr">(e.g. G erard et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Dao et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Our analysis of the literature also shows that most studies investigate only a few life-history traits in species (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Cornelissen et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amice et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schmolke et al., 2010 for reviews)</ref>. Thus, there is an obvious necessity to examine more traits simultaneously in future studies to rigorously measure the stress impacts at the individual level and draw clear conclusions about the level of commonality in the stress-affected traits or in their associated trade-offs. Nevertheless, using the energetic approach based on the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, energy-related processes and the rearrangement of the energetic balance may be considered as one commonality of stress responses across taxa (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Smolders et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baas et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Martin et al., 2013)</ref>. Indeed, general traits (growth, reproduction) were found to be similarly affected under stress exposure, with differences occurring in more specific traits in relation to consequent changes in resource allocation patterns between traits, which differ depending on species and developmental stage.

No obvious generality emerges across taxa and types of abiotic stressors, however, for which one would expect common traits to be negatively correlated with stress resistance (or tolerance).</p><p>Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the acclimation (or acclimatization, hardening) process, which improves the development of stress tolerance/resistance, seems to exhibit higher commonality across taxa, despite species specificities of corresponding molecular mechanisms may exist. As an example, cold acclimation has been described in numerous species as different as cyanobacteria, plants, annelids, molluscs, nematodes, collembolans and insects, among which common cold-responsive molecular mechanisms were identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Relina and Gulevsky, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Carrasco et al., 2011)</ref>. In the same way, hormetic effects (i.e. beneficial effects induced by exposure to low doses of a potentially toxic stressor) have also been described across a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to plants and metazoans) in response to exposure to at least 1000 different chemical and environmental stressors <ref type="bibr">(Costantini et al., 2010 for review)</ref>. This commonality of hormesis may remain unclear, however, as the potential a posteriori costs of such stress responses are generally unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Jager et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>To conclude, the existence of a commonality of stress responses remains unclear at the population level based on current knowledge since all hypotheses proposed to discriminate tolerant/resistant populations are verified or denied depending on the examples considered. It is thus hard to decipher if this reflects a lack of knowledge, a problem associated with the different methods and biological end proxies used so far, or if it is the ecological reality.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Common or not common responses to abiotic stressors?</head><p>The aim of this review is to synthesize the responses of a wide diversity of taxa (photosynthetic microorganisms, plants, and invertebrates) to abiotic stressors from the molecular to the population level in order to determine if similar response patterns emerge across species and/or lineages and across the different levels of biological organization. While focusing on major anthropogenic-associated stressors (chemical and thermal stressors), we demonstrated that common stress responses exist at the lowest levels (molecular and cellular), but that thereafter, this generality becomes less obvious with increasing organization levels (from individuals to populations) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The generality observed at the molecular and cellular levels seems to indicate that stress responses, or at least the molecular (e.g. protein-or enzymeencoding genes, signalization pathways, PCD, DRR) and cellular effectors (e.g. key metabolites, chaperones) of these stress responses, may have undergone strong selection to be conserved throughout evolution. This high degree of convergence across taxa highlights that organisms, or more specifically, key molecular pathways within organisms, have only a limited number of options to counter stress effects. In contrast, key processes of the organism life cycle (e.g. structural, developmental, and resource allocation patterns, life-history traits and trade-offs) mostly result from their macroevolutionary history <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hennion et al., 2012)</ref>. These evolutionary constraints, which integrate pleiotropic mechanisms, genetic linkages, complex regulatory networks, and the resulting biology of organisms, may lead to strong divergences in stress responses across taxa, in spite of the demonstrated similarity at the molecular and cellular levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Roelofs et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Hennion et al., 2012)</ref> and the energetic responses observed (energy availability and allocation) that could be one way to view commonalities across taxa. Thus, an increasing divergence in stress responses may be expected with increasing phylogenetic distance, particularly when considering differences in key processes between organisms such as plants and animals (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Huey et al., 2002)</ref>. Although some stress response divergences are observed between taxa, however, a certain level of commonality seems to persist regarding the growth and reproductive traits affected by stressors.</p><p>Stress responses and degree of sensitivity, however, have been found to differ between strains/populations or closely related species (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Hummel et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ekschmitt and Korthals, 2006)</ref>. In such cases, species' adaptation levels and stress recovery capabilities may explain the early divergence between close species <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Hummel et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Roelofs et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Gustavson et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Carpenter et al., 2012)</ref>. As stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Lütz (2010)</ref>, if species or communities are strongly adapted to a particular regime of stressors, they should not be regarded as stressed under such an environment. In addition, similar short-term stress responses are not always linked to similar levels of and times to recovery after stressor exposure (depending on reversible vs. irreversible effects of stress on each species) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Gustavson et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Carpenter et al., 2012)</ref>, therefore differently affecting population dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Lance et al., 2011)</ref>. Such differences in stress responses may result from the recent history of individuals forming populations in terms of events of stressor exposure, which may have modified their adaptive potential. Indeed, stresses occurring during periods that are shorter than an organism's life span strongly select for reversible phenotypic plasticity inducing shifts in behavioral, physiological, life-history or morphological traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Gabriel, 2005)</ref>. Stresses also drive micro-evolutionary processes in species, leading to both genetic and phenotypic diversity and the selection of genetically or epigenetically inherited tolerance in exposed populations. These processes allow the persistence of populations inhabiting environments that become degraded <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Medina et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Angers et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Peñuelas et al., 2013)</ref>. Thus, disappearance of similarity in stress responses across high (vs. low) organization levels may be explained by both macroevolution (at or above the species level) and phenotypic plasticity and microevolution (within a species or population) ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Impact of stress responses at the community level: species vs. functional diversity</head><p>In the field, communities are exposed to multiple concomitant stressors (both abiotic and biotic) to which they can respond by resistance (i.e. remaining at equilibrium), resilience (i.e. returning to equilibrium after being stressed) or disappearance of the most sensitive species, potentially resulting in the decline of community diversity or the modification of species' relative abundance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Connell and Sousa, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Vinebrooke et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">G erard et al., 2008)</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. Even if the effects of multiple stressors on communities are often masked by numerous confounding factors such as biotic interactions (e.g. intra-and inter-specific competition, facilitation, and predation), abiotic stressors have been shown to shape biodiversity patterns in communities and change the relative abundance of functional groups with subsequent consequences on higher trophic levels (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Rohr and Crumrine, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Mouthon and Daufresne, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Pannard et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Feio et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Sundermann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Rubal et al., 2014)</ref>. Community structures vary naturally from year to year, but changes in the richness and evenness of taxa are much larger and more unpredictable in stressed environments (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Feio et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Few hypotheses have been proposed to explain community responses (resistance, resilience, or decline) to environmental stressors. According to the insurance hypothesis, communities with high biodiversity have a better ability to resist stressor exposure because many species provide greater guarantees that some of them will maintain functioning even if others fail <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Yachi and Loreau, 1999)</ref>. This insurance hypothesis is of particular relevance because the mechanisms by which diversity may influence ecosystem functioning are related to the functional attributes of species rather than to species richness itself (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Medina et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Community responses may also depend on interactions between concomitant responses to multiple abiotic and biotic stressors, which occur in realistic field situations. Co-tolerance, i.e. correlations between the abilities of species (or individuals) to tolerate each stressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Vinebrooke et al., 2004)</ref>, may influence the global stress responses of species and communities. At the community scale, biotic interactions may also modify species' responses to environmental stressors compared to those observed in isolated species, leading to failures in predicting stress responses in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(B erard et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Dalton and Boutin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Grassein et al., 2014)</ref>. Based on the environmental stress model <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Menge and Sutherland, 1987)</ref>, competition becomes more important in structuring communities as abiotic stress level reduces, and predation is the main biotic interaction regulating community structure when stress level is low. According to the stress gradient hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bertness and Callaway, 1994)</ref>, an increased stress level in an ecosystem tends to select positive biotic interactions such as facilitation and limit negative interactions such as competition. However, this hypothesis may also be not verified depending on communities and spatial scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Maestre et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>To conclude, the commonality of stress responses seems less apparent at the community level because of highly complex and variable biotic and abiotic interactions occurring under multi-stress and multi-species conditions <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">What are the relevant markers to study ecosystem responses to abiotic stressors?</head><p>Stress effects on ecosystems appear to be difficult to evaluate and predict due to the highly complex network of abiotic and biotic interactions resulting from the multi-stress and multi-species conditions previously observed at the community level. Ecosystem responses to chemicals, for instance, depend on multiple factors such as bioavailability, the biological targets of chemicals and associated effects, detoxification, the tolerance and recovery capabilities of each species, migration rates, extinction and recolonization dynamics, and type of habitat <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Relyea and Hoverman, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Despite this complexity, measuring ecosystem functions (e.g. organic matter decomposition, nitrogen mineralization, carbon fixation) is increasingly being recognized as a potent tool to assess ecosystem health and services and as having value for human societies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Park et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">De Silva et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">MacKnight et al., 2012)</ref>. Because maintaining such ecosystem functions may be related to the maintenance of high functional diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Medina et al., 2007)</ref>, one way to study ecosystem stress responses could be to analyze potential trade-offs related to the development of tolerance in functional traits <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. Predicting the repercussions of stressors on ecosystems could also be based partially on the molecular commonality of stress responses. Indeed, ecosystem functions are closely related to gene and protein expression, enzyme activity and metabolic fluxes, which may thus represent relevant biomarkers weakly submitted to trade-offs in comparison to higher levels of organization <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>.</p><p>Both molecular stress response pathways and functional traits could thus represent functional markers to overcome scale transfer in stress ecology. Because stress response variability is partly related to multi-stress interactions, however, such markers would need to be further investigated under multi-stress contexts. Indeed, despite several studies demonstrating the importance of synergistic effects between abiotic stressors (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Fent, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Faria et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Holmstrup et al., 2010)</ref>, there are considerable gaps for numerous stressor interactions and effects, and there is insufficient quantitative evidence to suggest that the prevailing type of stressor interaction is synergistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ban et al., 2014)</ref>. Thus, the impact of combined stressors at different organization levels is in urgent need of acute consideration by researchers, particularly in the present context of climate change, as chemical toxicity is generally shown to increase with increasing temperature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Moe et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Heugens et al., 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>Due to increasing anthropogenic activities, organisms suffer from exposure to diverse stressors (abiotic/biotic/climatic) in their natural environments, mostly through combinations of stressors (multi-stress conditions) that vary in time and intensity. This review focuses on the commonality of the repertoire evolved by organisms from both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (ranging from photosynthetic microorganisms to plants and invertebrates) to combat chemical and thermal stressors.</p><p>Given the similarity in cellular structures and functionalities across taxa, similar stresses evoke similar protection mechanisms at the molecular and cellular levels with respect to detoxification/ excretion, the prevention and mending of damage, and similar metabolomic changes for energy allocation, secondary metabolites or compatible solute accumulation.</p><p>At the individual and population levels, however, similarities become less obvious. Whereas general traits connected to energy resource management (growth, reproduction) seem similarly affected under stress exposure, differences occur in more specific traits due to both macroevolution (at or above the species level) and phenotypic plasticity and microevolution (within a species or population).</p><p>Abiotic stressors have been shown to shape biodiversity patterns in communities and change the relative abundance of functional groups with subsequent consequences for higher trophic levels. However, communities with high biodiversity are better equipped to resist stressor exposure. This diversity and complexity of communities makes it more difficult to see commonalities in stress responses and knowledge at high organization levels is still lacking to clearly answer to the commonality question.</p><p>Ecosystem responses to chemical and thermal stressors are the result of a highly complex network of multi-stress and multispecies interactions; ecosystem functions and services are therefore progressively considered as measures of its health status.</p></div>		</body>

			<abstract>
				<p>Reef-building corals form a complex consortium with photosynthetic algae in the family Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria, collectively termed the coral holobiont. These bacteria are hypothesized to be involved in the stress resistance of the coral holobiont, but their functional roles remain largely elusive. Here, we show that cultured Symbiodiniaceae algae isolated from the reef-building coral Galaxea fascicularis are associated with novel bacteria affiliated with the family Flavobacteriaceae. Antibiotic treatment eliminated the bacteria from cultured Symbiodiniaceae, resulting in a decreased maximum quantum yield of PSII (variable fluorescence divided by maximum fluorescence [F v /F m ]) and an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under thermal and light stresses. We then isolated this bacterial strain, named GF1. GF1 inoculation in the antibiotic-treated Symbiodiniaceae cultures restored the F v /F m and reduced the ROS production. Furthermore, we found that GF1 produces the carotenoid zeaxanthin, which possesses potent antioxidant activity. Zeaxanthin supplementation to cultured Symbiodiniaceae ameliorated the F v /F m and ROS production, suggesting that GF1 mitigates thermal and light stresses in cultured Symbiodiniaceae via zeaxanthin production. These findings could advance our understanding of the roles of bacteria in Symbiodiniaceae and the coral holobiont, thereby contributing to the development of novel approaches toward coral protection through the use of symbiotic bacteria and their metabolites. IMPORTANCE Occupying less than 1% of the seas, coral reefs are estimated to harbor ϳ25% of all marine species. However, the destruction of coral reefs has intensified in the face of global climate changes, such as rising seawater temperatures, which induce the overproduction of reactive oxygen species harmful to corals. Although reef-building corals form complex consortia with bacteria and photosynthetic endosymbiotic algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae, the functional roles of coral-associated bacteria remain largely elusive. By manipulating the Symbiodiniaceae bacterial community, we demonstrated that a bacterium that produces an antioxidant carotenoid could mitigate thermal and light stresses in cultured Symbiodiniaceae isolated from a reef-building coral. Therefore, this study illuminates the unexplored roles of coral-associated bacteria under stressful conditions.</p>

Reef-building corals are characterized by the formation of a holobiont associated with endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae and other microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. In the coral holobiont, Symbiodiniaceae translocate photosynthetic products to the coral host, which, in turn, supplies carbon dioxide and inorganic nutrients to algal endosymbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref>. However, this symbiotic relationship is fragile and believed to collapse (i.e., coral bleaching) through the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the endosymbiotic algae because of thermal and light stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>. Prolonged bleaching ultimately leads to death unless the corals can reconstitute their association with Symbiodiniaceae, especially those with a high stress tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>. Therefore, understanding and enhancing the stress resistance of Symbiodiniaceae is important for sustaining coral holobiont health under stressful conditions, as demonstrated by several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, the beneficial roles of bacteria in the coral holobiont have been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. These functions include defense against pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13)</ref> and the cycling of nutrients such as nitrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref> and sulfur <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>. Moreover, coral-associated bacteria have been proposed to be involved in coral resistance to bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17)</ref>, which has a devastating impact on reefs worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.

In manipulating this bacterial community, we identified a bacterium that improves the thermal and light tolerances of cultured Symbiodiniaceae. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the observed increased stress resistance of cultured Symbiodiniaceae. This study demonstrates the importance of alga-bacterium interactions, paving the way toward a better understanding of the bacterial contribution to coral holobiont physiology under stressful conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Bacterial community affects stress tolerance of cultured Symbiodiniaceae. To investigate the relationship between the bacterial community and the stress tolerance of Symbiodiniaceae, we isolated and cultured Symbiodiniaceae from G. fascicularis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1a)</ref>. The bacterial community of the cultured Symbiodiniaceae (i.e., the control) was dominated by bacteria affiliated with the classes Alphaproteobacteria and Flavobacteriia <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1b)</ref>. To perturb this bacterial community, we administered an antibiotic mixture (50 g/ml of kanamycin, 100 g/ml of ampicillin, and 50 g/ml of streptomycin) (21) to the algal culture (Abx), resulting in the elimination of operational taxonomic unit 2 (OTU2) (Flavobacteriia) sequences and an increase in the relative abundance of bacteria affiliated with the class Cytophagia <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1b)</ref>.</p><p>To examine the effects of the altered bacterial community on the stress tolerance of the cultured Symbiodiniaceae, we exposed algal cultures to thermal stress (at a temperature of 31.5°C and a normal light intensity of 50 mol photons m Ϫ2 s Ϫ1 ) and light stress (at a temperature of 24°C and a high light intensity of 200 mol photons m Ϫ2 s Ϫ1 ). Consequently, the Abx group showed a significantly lower maximum quantum yield of PSII (variable fluorescence divided by maximum fluorescence [F v /F m ]) and increased ROS production under thermal and light stresses, whereas no significant differences in the F v /F m and ROS production were observed under nonstressful conditions between the control and Abx groups ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a</ref> to e).</p><p>To confirm that these changes in the stress tolerance of Symbiodiniaceae were induced in a manner dependent on the abundance of OTU2, we isolated a bacterium (named GF1) with a 16S rRNA gene sequence identical to the representative sequence of OTU2 from the Symbiodiniaceae culture <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3a)</ref>. The 16S rRNA sequence of GF1 showed 95.7% similarity to that of the most closely related strain, Muricauda lutaonensis CC-HSB-11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23)</ref>, which belongs to the family Flavobacteriaceae <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3b</ref>). We inoculated antibiotic-treated Symbiodiniaceae with GF1 and cultured them for 3 months without antibiotics to stabilize the association with GF1 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1a)</ref>. Consequently, the resultant Symbiodiniaceae (AbxϩGF1) showed a similar bacterial community ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b  and 3c</ref>) and stress tolerance to those of the control ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a to e</ref>), suggesting that GF1 conferred stress tolerance to the cultured Symbiodiniaceae.</p><p>GF1 produces zeaxanthin. To investigate the possible mechanisms by which GF1 ameliorated oxidative damage (i.e., deterioration of F v /F m and ROS production) in the cultured Symbiodiniaceae, we analyzed the metabolites produced in GF1, which accumulates orange pigments <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3a)</ref>. Since bacteria in the genus Muricauda are characterized by the production of the natural xanthophyll pigment zeaxanthin <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24)</ref>, which scavenges ROS and protects photosynthetic organisms from lipid peroxidation and photooxidative stress via nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) (25, 26), we hypothesized that GF1 produced zeaxanthin, thus increasing the stress tolerance of the cultured Symbiodiniaceae.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the genome of GF1 to determine whether this bacterium has the zeaxanthin biosynthesis pathway. A total of 63 contigs yielded a genome sequence (5,283,345 bp) with 85ϫ coverage and an N 50 value of 345,017. We confirmed the presence of all of the genes necessary for zeaxanthin biosynthesis in the GF1 genome ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref>; see also <ref type="table">Table S4</ref> in the supplemental material), encoding phytoene synthase (peg.3273), phytoene dehydrogenase (peg.3271 and peg.3274), lycopene ␤-cyclase (peg.4086), and ␤-carotene hydroxylase (peg.3272). All of the zeaxanthin biosynthesis genes, except for lycopene ␤-cyclase (peg.4086), were located downstream of a gene encoding a MerR family transcriptional regulator (peg.3275) with a vitamin B 12 -binding domain ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 4b</ref> and <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>), suggesting that carotenogenesis is regulated in response to photooxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28)</ref>. The biosynthesis pathways of other carotenoids were not confirmed in the GF1 genome, suggesting that zeaxanthin is most likely involved in stress mitigation. We further examined zeaxanthin production by GF1 at the metabolite level using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode (see <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>). The yield of zeaxanthin was 8.03 Ϯ 0.85 g/g wet cell weight <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4c)</ref>.</p><p>Zeaxanthin mitigates thermal and light stresses in cultured Symbiodiniaceae. Next, we examined whether zeaxanthin supplementation to cultured Symbiodiniaceae can mitigate the oxidative damage induced by thermal and light stresses. Incubating the Abx algal culture with 1 g/ml (1.76 M) zeaxanthin resulted in significantly higher F v /F m and lower ROS production under thermal stress ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5a and b)</ref>. Under light stress, 0.1 and 1 g/ml zeaxanthin supplementation significantly improved the F v /F m and ameliorated ROS production ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5c and d)</ref>. These results indicate that zeaxanthin is effective in mitigating thermal and light stresses and that cultured Symbiodiniaceae may benefit from the zeaxanthin supplied by GF1 under stressful conditions.</p><p>To investigate whether zeaxanthin dosages (0.1 and 1 g/ml) are comparable to the zeaxanthin production by GF1, we performed colony-forming assays of GF1 in the AbxϩGF1 algal culture and estimated the zeaxanthin production before and after stress challenges. The CFU of GF1 were 6.16 ϫ 10 7 , 8.96 ϫ 10 7 , and 9.40 ϫ 10 7 CFU/ml after 0-, 6-, and 8-day thermal stress exposure, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6a</ref>), and 5.92 ϫ 10 7 , 8.88 ϫ 10 7 , and 1.14 ϫ 10 8 CFU/ml after 0-, 1-, and 3-day light stress challenges, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6c</ref>). As 1 g wet cell weight of GF1 was equivalent to 9.39 ϫ 10 9 CFU and the yield of zeaxanthin was 8.03 g/g wet cell weight ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 4c</ref>), the zeaxanthin productions by GF1 in the algal culture were estimated to be 8.04 ϫ 10 Ϫ2 g/ml after the 8-day thermal stress exposure ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6b</ref>) and 9.72 ϫ 10 Ϫ2 g/ml after the 3-day light stress exposure ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6d</ref>). Given that 0.1 and 1 g/ml of zeaxanthin supplementation are required to significantly reduce oxidative damage under light and thermal stress conditions, respectively ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5</ref>), GF1 was able to yield a comparable amount (9.72 ϫ 10 Ϫ2 g/ml) of zeaxanthin required to mitigate light stress (0.1 g/ml). Conversely, the estimated zeaxanthin production (8.04 ϫ 10 Ϫ2 g/ml) was an order of magnitude less than the effective amount (1 g/ml) under the thermal stress condition  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6b</ref>). This inconsistency suggests the presence of GF1-derived metabolites other than zeaxanthin that are also responsible for mitigating thermal stress and/or the potential importance of phycosphere interactions wherein the local concentration of zeaxanthin is significantly higher than the bulk concentration in the medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref>.</p><p>Flavobacteriaceae bacteria are associated with cultured Symbiodiniaceae and corals. To determine whether there are close interactions between bacteria and algae, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled oligonucleotide probe, CF319a <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>, to specifically target the 16S rRNA sequence of Flavobacteriaceae bacteria (GF1). FAM signals were detected from bacteria in the vicinity of autofluorescent Symbiodiniaceae cells in the control and AbxϩGF1 cultures but were absent in the Abx algal culture <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>. This result suggests that the signals were derived from Flavobacteriaceae bacteria (GF1) and that Flavobacteriaceae bacteria were intimately associated with Symbiodiniaceae rather than present only in the medium.</p><p>Moreover, we investigated whether Flavobacteriaceae bacteria are associated with corals. To this end, we isolated bacteria from coral tissue homogenates and sequenced the 16S rRNA genes of the bacteria. Consequently, 14.7% of all of the isolates that formed colonies on marine agar plates (19/129 colonies) showed a 16S rRNA gene sequence identical to that of GF1 (see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>), suggesting that zeaxanthin-producing bacteria are not only associated with cultured Symbiodiniaceae but also present in coral holobionts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Several studies have demonstrated that Muricauda bacteria are intimately associated with microalgae, including Symbiodiniaceae <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31)</ref>. However, their functional roles have yet be investigated. This study revealed that GF1, a close relative to M. lutaonensis, contributes to enhancing the stress resistance of cultured Symbiodiniaceae. Interestingly, Muricauda is one of 12 bacterial genera ubiquitously associated with various reef-building corals across the globe, suggesting its functional importance not only in cultured Symbiodiniaceae but also in coral holobionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref>.</p><p>Zeaxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid present in photosynthetic organisms such as plants and algae <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32)</ref>. In addition to its antioxidant activity, zeaxanthin can serve as a membrane stabilizer in chloroplasts to increase their thermal tolerance by decreasing membrane fluidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34)</ref>. Zeaxanthin is also known to accumulate via the xanthophyll cycle in response to excess light exposure and to induce NPQ by dissipating excess excitation energy as heat <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>. Since the xanthophyll cycle is composed of diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin (which is functionally equivalent to zeaxanthin) in microalgae such as dinoflagellates and diatoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36)</ref>, the zeaxanthin produced by GF1 could be converted into diatoxanthin in Symbiodiniaceae to induce NPQ, thereby protecting them from light stress. Although we hypothesized that GF1 contributes to the improved stress tolerance of cultured Symbiodiniaceae through zeaxanthin production, several peaks of metabolites other than zeaxanthin were also detected from the GF1 extract (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref> in the supplemental material). These metabolites may also contribute to enhancing the stress tolerance of cultured Symbiodiniaceae. Further studies are warranted to scrutinize the dynamics of zeaxanthin and such metabolites in the phycosphere to determine the detailed mechanisms by which GF1 helps cultured Symbiodiniaceae cope with thermal and light stresses.</p><p>We observed that Alphaproteobacteria (OTU1) were not eliminated from the Symbiodiniaceae culture by antibiotics, which is consistent with a previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref>. Since the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria was higher in the Abx group than in the control and AbxϩGF1 groups <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1b)</ref>, it is difficult to completely exclude the possibility that the Alphaproteobacteria are opportunistic and increase algal oxidative stress upon environmental stress, e.g., by producing virulence factors. To our knowledge, Vibrio shilonii <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(37)</ref> and Vibrio coralliilyticus <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref> are the only pathogens that have been shown to cause photoinhibition in Symbiodiniaceae. In contrast, Alphaproteobacteria are assumed to have beneficial functions such as growth promotion, nutrient cycling, and production of bioactive compounds (e.g., vitamin B 12 ) that are most likely essential for the survival of cultured Symbiodiniaceae <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(42)</ref>. Indeed, the 16S rRNA gene sequence of an alphaproteobacterium isolated from an algal culture in the present study showed the highest similarity (99.3%) to that of a Symbiodiniaceae-associated bacterium, alpha proteobacterium Mf 1.05b.01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref>, which possesses a predicted vitamin B 12 biosynthesis pathway (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S2</ref>). Further microbiome manipulations such as phage treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44)</ref> for the elimination of Alphaproteobacteria are required to ascertain whether Alphaproteobacteria (OTU1) are beneficial to cultured Symbiodiniaceae.</p><p>To isolate Symbiodiniaceae from corals, we used antibiotics to suppress the growth of bacteria; otherwise, the algal cells would not have been able to grow <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>. Therefore, the bacterial community of the control algae was perturbed, and some bacteria with important functions for Symbiodiniaceae may have been eliminated at the start of the stress experiments. Techniques such as droplet microfluidics may enable the isolation and cultivation of Symbiodiniaceae without antibiotic usage to facilitate the analysis of interactions between Symbiodiniaceae and an intact bacterial community. Although the antibiotic treatment definitely brought about an artificial effect on the bacterial community of the control algae, which showed low bacterial diversity, this enabled us to disentangle the complex interactions between Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria. Since, compared with that of corals, the bacterial communities of algal cultures are simple and amenable to manipulation through antibiotic treatment and bacterial inoculation, as shown in the present and previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45)</ref>, cultured Symbiodiniaceae can be used as a platform for initial screenings and functional assessments of bacteria that are beneficial or harmful to Symbiodiniaceae and the coral holobiont.</p><p>Future studies should focus on determining the functions and localizations of zeaxanthin-producing bacteria in the coral holobiont. For example, whether zeaxanthinproducing bacteria are present within the coral tissues would be a major determinant of their ROS-scavenging capabilities, given that ROS production on endosymbiotic algae would first affect the gastrodermal cells of the coral host. In conclusion, this study illuminates the beneficial effects of bacteria on cultured Symbiodiniaceae and contributes to the understanding and enhancing of the stress resistance of the coral holobiont, which is facing unprecedented environmental stress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>Coral culture and Symbiodiniaceae isolation. The G. fascicularis colonies were purchased from Shimizu Laboratory Supplies (Kyoto, Japan) and kept at 24°C in an aquarium (Shimizu Laboratory Supplies) containing ϳ200 liters of artificial seawater prepared with Coral Pro Salt (Red Sea, Houston, TX, USA). The aquarium was equipped with a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp (KR90DR; Blue Harbor, Osaka, Japan), and 10% of the seawater was replaced every 3 to 4 days.</p><p>To isolate Symbiodiniaceae, a G. fascicularis colony was fragmented to obtain a single polyp and centrifuged at 100 ϫ g for 10 s in a 1.5-ml tube to remove surface-associated seawater. The tissue of the polyp was harvested by further centrifugation at 8,000 ϫ g for 2 min and suspended in 1 ml of f/2 liquid medium. Then, the tissue suspension was serially diluted and incubated on f/2 agar plates supplemented with antibiotics (50 g/ml of kanamycin, 100 g/ml of ampicillin, and 50 g/ml of streptomycin) (21) at 24°C and a light intensity of 50 mol photons m Ϫ2 s Ϫ1 on a 14-h:10-h light/dark cycle for 30 days. The grown colonies were subsequently incubated in f/2 liquid medium without antibiotics at the same conditions described above and subcultured every 30 to 50 days until the start of the experimental trials. A photon sensor (DEFI2-L; JFE Advantech, Nishinomiya, Japan) was used to measure light intensity. All of the Symbiodiniaceae isolates were identified as Durusdinium (formerly Symbiodinium clade D) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(46)</ref> based on the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(47)</ref>.</p><p>Manipulation of the bacterial community of Symbiodiniaceae. The bacterial community of Symbiodiniaceae was perturbed by incubating an algal culture for 2 months in f/2 liquid medium supplemented with the antibiotic cocktail described above. To isolate a bacterium from the cultured Symbiodiniaceae, the algal suspension was serially diluted and spread on marine agar plates (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). After incubation at 25°C for 5 days, a colony showing orange pigmentation was isolated, purified, and named GF1. The antibiotic-treated Symbiodiniaceae (ϳ10 5 cells) were inoculated with ϳ10 6 CFU of GF1 and cultured in the absence of antibiotics for at least 3 months to stabilize the association with Symbiodiniaceae before being used in subsequent experiments.</p><p>16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and data analysis. Symbiodiniaceae cells were harvested via centrifugation at 8,000 ϫ g for 5 min and immediately stored at Ϫ80°C until processing. The total DNAs were extracted using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The variable region V1/V2 of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the primers 8F-overhang (5=-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGAGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3=) and 338R-overhang (5=-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3=). PCR amplifications were performed in a final volume of 25 l, containing 12.5 l of KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, 0.75 l of each primer (10 M), and 3 ng of template DNA. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturing at 95°C for 4 min and then 23 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 55°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 15 s, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 4 min. The amplicons were subsequently indexed using the Nextera XT Index kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced on the Illumina Miseq platform using 2 ϫ 250-bp paired-end v2 chemistry.</p><p>For the taxonomic analysis, the forward reads were cropped to 240 bp using Trimmomatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(48)</ref> and subsequently processed with the QIIME pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>. Briefly, low-quality reads with a Qscore of less than 20 and chimeric sequences were discarded. The surviving sequences (ranging from 27,314 to 100,687 reads per sample) were then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and classified using the Greengenes database via open-reference OTU picking with the default parameters (see <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> in the supplemental material). The bacterial community composition and weighted UniFrac distances were calculated after removing the OTUs assigned to chloroplasts.</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis of GF1. Genomic DNA was isolated from GF1 grown on marine agar plates using the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue kit (Qiagen). The 16S rRNA gene of GF1 was PCR-amplified using KOD FX Neo (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) and the primers 8F (5=-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3=) and 1492R (5=-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3=) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturing at 94°C for 2 min and then 30 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 80 s, followed by a final extension at 68°C for 3 min. The 16S rRNA gene of GF1 was sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany). Other bacterial sequences were obtained through EzBioCloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(50)</ref>. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the 16S rRNA sequences via the neighbor-joining method (bootstrap of 1,000 replicates) using Clustal X (http://www.clustal.org/).</p><p>Stress challenges and physiological assessment. Symbiodiniaceae cells were acclimatized in 5 ml f/2 medium in a 14-ml round-bottom tube (352059; Corning, Corning, NY, USA) under the same culture conditions described above for at least 5 days before stress exposure. For the heat stress challenge, Symbiodiniaceae cells at an initial cell density of 10 cells/ml were exposed to thermal (31.5°C) or nonthermal (24°C) stress at a light intensity of 50 mol photons m Ϫ2 s Ϫ1 . For the light stress experiment, the Symbiodiniaceae cells were incubated at 24°C under light (200 mol photons m Ϫ2 s Ϫ1 ) or nonlight (50 mol photons m Ϫ2 s Ϫ1 ) stress. The F v /F m was measured from the bottom of the tubes using a pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorometer (Junior-PAM; Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) after the algal cultures had been dark adapted for 30 min. To quantify the ROS production in the algal cultures, 195 l of algal suspension was incubated with 5 l of 2=,7=-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide) in a 96-well plate for ϳ30 min in darkness, followed by measurement of the fluorescence intensity (excitation at 485 nm and emission at 527 nm) using a microplate fluorometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The data were represented as relative fluorescence normalized by algal cell numbers after subtracting the fluorescence intensity in f/2 medium without algal cells.</p><p>Genome sequencing and analysis of GF1. A sequencing library was prepared from the genomic DNA of GF1 using the Nextera DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol and sequenced on the Illumina Miseq platform using 2 ϫ 150-bp paired-end v2 chemistry. The raw sequencing reads were filtered using fastp (version 0.20.0) (51) with the default parameters and subsequently de novo assembled using SPAdes (version 3.13.1) (52) with the parameters "-careful" and "-cov-cutoff auto." The assembled genome was annotated using the RAST server (version 2.0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(53)</ref>. All of the coding sequences and annotation information are listed in <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>. The zeaxanthin biosynthesis pathway was confirmed based on the RAST and KAAS annotators <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(54)</ref>.</p><p>Metabolite analysis. Pigments were extracted from ϳ10 mg wet cell weight of GF1 grown on marine agar plates with methanol using a Bioruptor UCD-250 sonicator (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) for 10 s. The LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using LC (Nexera System; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LCMS-8060; Shimadzu). The samples were separated by an InertSustain AQ-C 18 column (150 mm by 2.1 mm inside diameter [i.d.] and 1.9-m particle size; GL Sciences, Osaka, Japan) at a column temperature of 35°C. The mobile phase comprised 90% (vol/vol) methanol containing 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Electrospray ionization was performed at 4 kV, with the positive mode at 250°C in the desolvation line and 300°C in the interface. Nebulizing and drying gases were set at flow rates of 2 and 10 liters/min, respectively. Data acquisition was performed based on the MRM mode <ref type="table">(Table S1)</ref>, and the zeaxanthin abundance was determined on the basis of the peak area of the transition from m/z 568.30 to 476.35. A zeaxanthin standard was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.</p><p>Zeaxanthin addition experiments. A stock solution of zeaxanthin (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. After acclimation under nonstressful conditions (24°C, 50 mol photons m Ϫ2 s Ϫ1 ) for 5 days, the Abx algal culture was exposed to either thermal stress (31.5°C, 50 mol photons m Ϫ2 s Ϫ1 ) for 6 days or light stress (24°C, 200 mol photons m Ϫ2 s Ϫ1 ) for 1 day to induce oxidative damage. Subsequently, the Abx algal culture was supplemented with zeaxanthin to a final concentration of 0.1 or 1 g/ml and incubated for 2 days under the same stressful conditions followed by F v /F m and ROS production measurements as described above.</p><p>Colony-forming assays. Colony-forming assays were performed to estimate the zeaxanthin production by GF1 in AbxϩGF1 algal cultures. Algal cultures before and after stress exposure were serially diluted in f/2 medium and spread on marine agar plates to form 30 to 100 bacterial colonies. The numbers of colonies were counted after incubation at 25°C for 6 days.</p><p>FISH analysis. All procedures were performed according to the method described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(55)</ref>. In brief, algal samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako, Osaka Japan), spotted on an aminosilanecoated glass slide (Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan), and air-dried, followed by successive dehydration in 50%, 80%, and 100% ethanol. The samples were hybridized with a CF319a probe (5=-TGGTCCGTGTCTC AGTAC-3=) labeled with the fluorophore FAM (Eurofins Genomics) in a hybridization buffer (35% formamide, 0.9 M NaCl, mM Tris-HCl, and 0.01% SDS) at 46°C for 2 h. After being washed with a washing buffer (0.08 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.01% SDS), the samples were counterstained with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) and observed under a confocal microscope (LSM 700; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).</p><p>Isolation of bacteria from corals. The G. fascicularis colonies were fragmented to obtain single polyps and centrifuged at 100 ϫ g for 10 s in a 1.5-ml tube to remove surface-associated seawater. The tissues of the polyps were harvested via further centrifugation at 8,000 ϫ g for 2 min and homogenized in marine broth (BD Biosciences). The coral tissue suspensions were serially diluted and spread on marine agar plates to form 30 to 100 bacterial colonies. Among the colonies formed during the 10-day incubation at 25°C, those showing orange pigmentation similar to that of GF1 were directly subjected to PCR amplifications as described above. The amplified 16S rRNA genes of the bacteria were then sequenced (Eurofins Genomics) and compared with that of GF1.</p><p>Genome analysis of a closely related alphaproteobacterium. To isolate an alphaproteobacterium from the cultured Symbiodiniaceae, the Abx algal culture was spread on a marine agar plate. After incubation at 25°C for 10 days, a white colony was isolated and incubated at 98°C for 5 min in ultrapure water to extract DNA. After centrifugation at 14,000 ϫ g for 1 min, the supernatant was used as a DNA template for PCR using 8F and 1492R primers. The amplified 16S rRNA gene was sequenced (Eurofins Genomics). The sequence was identical to the representative sequence of OTU1 <ref type="table">(Table S3)</ref>.</p><p>To infer the functional roles of the alphaproteobacterium, the genome sequence of a closely related strain, alpha proteobacterium Mf 1.05b.01, was downloaded from NCBI (NZ_BAOK00000000.1) (20) and annotated using the RAST server <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(53)</ref>. All of the coding sequences and annotation information are listed in <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>. The presence of the vitamin B biosynthesis pathway was confirmed according to the RAST and KAAS annotators <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(54)</ref>.</p><p>Data availability. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under accession number PRJNA514199. The 16S rRNA gene of GF1 was deposited in GenBank under accession number MK391175. The GF1 genome sequencing data were deposited in GenBank under accession number PRJNA588666.

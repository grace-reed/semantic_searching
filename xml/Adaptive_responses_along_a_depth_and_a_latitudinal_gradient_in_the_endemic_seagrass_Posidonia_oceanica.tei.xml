			<abstract>
				<p>Seagrass meadows provide important ecosystem services and are critical for the survival of the associated invertebrate community. However, they are threatened worldwide by human-driven environmental change. Understanding the seagrasses&apos; potential for adaptation is critical to assess not only their ability to persist under future global change scenarios, but also to assess the persistence of the associated communities. Here we screened a wild population of Posidonia oceanica, an endemic long-lived seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea, for genes that may be target of environmental selection, using an outlier and a genome-wide transcriptome analysis. We identified loci where polymorphism or differential expression was associated with either a latitudinal or a bathymetric gradient, as well as with both gradients in an effort to identify loci associated with temperature and light. We found the candidate genes underlying growth and immunity to be divergent between populations adapted to different latitudes and/or depths, providing evidence for local adaptation. Furthermore, we found evidence of reduced gene flow among populations including adjacent populations. Reduced gene flow, combined with low sexual recombination, small effective population size, and long generation time of P. oceanica raises concerns for the long-term persistence of this species, especially in the face of rapid environmental change driven by human activities.</p>

However, because of the complex interplay among temperature and other environmental stressors, it remains a challenge to disentangle the impact of temperature stress from one or the other environmental factors.</p><p>Here we investigated local adaptation of populations of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica sampled along a latitudinal and a bathymetric gradient, using a genome scan and a These authors contributed equally: Gabriele Procaccini, Luisa Orsini transcriptome analysis. Temperature and light are key environmental factors varying along these gradients; in particular, light is strongly associated with the bathymetric gradient. We hypothesized that a signature of local adaptation shared between the bathymetric and the latitudinal gradient reflects adaptation to temperature, while a signature of local adaptation associated with the bathymetric gradient primarily reflects adaptation to light cues. To test these hypotheses, we mined for outlier loci that are uniquely associated with the bathymetric or latitudinal gradient, as well as for shared outlier loci between the gradients. Furthermore, we performed a genome-wide differential expression analysis to identify candidate genes and gene pathways associated with the bathymetric gradient.</p><p>Seagrass meadows are one among the most valuable ecosystems on earth, as they are important providers of ecosystem services and sustain many invertebrate and vertebrate communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Costanza et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Giakoumi et al. 2015)</ref>. Understanding how seagrasses respond to environmental change is critical not only to assess their ability to persist to future global change, but also to assess the persistence of the associated communities. The seagrass P. oceanica (L.) Delile is an endemic long-lived seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea. Individual shoots of this plant survive for decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Short et al. 2011)</ref>, and grow via horizontal rhizome elongation (1-10 cm per year; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Marbà and Duarte 1998)</ref>. Single genotypes can persist for millennia via asexual reproduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arnaud-Haond et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ruggiero et al. 2002)</ref>. Flowering via sexual reproduction is extremely heterogeneous at spatial and temporal scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Diaz-Almela et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jahnke et al. 2015a)</ref>. Moreover, the establishment success of flowers is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Balestri and Cinelli 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Diaz-Almela et al. 2006)</ref>. P. oceanica populations in the Mediterranean Sea show pronounced genetic structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Serra et al. 2010)</ref> with reduced gene flow both across latitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Procaccini et al. 2002)</ref> and depths <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Migliaccio et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Procaccini et al. 2001)</ref>. Low genetic diversity has been observed at regional and global scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Serra et al. 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, low genetic and genotypic diversity have been associated with local or regional extinctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jahnke et al. 2015b)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling design</head><p>We collected P. oceanica populations from six localities in the Mediterranean Sea along a latitudinal (1000 km, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) and a bathymetric gradient. Each locality was sampled at two depths (5 and 20-25 m) <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>). Average sea surface temperature (SST) records from the last three decades were provided by Copernicus (SST_MED_SST_L4_RE-P_OBSERVATIONS_010_021_a_1438858783944) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Nardelli et al. 2013)</ref>. Using these records, we calculated the average temperature differences among populations <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table  S2</ref>). Historical records show differences of up to 10°C between the two sampled depths, in particular when vertical mixing is prevented by the presence of the summer  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Posidonia oceanica  was sampled from six  geographic locations in the  Mediterranean Sea along a  latitudinal transect of 1000 km at  two different depths (5 and  20-25 m)</ref> thermocline <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Marin-Guirao et al. 2016</ref>). This temperature difference is less pronounced in winter. For one of the sampled locations <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Stareso, Table S1</ref>), the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) was recorded at the time of sampling (1 pm), and corresponded to 430 and 92 μmol m −2 s −1 at 5 and 20 m, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Procaccini et al. 2017)</ref>. Comparable differences in irradiance between depths can be expected at the other sampled locations. However, PAR data are not available for all locations.</p><p>At each site and from each depth, between 20 and 31 adult leaves of P. oceanica were sampled nondestructively <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>). The mean distance between the samples at each site ranged between 5 and 8 m to reduce the chance of collecting identical clones <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Serra et al. 2010)</ref>. After collection, the leaves were cleaned from epiphytes and stored in silica gel prior to DNA extraction. All samples were genotyped at 23 putatively neutral microsatellite loci, 14 of which were EST-linked <ref type="table">(Table S3</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alberto et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Arranz et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Migliaccio et al. 2005, Procaccini and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Waycott 1998)</ref>.</p><p>The Stareso population (Corse, 8°45′E,42°35′N, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) was previously used to generate a reference transcriptome for P. oceanica <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(D'Esposito et al. 2016</ref>). Here we used the available RNA-Seq data to identify differentially expressed genes between the shallow and deep stands of the same population. As samples were collected at two timepoints within the same day (12 noon and 6.30 p.m.), we also studied plastic response in genome-wide expression in response to light by identifying differential gene expression between the samples collected from the same depth at different timepoints. At the time of sampling, sunrise was at 7.25 a.m. and sunset was at 6.45 p.m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population response to environmental changeoutlier analysis</head><p>DNA was extracted from 271 samples (ca. 20 mg of dried tissue per sample) collected from the six localities at two depths <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>) using the NucleoSpin ® 96 Plant II kit (Macherey-Nagel), following a modified protocol optimized for a Biomek FX robotic station <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Tomasello et al. 2009)</ref>. Genotyping was performed using an ABI Prism 3730 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems), following PCR amplification with the following cycling: 95°C for 15 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 1 min 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension step of 60°C for 30 min. Only samples that were successfully genotyped at ≥90% of the loci (22/24 loci) were used for downstream analyses.</p><p>Although the likelihood of sampling the same genotype was low due to our sampling design, we screened for the presence of identical multilocus genotypes (MLGs) using the psex (F IS ) (the probability that the repeated genotypes originate from distinct sexual reproductive events considering departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) in GenClone <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arnaud-Haond and Belkhir 2007)</ref>. When identical MLGs were detected, only one was retained within each site for downstream analyses. Our data-set comprised distinct genotypes (18-22 per population, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>). All genotyped populations were used in an outlier analysis to identify the loci putatively associated with latitudinal and depth gradients. We contrasted pairwise populations at the extreme of the latitudinal gradient. In addition, we contrasted stands of the same population sampled at 5 and 25 m. Prior to this analysis, we performed a population genetic structure analysis, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Orsini et al. (2012)</ref>. Specifically, we performed an analysis of population genetic differentiation in Arlequin3.5 with 10,000 permutations (Excoffier and Lischer 2010) and a population genetic structure analysis using a discriminant analysis of principal component (DAPC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jombart et al. 2010)</ref> to identify the number of independent populations present in the dataset. We performed the DAPC implemented in Adegenet <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jombart 2008)</ref> in R 3.2.2. (R Development Core Team 2012) using eight principal components, as suggested by the a-score optimization analysis. The analysis of population differentiation and the genetic discrimination identified a northern and a southern population cluster, and identified as independent populations stands of the same populations sampled at different depths <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. This separation is also evident from the genetic differentiation analysis <ref type="table">(Table S4)</ref>. Hence, for downstream analysis, we considered populations from the same locality at different depths as independent, and grouped the populations along the latitudinal transect into a northern and a southern group.</p><p>To identify the loci putatively linked to environmental factors, we used multiple pairwise population comparisons. This approach has been previously shown to reduce the number of false positives, by showing parallel patterns of locus-specific variation among replicate population comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Orsini et al. 2012)</ref>. To identify loci associated with the depth gradient, we contrasted the stands of the same population at different depths and a pool of all shallow versus all deep stands <ref type="table">(Table S5</ref>). To identify loci associated with the latitudinal gradient, we performed pairwise population comparisons separately for the shallow and deep stands. For this analysis, we contrasted three random population pairs from the northern and the southern groups, as well as the pool of northern versus southern populations at the two depths <ref type="table">(Table S6)</ref>. With this approach, we were able to identify putative outlier loci shared between the bathymetric and latitudinal gradients, as well as outlier loci unique to either gradient. The outlier analysis was conducted with Lositan <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Antao et al. 2008)</ref> and BayeScan <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Foll and Gaggiotti 2008)</ref>. To obtain Lositan results, we run simulations for 50,000 iterations and used a 95% confidence interval. We performed the BayeScan analysis with default settings and used the provided R script to identify loci, that show significant deviation from expectations under neutrality, by plotting their posterior distribution. Using a conservative approach to reduce false positives <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Orsini et al. 2012)</ref>, we plotted the number of times loci were detected as outliers in the pairwise population comparisons. To decide on the minimum threshold needed to define an outlier as a locus potentially under selection, we plotted the frequency with which every locus was detected as an outlier in pairwise analyses of population comparisons. Loci falling outside the 95% boundaries of this frequency distribution were considered as "real" outliers. Loci present only in comparisons from the bathymetric or latitudinal gradient are hereafter referred to as "bathymetric loci" and "latitude loci", respectively. Loci common to the two gradients are referred to as "gradient-shared loci".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association of neutral and non-neutral genetic variation with the environment</head><p>The outlier analysis allowed us to distinguish neutral from putatively non-neutral loci. These two categories of loci were used in a correlative analysis with temperature and geographic distance. For this correlative analysis, we used the following categories of loci: (1) strictly neutral (not identified as outliers in any of the gradients); (2) gradientshared; (3) latitude loci; and (4) bathymetric loci. On these four categories of loci, we measured the partitioning of molecular variance via AMOVA with GenAlEx 6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2012), using 1000 permutations. Three hierarchical levels were used: (a) depth (populations at two depths) or latitude (North and South populations, separately for shallow and deep stands); (b) populations within groups, where the groups were either populations at the same depth or at the same latitude; and (c) individuals within populations.</p><p>The allele frequencies of loci calculated by shallow and deeps stands, as well as by northern and southern populations are listed in <ref type="table">Table S7</ref>.</p><p>We used ArcGIS 10.1 ® (ESRI) to extract the SST values for our sampling locations, and measured geographic distances between sampling locations using the shortest path over the sea without crossing land. We performed a multiple matrix regression with randomization analysis (MMRR) (Wang 2013), using R to identify the correlations between genetic distance (measured as F ST at both neutral and outlier loci), geographic distance, and temperature (measured as the difference between locations of averaged temperature between 1981 and 2012, the period for which SST is available). MMRR uses a randomized permutation procedure to correct for possible dependency between geographic distance and environmental variables. As compared to a classic partial Mantel test, this method reduces type I errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Wang 2013)</ref>. We used 10,000 permutations to test for significant correlations among the standardized matrices of genetic distance, geographic distance, and temperature for shallow populations only, as only superficial SST temperatures were available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional annotation of outlier loci</head><p>The sequences of outlier loci associated with the gradients were used for functional annotations after masking for low complexity regions, which improves gene homology searches. The annotation was done by blasting the sequence of the outlier loci in the NCBI databank and against the reference transcriptome of P. oceanica (D'Esposito et al. 2016) using blastx <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Altschul et al. 1997)</ref>, followed by function query in the EMBL-EBI Pfam database <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bateman et al. 2004)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association of neutral and non-neutral genetic variation with the environment</head><p>The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed on four categories of loci: (1) strictly neutral (not identified as outliers in any of the gradients); (2) gradientshared; (3) latitude loci; and (4) bathymetric loci. Overall, the molecular variance showed different patterns for neutral and outlier loci ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). The proportion of molecular variance for all four sets of loci was highest at withinpopulation level <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1</ref>).

For these loci, the among-groups variance was small yet significant ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).

Geographic distance correlated significantly with SST (p-value = 0.03).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Population response to environmental changeevolutionary and plastic differences in gene expression</head><p>The genome-wide differential expression analysis was conducted on stands of the Stareso population. This analysis identified a total of 2059 differentially expressed genes between stands, of which 1565 were upregulated and 494 were downregulated <ref type="table">(Table S8</ref>). Variability in gene expression was high (BVC = 38%) among samples. The MDS plot following this analysis revealed a clear separation between shallow and deep stands; moreover, it clustered the samples from same depth <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S1)</ref>.</p><p>A large proportion of the differentially expressed genes identified by the DESeq2 analysis belonged to five functional categories: transcription factors (TF), metabolic genes, cell wall remodeling, and signaling pathways <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>, <ref type="table">Table S8</ref>). The remainder of the differentially expressed genes not falling in these functional categories is listed in <ref type="table">Table S8</ref> and includes a number of uncharacterized proteins. Generally, the two deep samples (taken from the same location but at two different times: 12 noon and 6.30 pm) showed higher similarity than the two shallow samples in the number of expressed genes and the direction of change in expression ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3)</ref>. Differences in genome-wide gene expression between shallow and deep stands were mainly associated with constitutive differential expression of basichelix-loop-helix (bLHL), cell wall genes, and MYB ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> and <ref type="table">Table S8</ref>).</p><p>A total of 121 TF were identified in our analysis, falling into four main functional domains, WRKY, MYB, bHLH, and ethylene-responsive genes. MYB and bHLH were largely upregulated in the shallow stand, whereas WRKY TF were largely upregulated in the deep stand <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. The TF identified in our analysis have diverse biological functions ranging from disease resistance, abiotic and biotic stress response, senescence, development, differentiation, and metabolism <ref type="table">(Table S6</ref>). In particular, bHLH is a DNAbinding protein involved in flavonoid biosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hichri et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Phenylpropanoids-coding, flavonoid biosynthesis-coding, and lignin biosynthesis-coding genes were highly represented in the differential expression analysis <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>, <ref type="table">Table S8</ref>). In the phenylpropanoid pathway, we identified genes coding for cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4coumarate-coenzyme-A-ligase enzyme (4CL) ( <ref type="table">Table S8</ref>). In the flavonoid biosynthesis pathways, we identified genes coding for chalcone isomerase (CHI) and chalcone synthase (CHS), dihydroflavonol-4-reductase, flavanone-3-hydroxylase, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, and anthocyanidin reductase. In the lignin biosynthesis pathway, we identified innamic-acid-4-hydroxylase, 4-coumarate-CoA-ligase, shikimate-O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, caffeoylshikimate esterase, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, and shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase <ref type="table">(Table S8)</ref>.</p><p>Most of the transcripts involved in secondary metabolism and cell wall remodeling were upregulated in the shallow population <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3, Table S8</ref>). Among the genes involved in cell wall remodeling, we identified genes coding for xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XET), expansins, and cellulose synthase. Finally, genes involved in phosphorylation or dephosphorylation were the fourth most abundant category retrieved in our analysis. A large proportion of phosphatases was upregulated in the shallow population <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We investigated natural populations of P. oceanica with the aim of identifying signature of natural selection in response to key environmental factors varying along latitude and depth, such as light and temperature. Our Multiple matrix regression with randomization analysis MMRR showing correlations between geographic distance (measured between sampling locations using the shortest path over the sea without crossing land), genetic distance (measured as F ST at microsatellite loci), and environmental distance (measured as the difference between locations of averaged temperature between 1981 and 2012). Significant p-values are in italics.</p><p>hypothesis testing was that loci shared between the bathymetric and latitudinal gradient were candidates for adaptive responses to temperature, a factor common to the two gradients. Conversely, loci associated with the bathymetric gradient were likely associated with adaptation to different light regimes. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> Gene expression analysis. Heatmaps of differentially expressed genes (DEseq p-adj &lt; 0.01) between the deep and the shallow stands of the Stareso population grouped in functional categories. a basic/helix-loophelix (bHLH), b cell wall, c kinases, d MYB, e phosphatases, f secondary metabolism, g WRKY. S1 and S2-shallow stand sampled at 12 noon and 6.30 pm, respectively; D1 and D2-deep stand sampled at 12 noon and 6.30 p.m., respectively. Raw zeta-scores were calculated from the DESeq2 normalized counts</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">A C E G H F D B</formula><p>The candidate loci identified in the outlier analysis and shared between the bathymetric and latitudinal gradient include a ribosomal protein (Pooc-047G07, 50S ribosomal protein L35) and a lipid transfer protein 3 (Pooc-50, pEARLI1-like lipid transfer protein 3), whose functions are potentially associated with both temperature and photoperiod. L35 is a structural constituent of the ribosomes, and is among the cellular proteins differentially regulated under stressful conditions (see review <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kosová et al. 2018)</ref>. In bacteria, L35 is commonly downregulated under thermal stress (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Nevarez et al. 2008)</ref>. Although mechanisms of stress response differ among taxa, L35 may be potentially involved in stress response in P. oceanica. The protein pEARL1-like lipid transfer protein 3 is a member of the proline-rich protein (PRP) family, which has multiple functions in plants: (i) regulation of flowering time and lignin synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Shi et al. 2011)</ref>; (ii) protection of the plasma membrane and cell wall against low temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Zhang and Schläppi 2007)</ref>; (iii) and resistance to fungal infection. Relevant to our findings is that EARL1 can be activated by temperature and changes in photoperiod <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bubier and Schläppi 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Other candidate loci associated with the bathymetric and latitudinal gradients include the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-1 (Pooc-PCo45G11) and a plant pathogen protein (Pooc-PC003H09). Translation initiation factors have been shown to play a fundamental role in growth and development of plants by regulating cell division, cell growth, and cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Feng et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hopkins et al. 2008)</ref>. Plant pathogenesis-related proteins, such as the PR-1, identified here, are highly expressed in plants after infections and act as an anti-fungal agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Van Loon et al. 2006)</ref>. Interestingly, the translation initiation factor 5A-1 is involved in regulation of cellular processes underlying both plant development and programmed cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hopkins et al. 2008)</ref>, and in response to heat stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Xu et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The number of loci used in the outlier analysis was small, hence we had limited power in identifying shared-loci between gradients. A genome-wide polymorphism analysis will likely alleviate the limitations of the current study. Overall, the candidate genes identified in the current study regulate central metabolism and cell functions, such as growth and development or are associated with pathogens response. Hence, they do not have a direct link to light or temperature. However, since the link between temperature and metabolism in the context of climate change is wellrecognized <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tewksbury et al. 2008)</ref>, the candidate genes identified here may be indirectly linked to temperature. For example, cell wall hardening has been suggested to alleviate heat stress in P. oceanica <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Marín-Guirao et al. 2017)</ref>, as well as in other seagrass species (e.g. Z. marina) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Franssen et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jueterbock et al. 2016)</ref>. Follow-up experiments under controlled laboratory conditions are required to establish a causal association between the putative candidate genes identified here and temperature.</p><p>We observed significant divergence in genome-wide gene expression between shallow and deep stands of the Stareso population. Furthermore, we observed a significantly larger divergence between the two shallow than between the two deep samples. Divergence in genome-wide gene expression between shallow and deep stands is likely explained by evolutionary differences in basal gene expression, whereas differences in gene expression between samples collected from the same depth suggests plastic responses to changing irradiance and temperature. Irradiance measured at the Stareso site was markedly different between the two sampling times. Recent studies support the notion that P. oceanica living along the bathymetric gradient have differential resilience and are locally adapted to their local environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dattolo et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Marin-Guirao et al. 2016)</ref>. Shallow populations of P. oceanica show faster and higher induction of heat-response gene, a potential form of local adaptation to higher temperature regimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Marin-Guirao et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Differentially expressed genes between depths were enriched for flavonoid biosynthesis-coding and lignin biosynthesis-coding genes. These are metabolism-linked genes responsible for a wide range of biochemical pathways, providing plants with secondary metabolites (Weisshaar and Jenkins 1998). Also enriched were genes involved in cell wall loosening. These latter genes were generally upregulated in the shallow stand and downregulated in the deep stand, suggesting that bathymetric pressure affects the populations of P. oceanica studied here. Finally, the differentially regulated genes between depths included lignin-coding genes, the second most abundant component of plant cell walls, as well as xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XET), expansins, and cellulose synthase. These genes are commonly associated with cell wall remodeling.</p><p>A clear genetic structure was observed both among stands of the same population and among populations. In addition to clear population genetic structure, we observed significant population differentiation (F ST ), confirming reduced gene flow among populations. The population genetic structure was not explained by geographic distance, as neither neutral nor non-neutral genetic variation were significantly correlated with geographic distance (no isolation by distance, IBD). These findings were in line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dattolo et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Serra et al. 2010)</ref>. Conversely, neutral genetic variation was significantly correlated with temperature. The patterns of correlation observed here can be explained by a scenario of isolation by colonization <ref type="bibr">(IBC,Orsini et al. 2013)</ref>, determined by the genetic pattern of early colonization and fueled by low establishment success of immigrants. This scenario is supported by observations of limited gene flow among meadows <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jahnke et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Serra et al. 2010)</ref> and high levels of clonal reproduction in P. oceanica <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arnaud-Haond et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Serra et al. 2010</ref>). An IBC scenario agrees with the concept of the "founder takes all" put forward by <ref type="bibr">Water et al. (2013)</ref>. The "founders takes all" scenario suggests that density-dependent processes are likely important in constraining dispersal in the marine environment and play a key role in determining local genetic structure, even in highly connected ecosystems that would otherwise promote panmixia <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Waters et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, the observed population genetic differentiation observed in our study can be explained by endogenous selection on intrinsic genetic incompatibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bierne et al. 2011)</ref>. High genetic structure and low gene flow among populations of P. oceanica may be indicative of hybrid fitness depression or endogenous selection against migrants <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bierne et al. 2002)</ref>. Laboratory crosses and fitness analysis across multiple generations is required to validate this hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The candidate genes associated with depth and/or latitude underpin central metabolic, cell remodeling, and immunoregulation functions. Given the demonstrated link between metabolism and temperature, most of the assessed genes may be indirectly associated with temperature response. Moreover, some of the candidate genes associated with both gradients have been previously linked to temperature and/or light.</p><p>The analysis of genome-wide differential gene expression clearly identified divergence in basal expression of five protein functional categories. This divergence is likely explained by adaptation to the local environment. Evidence for reduced gene flow among populations and among stands of the same population at different depths combined with low sexual recombination, small effective population size, and long generation time of P. oceanica pose concerns for the long-term persistence of this species, especially in the face of rapid environmental change driven by human activities. These concerns are supported by a recent metaanalysis suggesting that P. oceanica meadows with low genetic and genotypic diversity are unable to persist in highly impacted areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jahnke et al. 2015b)</ref>.</p></div>

			<abstract>
				<p>Antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) are widely distributed in nature. In higher eukaryotes, AMPs provide the host with an important defence mechanism against invading pathogens. AMPs of lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes may support successful competition for nutrients with other microorganisms of the same ecological niche. AMPs show a vast variety in structure, function, antimicrobial spectrum and mechanism of action. Most interestingly, there is growing evidence that AMPs also fulfil important biological functions other than antimicrobial activity. The present review focuses on the mechanistic function of small, cationic, cysteine-rich AMPs of mammals, insects, plants and fungi with antifungal activity and specifically aims at summarizing current knowledge concerning additional biological properties which opens novel aspects for their future use in medicine, agriculture and biotechnology.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Small proteins with antimicrobial activity, so called antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), are produced by organisms throughout all kingdoms comprising prokaryotes, lower and higher eukaryotes. AMPs are secreted proteins that efficiently inhibit the growth of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. In unicellular organisms, AMPs might provide their hosts the advantage to successfully compete with organisms that possess similar nutritional and ecological requirements. In multicellular organisms, AMPs constitute a primitive mechanism of innate immunity and form the first line of defence to protect their hosts from microbial attack. The innate immunity represents an evolutionarily ancient and widespread defence mechanism found in plants, insects and vertebrates. In addition, vertebrates developed the adaptive immune system e a sophisticated mechanism that uses antibodies and killer cells to recognize and eliminate invading microorganisms and allows immunological memory and self versus non-self recognition. The innate immune response is fast, and complements the adaptive immunity. Thus, both mechanisms combine to form an optimal and efficient defence system that supports the fitness of the host. The fact that closely related AMPs are widely distributed over different eukaryotic kingdoms, i.e. the class of defensins, suggests that ancestral AMP genes existed in basal eukaryotes even before fungal and insect lineages diverged <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Lehrer and Ganz, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Lehrer, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Zhu, 2008)</ref>. AMPs are gene-encoded and they are either constitutively expressed or rapidly transcribed upon induction. In higher eukaryotes invading microbes and their products, e.g. lipopolysaccharides <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Mendez-Samperio et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Amlie-Lefond et al., 2005)</ref>, or host cellular compounds, such as butyrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Murakami et al., 2002)</ref>, cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Wolk et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Wilson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lai and Gallo, 2009)</ref>, and vitamins <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Schauber et al., 2006)</ref> stimulate AMP production.</p><p>Due to the vast variety in function, structure, expression pattern, target organisms and producing hosts, the classification of AMPs is difficult and somewhat arbitrary to date. Mostly, AMPs are classified according to their functional and/or structural properties. Both characteristics are determined by the primary sequence of the protein which very often shows a high number of certain amino acids such as glycine, cysteine, histidine, proline, tyrosine, arginine, lysine and serine.</p><p>Although only a defined number of AMPs has been structurally analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), calorimetric dichroism (CD) or X-ray crystallography, the secondary and tertiary structure of numerous AMPs has been predicted from primary sequence homologies. The most common classes contain proteins with a-helical, b-sheet or mixed ahelical/b-sheet structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Zhu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dimarcq et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Giangaspero et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Tossi et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The best functionally characterized AMPs are bactericidal, whereas the properties of antifungal AMPs and their mode-ofaction are less well studied. In the online database of AMPs at http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/main.php around 1900 AMPs of different origin are registered. From these, more than 1500 AMPs (79 %) have been assigned antibacterial activity compared to 648 antifungal AMPs (34 %). This classification, however, is redundant and antibacterial AMPs may also show antifungal activity that has not been investigated so far.</p><p>Most interestingly, the number of reports that document new additional functions of AMPs beyond their antimicrobial activity is constantly increasing. These features might arise from signalling functions of AMPs that accompany the activity of AMPs to interfere with the cell proliferation of microbes. For example, antimicrobial peptides from bacteria are part of the quorum-sensing mechanism that helps microorganisms to communicate and co-ordinate their behaviour by accumulating signalling molecules in the extracellular environment. This microbial communication system regulates e.g. symbiosis, biofilm formation, conjugation, sporulation, virulence, motility and the production of various secondary metabolites <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Raina et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Maroti et al., 2011)</ref>. In fungi, plants and insects, AMPs have been related to development and differentiation <ref type="bibr">(Stotz et al., 2009a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Eigentler et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Hegedus et al., 2011a)</ref>, symbiotic interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Maroti et al., 2011)</ref> and root hair extension <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Allen et al., 2008)</ref>.

Two general models try to explain the mechanism of antimicrobial action of defensins: (A) the permeabilization of the cell membrane by (i) the carpet model and (ii) the pore model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Brogden, 2005)</ref>. Whereas in (i) several protein molecules insert into the membrane forming a pore, in (ii) the protein molecules oligomerize and form a multimeric pore. Both models are primarily based on AMP-bacterial interaction and describe the disintegration of the plasma membrane, cell leakage and cell death by necrosis. (B) Alternatively, the membrane interaction of defensins and defensin-like AMPs may not primarily damage the plasma membrane of target cells. Instead, antifungal protein interaction with specific lipid and/or protein components of the plasma membrane leads to a selective ion permeability of the membrane and to the formation of transient pores and/ or results in (active) protein transport into the host cell where these antifungals interact with intracellular targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Brogden, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Marx et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Thevissen et al., 2003a)</ref>. This antifungal activity increases the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggers programmed cell death (PCD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Leiter et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Aerts et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aerts et al., , 2009</ref>. Thus, plasma membrane leakage could occur at a later time point after protein contact with the fungal cell as a secondary effect of extensive intracellular ROS formation, as proposed for plant defensins <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Thevissen et al., 2003a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Mammalian AMPs</head><p>Among mammalian AMPs, the defensins are best characterized and categorized in three subfamilies, a-, band q-defensins. Whereas the q-defensins were primarily found in primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Schutte et al., 2002)</ref>, aand b-defensins are produced by humans and differ in the position of the disulfide bridges <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Schneider et al., 2005)</ref>. a-defensins are products of neutrophils and Paneth cells of the small intestine <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Mallow et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ganz et al., 1985)</ref> and human b-defensins 1e4 (hBD1, hBD2, hBD3, hBD4) are secreted by epidermal, epithelial and mesenchymal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ali et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Varoga et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Zhao et al., 1996)</ref>. We will focus on this latter defensin group hBD1-4 that shows the closest homology to insect and plant defensins. Six conserved cysteine residues form three disulfide bridges and arrange three antiparallel b-sheets flanked by an a-helical segment <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Pazgier et al., 2006)</ref>. Apart from their toxicity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and viruses, these proteins possess antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Candida parapsilosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Feng et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hoover et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Hazrati et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Sun et al., 2005)</ref>. b-defensins form the first line of defence against microbial infection and link innate with adaptive immunity. They are constitutively expressed or are induced by microbes, cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1) or even by the status of cellular differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Liu et al., 2002)</ref>. Near the site of microbial invasion bdefensins form chemotactic gradients to recruit immature dendritic cells and memory T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Yang et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Yang et al., , 1999</ref>. Immunomodulation is regulated via the Toll signalling pathway. For example, the murine b-defensin 2 (mDF2beta) is an endogenous ligand to the Toll-like receptor 4 and induces dendritic cell maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Biragyn et al., 2002)</ref>. Apart from functions in the immune response, b-defensins regulate other most diverse cellular processes. For example, b-defensins affect sperm function including the initiation of motility and capacitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Tollner et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Yudin et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">Zhou et al., 2004)</ref>. hBD2 activates and triggers the degranulation of mast cells, which results in the release of histamine and prostaglandin D 2 , two messenger molecules that regulate many physiological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Befus et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Niyonsaba et al., 2001)</ref>. hBD2 also stimulates the migration, proliferation and tube formation of endothelial cells in wounds and accelerates wound closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baroni et al., 2009)</ref>. Furthermore, hBD2e4 promote wound healing by supporting the migration and proliferation of keratinocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Niyonsaba et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, human b-defensins also have been associated with the pathogenesis of diseases. For example, hBD2 and hBD3 were originally purified from inflammatory skin disease psoriasis and proinflammatory cytokines induce their transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Harder et al., 2001)</ref>, whereas the loss of hBD1 favours cancer development <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Sun et al., 2006)</ref>. hBD2 has been implicated in Crohn's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Fellermann et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Thus defensins act not only as potent antimicrobial agents, but also as immunological adjuvants, similar to chemokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Salzet, 2002)</ref>, and as signalling molecules which regulate important cellular functions, ultimately contributing to the fitness of the host.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Insect AMPs</head><p>The antibacterial features of insect defensins are well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bulet et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cociancich et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Lehrer and Ganz, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Otvos, 2000)</ref>, whereas the number of antifungal insect defensins comprises only four members which show a high structural relatedness to mammalian and plant defensins: drosomycin from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fehlbaum et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Zhang and Zhu, 2009)</ref>, heliomicin from the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Lamberty et al., 1999)</ref>, termicin from the fungus-growing termites Pseudocanthothermes spiniger and Reticulitermes flavipes <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Lamberty et al., 2001)</ref> and gallerimycin from the greater wax moth larvae Galleria mellonella <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lee et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Schuhmann et al., 2003)</ref>. Most insect AMPs are produced after microbial challenge in the fat body, equivalent to the mammalian liver, and certain haemocytes before they are released into the hemolymph. Only modest information exists on gallerimycin and heliomicin. Gallerimycin has antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and the entomopathogenic fungus Metharhizium anisopliae, but not against yeasts and bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Schuhmann et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Mak et al., 2010)</ref>. Similarly, heliomicin is inactive against bacteria, but toxic against yeasts like C. albicans, Pichia pastoris and Cryptococcus neoformans and filamentous fungi such as Neurospora crassa, Fusarium sp., Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichoderma viridae <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Lamberty et al., 1999)</ref>. In analogy to plant defensins (RsAFP2), heliomicin directly binds to fungal plasma membrane ceramides, i.e. glucosylceramides. Consequently, yeast deletion mutants in the glucosylceramide biosynthesis gene GCS1 were 20-fold less sensitive than the wild-type strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Thevissen et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The mode-of-action of drosomycin and termicin is better described. Although drosomycin is strictly antifungal at micromolar concentrations against filamentous fungi (N. crassa, Fusarium sp., Alternaria sp., Botrytis cinerea) and yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Zhang and Zhu, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Tian et al., 2008)</ref>, bacterial challenge can induce drosomycin gene expression. The systemic gene expression is regulated by the Toll pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Zhang and Zhu, 2009)</ref>. In addition, a local response in epithelia situated in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive tracts can also induce drosomycin expression independently of the Toll pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ferrandon et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Tzou et al., 2000)</ref>, whereby the inducible response in the respiratory tract is controlled by the Immune Deficiency (IMD) pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Zhang and Zhu, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Drosomycin lyses fungal hyphae suggesting a mode-ofaction based on membrane permeabilization and pore formation in susceptible fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Fehlbaum et al., 1994)</ref>. Membrane components, such as sphingolipids, seem to play a central role for the interaction of drosomycin with its target organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gao and Zhu, 2008)</ref>. Indeed, a N. crassa mutant (Mut16) displaying clear differences in sphingolipid composition compared to the wild-type strain, was less susceptible to drosomycin <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Ferket et al., 2003)</ref>. Most interestingly, drosomycin closely interferes with the D. melanogaster voltage-gated sodium channel (DmNa v 1). This observation and the detection of drosomycin transcripts in the Drosophila brain and thoracicabdominal ganglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Jiggins and Kim, 2005)</ref> further support the assumption that drosomycin might act as neuropeptide in the fly's central nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Cohen et al., 2009)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Tian et al. (2008)</ref> discovered for the first time that the antifungal drosomycin also exhibits antiparasitic activity. The observation that drosomycin inhibited the development of the ookinetes of Plasmodium berghei undoubtedly opens a new research field for the design of novel anti-malaria agents.</p><p>The termite antifungal defensin termicin inhibits the growth of the ubiquitous soil and entomopathogenic fungus M. anisopliae <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hamilton et al., 2011)</ref>. The termite Reticulitermes produces termicin together with antifungal glucanases, e.g. the gram-negative bacteria binding protein 2 (GNBP2), which efficiently breaks down b-1,3-glucans of fungal cell walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bulmer et al., 2009)</ref>. Termicin and GNBP2 are constitutively expressed in the salivary gland, stored in reservoirs and constitutively secreted and disseminated by self-and allogrooming. The secretion of termicin and synergistically acting enzymes prevent M. anisopliae from attaching and penetrating the cuticle where it can effectively evade the insect immune defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hamilton and Bulmer, 2012)</ref>. Furthermore, Reticulitermes incorporates termicin and GNBP2 in nest materials that may act as an external recognition system. The release of digested fungal cell wall material may trigger the immune defence of termites that are working in infested areas of their nests or support the accession of foraging grounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bulmer et al., 2009)</ref>. Thus the secretion of antifungal proteins, such as termicin, could have been crucial in overcoming strong pathogenic pressures during social evolution in insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Hamilton and Bulmer, 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Plant AMPs</head><p>The plant defensin family is quite diverse in its primary structure as only eight structure-stabilizing cysteines are conserved among all plant defensins <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Thevissen et al., 2003a)</ref>. Reflecting the structural diversity, plant defensins display most diverse biological activities. Unlike the insect and mammalian defensins, which are mainly active against prokaryotes, only a few plant defensins have been shown to possess antibacterial activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Stotz et al., 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Koike et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Segura et al., 1998)</ref>. Most plant defensins are active against numerous filamentous ascomycetes (Carvalho Ade and Gomes, 2009), including phytopathogenic fungi such as Fusarium graminearum <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Sagaram et al., 2011)</ref>, B. cinerea <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Stotz et al., 2009a)</ref>, and Alternaria brassicicola <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(de Zelicourt et al., 2007)</ref>. Some plant defensins inhibit the growth of baker's yeast and opportunistic human pathogenic fungi such as C. albicans <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Thevissen et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">de Zelicourt et al., 2007)</ref>. Plant defensins are divided into two groups: (i) antifungal activity is accompanied by changes in morphology such as hyperbranching of hyphae; (ii) antifungal activity occurs without hyphal distortions <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Thomma et al., 2002)</ref>. Consequently, it is assumed that differences exist in the mode-of-action of these closely related antifungal proteins. Defensins are expressed by various organs and tissues, e.g. in seeds and in peripheral cell layers of fruits and floral organs, including the style, the ovary and the stamen filaments, of different plants like <ref type="bibr">Arabidopsis (Penninckx et al., 1996)</ref>, pea <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Almeida et al., 2000)</ref>, spinach <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Segura et al., 1998)</ref>, tobacco <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Allen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lay et al., 2003a,b</ref>) and radish <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Terras et al., 1992)</ref>. The peripheral location of plant defensins in different generative tissues reflects their defence role against microbial invasion, either as inducible antimicrobial agents within vegetative tissues or as part of the constitutive defence barriers, especially in storage and reproductive organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Thevissen et al., 2003a</ref>). In addition some defensin genes are systemically induced upon fungal infection or wounding of vegetative tissues such as pI39 and pI230 in pea <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Chiang and Hadwiger, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Among all antifungal defensins, the mode-of-action of plant defensins has been exceptionally well characterized at the molecular level. The following examples are given: the seed defensins DmAMP1 from dahlia (Dahlia merckii) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Osborn et al., 1995)</ref>, RsAFP2 from radish (Raphanus sativus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Terras et al., 1992)</ref>, HsAFP1 from coral bells (Heuchera sanguinea) <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Osborn et al., 1995)</ref>, MsDef1 from alfalfa (Medicago sativa) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Gao et al., 2000)</ref>, MtDef2 from barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Spelbrink et al., 2004)</ref> and Psd1 from pea (Pisum sativum) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Almeida et al., 2000)</ref>. There is growing evidence that excludes a direct interaction of the cationic defensins with the negatively charged phospholipids of the plasma membrane as well as pore formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Thevissen et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Caaveiro et al., 1997)</ref>. Instead, recent data underscore the existence of specific binding domains on the fungal plasma membrane, so called lipid rafts, which are specifically enriched in sphingolipids and sterols and which allow a high local concentration of membrane bound defensins <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Thevissen et al., 2003a)</ref>. For example, DmAMP1 and RsAFP2 interact with sphingolipids of the fungal plasma membrane, DmAMP1 with mannosyldiinositolphosphoryl-ceramide M(IP) C, an acid complex sphingolipid <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Thevissen et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Thevissen et al., , 2005</ref>, and RsAFP2 with a neutral sphingolipid class of glucosylceramides (GlcCer) <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Thevissen et al., 2004)</ref>. Notably, equimolar concentrations of ergosterol and sphingolipids enhance the interaction of DmAMP1, but not of RsAFP2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Thevissen et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Thevissen et al., , 2003b</ref>. Similar binding activities as for RsAFP2 have been proposed for MsDef1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Ramamoorthy et al., 2007a)</ref>. HsAFP1 also interacts with specific, so far unidentified high affinity binding sites on plasma and microsomal membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Thevissen et al., 1997)</ref>. The interaction of DmAMP1 and RsAFP2 with sphingolipid components of the fungal plasma membrane results in an increased Ca 2þ influx and K þ efflux <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Thevissen et al., 1996)</ref>. The question whether fungal growth arrest is a direct consequence of increased membrane permeability or of the interaction of plant defensins with intracellular targets has not been fully answered yet. Nevertheless, existing data suggest that more complex mechanisms than membrane permeabilization are involved in cell death induction. RsAFP2 and HsAFP1 for example, increase the level of intracellular ROS in C. albicans <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aerts et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aerts et al., , 2007</ref> which contributes to the induction of PCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aerts et al., 2008)</ref>. Environmental stress signalling cascades, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway may also be activated <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aerts et al., 2011)</ref>. The Gpmk1 and Mgv1 MAPK signalling were involved in the response to RsAFP2, MsDef1 and MtDef2 in F. graminearum <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aerts et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Ramamoorthy et al., 2007b)</ref>. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen the cell cycle control related protein cyclin F was found to interact with the P. sativum defensin Psd1 and further experiments proved the co-localization of Psd1 with the nucleus and the inhibition of cell division by Psd1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Lobo et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Apart from their antimicrobial defence function, defensins also fulfil other important roles in plant physiology. An exceptionally well researched overview on the complex functions of plant defensins is presented by Carvalho Ade and Gomes (2009). For example, plant defensins mediate resistance against abiotic stress. The Arabidopsis halleri defensin AhPDF1.1 confers zinc-and a slight selenite-tolerance in Arabidopsis sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Oomen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Mirouze et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Tamaoki et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Other features of plant defensins are related to the regulation of growth, development and fertilization. The supplementation of the culture medium with defensins MsDef1, MtDef2, RsAFP2 or AhPDF1.1 inhibits plant root growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Allen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Oomen et al., 2011)</ref>. The Solanum lycopersicon DEF2 is produced during early flower development and promotes meiosis. As such it plays a central role in regulating the growth of different plant organs. During later stages of flower differentiation the inactivation of DEF2 is crucial for survival and development of pollen grains. Consequently, antisense suppression or constitutive overexpression of DEF2 negatively interferes with pollen viability and seed production <ref type="bibr">(Stotz et al., 2009a,b)</ref>.</p><p>Fertilization in flowering plants involves distinct pollenepistil interactions that include determinants of selfincompatibility, factors for pollen germination and tube growth, pollen tube attractants and bursting <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Amien et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Higashiyama, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Okuda et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Schopfer et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Takayama et al., 2001)</ref>. The Zea mays defensin ZmES4 plays a central role in inter-gametophyte signalling. It mediates pollen tube bursting by activating the K þ channel KZM1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Amien et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Antifungal plant defensins are also involved in the defence against parasitic plants and insects. The sunflower defensin Ha-DEF1 specifically combats invasion of the parasitic plant Orobanche cumana. When Ha-DEF1 is exogenously applied to the parasitic plant embryo, it causes browning symptoms at the radicle apex of Orobanche seedlings during the germination step, but has necrotic effects neither on other parasitic plants, e.g. Striga hermonthica, nor on the host plant Arabidopsis thaliana <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(de Zelicourt et al., 2007)</ref>.

All these proteins exclusively exhibit antifungal activity against filamentous ascomycetes at micromolar concentrations, including opportunistic plantand animal pathogens, such as Fusarium sp., Botrytis sp., and A. fumigatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Marx, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Meyer, 2008)</ref>. Moreover, the P. chrysogenum PAF inhibits the growth of selected Zygomycete species <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Galgoczy et al., 2005)</ref>. Further exceptions are (i) the A. clavatus AcAMP with antibacterial activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hajji et al., 2010)</ref> and (ii) the A. niger AnAFP with anti-yeast activity (Gun <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lee et al., 1999)</ref>. <ref type="formula">iii</ref>The recently characterized P. brevicompactum BP only weakly affects yeast growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Seibold et al., 2011)</ref>. To date, PAF is one of the best characterized antifungal proteins of fungal origin besides its orthologous AFP from A. giganteus <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Marx, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Meyer, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Marx et al., 2008)</ref>, and both exhibit functional similarities with plant defensins to a certain extent. Although direct evidence is lacking, it is believed that the toxicity of many of these fungal AMPs is based on their interaction with molecules/receptors situated in the cell wall and/ or the plasma membrane of target fungi from where signalling cascades are activated. In the case of PAF, heterotrimeric Gprotein and cAMP/protein kinase A signalling are involved, whereas AFP activates the cell wall integrity pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Leiter et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Binder et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Binder et al., , 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hegedus et al., 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hagen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Ouedraogo et al., 2011)</ref>. The interaction of PAF with the sensitive Aspergillus nidulans leads to an immediate hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane at hyphal tips accompanied by K þ efflux and Ca 2þ influx <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Leiter et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Binder et al., 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kaiserer et al., 2003)</ref> which parallels the effect observed with plant defensins RsAFP2 and DmAMP1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Thevissen et al., 1996)</ref>. Changes in the membrane potential might influence the activity of ion channels/pumps/transporters or be a result of their activation. We could prove that the P. chrysogenum PAF and the A. giganteus AFP NN5353 trigger a rapid Ca 2þ influx which leads to a sustained elevation of the cytoplasmic Ca 2þ resting level in the sensitive fungi N. crassa and A. niger, respectively. This Ca 2þ influx, however, does not result from unspecific pore formation in the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Binder et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Binder et al., , 2010b</ref>. It is well known that a sustained perturbation of Ca 2þ homeostasis may trigger PCD. Intracellular ROS and apoptotic markers are indeed increased in PAF-treated sensitive fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Leiter et al., 2005)</ref>. Interestingly, supplementation of the growth medium with Ca 2þ ions, decreases the toxicity of antifungal proteins and counteracts the perturbation of the intracellular Ca 2þ resting level. This points towards the induction of adaptive responses that may be induced by ion/Ca 2þ signalling <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Binder et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Binder et al., , 2010b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Ouedraogo et al., 2011)</ref>. Even though PAF and AFP exhibit close similarities in their structure, function and antimicrobial spectrum, they also show significant differences in their mechanisms of action. AFP modulates the cell wall composition of sensitive fungi by enhancing a-1,3-glucan synthase A (agsA) and the chitin synthase D (chsD) gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hagen et al., 2007)</ref> which suggests an attempt by the fungus to counteract AFP attack. As evidenced by the close AFP relative AFP NN5353 , agsA induction is mediated via protein kinase C (Pkc)/MAPK A. Instead, PAF fails to trigger the cell wall integrity pathway (CWIP) and PkcA/MAPK A signalling is not activated <ref type="figure">(Binder et al., 2010a)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> e Summary of the current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of antifungal action and additional biological functions of selected antifungal defensins and defensin-like AMPs from fungi, plants, insects and mammals.

A similar uptake mechanism and staining pattern in sensitive fungi was shown for the AFP relative AFP NN5353 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Binder et al., 2011)</ref>. Most interestingly, there is increasing evidence that antifungal proteins, similar to defensins from plants, insects and mammals, exhibit additional functions that go beyond antimicrobial activity. The P. chrysogenum paf and the A. giganteus afp exhibit a temporal and spatial regulation during asexual differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Hegedus et al., 2011a;</ref>. Both genes are exclusively expressed in the vegetative mycelium at the developmental stage.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>As summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>, antifungal defensins and defensinlike AMPs exhibit complex biological functions in addition to antimicrobial toxicity. The multitude of biological functions undoubtedly underscores the great impact of these proteins on our life. They gain great medical and biotechnological significance as attractive candidates for drug development and combinatorial therapies. In addition, they allow crop improvement by the generation of transgenic plants with enhanced resistance against phytopathogenic fungi, insects and plant parasites <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Terras et al., 1995)</ref>. Notably, the recent discovery that antifungal AMPs of fungal origin also cover sensing/signalling functions contributes to our knowledge on the regulation of fungal development and may be of extraordinary importance for the optimization of fermentation processes and for the production of secondary metabolites and other fungal products. It is, however, most puzzling how one protein may display such functional diversity. One explanation could be its specific protein structure. The disulfide bonds between the cysteine residues not only stabilize a compact structure, but they may be sensitive to specific environmental or cellular redox conditions. These may influence the redox status of the protein itself and finally determine its conformation and binding affinity with target molecules and even promote protein dimerization or oligomerization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Batta et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Wu et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hoover et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Hoover et al., , 2001</ref>.

However, increasing knowledge about the structureefunction relation of defensins and defensin-like AMPs opens new opportunities to improve their function and their (selective) antimicrobial activity, or to introduce new activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Francois et al., 2005)</ref>, for example, by the substitution of single amino acids or by the de novo synthesis of non-natural peptides.

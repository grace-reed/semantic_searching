				<p>Halimeda organism, which is constructed out of a mass of these filaments, may therefore be considered one giant multinucleate cell. This filament without cross walls, or coenocytic filament, occurs also in a few other algae such as Penicillus, Tydemania, Udotea and Caulerpa, all of them green algae or members of the Chlorophyta, and in the Phycomycete fungi. These green algae, with their siphon-like filaments.</p>

The Sea Garland.</p><p>This dainty plant groweth up from some Rockes or stones, in or neere the Sea, spreading sundry flat, thicke, short and round leaves, one set on the toppe of another, and some also growing from the sides, forming branches of leaves leaning downewards, each being as it were strung on a thred which yet is scarce to be discerned, like as a Country Garland of field and corne flowers, are used to be made to decke the Country houses, and their places of sport, so that the whole plant seemeth to be made of nothing but strung leaves, bearing a large yellow flower at the toppe saith Bauhinus, but I much doubt he taketh that supposition from the Ficus Indica Americana, the lower leaves are somewhat browne, the rest are whitish greene, and those that are new sprung are greene, and all of them smooth and shining, even kept betweene papers for a long time, and of a saltish taste, yet by long time growing rougher and full of wrinckles, but still tough and not brittle like Corall or Coralline, and growing soft againe steeped in water, yet still very salt.</p><p>Parkinson <ref type="bibr">(1640)</ref> Over 300 years ago Parkinson provided this first English description of a Halimeda, calling it Opuntia marina, the sea garland. With prose and drawing ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1)</ref>, he so clearly captured the essence of the only species then known, H. tuna of the Mediterranean, that his words seem an appropriate introduction to this entire genus of green, calcareous marine algae.</p><p>ECOLOGY AND TAXONOMY OF Halimeda The discovery of other species, in the intervening years, has shown that the genus is not always dainty and the descriptive terminology has grown accordingly. Nevertheless, the overall appearance of the genus is characteristic, and whether one first encounters it while swimming in a coral reef, or examining an array of dried herbarium specimens, it can be identified almost at once, for it looks like some form of underwater cactus, with photosynthetic portions consisting of series of calcified segments or joints, the strung leaves of Parkinson, which may be arranged in some branching pattern. The plant body, or thallus, also possesses a holdfast which provides attachment to or in the substrate <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2</ref>).</p><p>All species of Halimeda deposit calcium carbonate in the form of aragonite. Hence, the green colour of the segments, which are the photosynthetic portions of the thallus, is muted. Calcification begins when the segment is about 36 hours old <ref type="bibr">(Wilbur et ah, 1969)</ref> ; therefore, even those small young thalli that appear flatulent and green are calcified. The only uncalcified portions are nodes (to be described below), apical segments 3'ounger than about 36 hours old, and rhizoidal filaments.</p><p>-^ .Holdfast of a ""TapSas*--Holdfast of branched few loose filaments; &gt;^-^^^^;-^^^f ilaments which form usually several on a mat which fixes onto a plant  <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Basic parts of a Halimeda, and the three main types of holdfast. ThalU which sprawl over rock or sand usually have a number of places of attachment, provided by a few loose filaments from between segments or sometimes from the ends of segments. In rock-growers generally the branched filaments form a mat which holds to rock, whereas in sand-growing species the branched holdfast filaments adhere to fine particles of substrate, and the whole forms a sizeable "root".

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The basic plan</head><p>The constructional unit of the entire alga, both holdfast and segment, is the filament <ref type="bibr">(Fig.</ref> 3), which has a diameter of approximately 0-05-0-1 mm. These filaments, with a resemblance to fungal hyphae, are matted and branched in such a way as to build plants which range in size from 5 cm or less in H. lacrimosa, to over 1 m in sprawling forms of H. opuntia.</p><p>The filament itself is unusual. Unlike those of most other plants it lacks cross walls which would divide it into a linear row of cells. The <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. The constructional unit of Halimeda is the coenocytic filament. In segments, in contrast to holdfasts, there is a definite pattern of organization which is least complex in H. cryptica, a species with a single main filament. This central medullary filament branches several times, producing lateral branches which also branch.</p><p>In most species there are several to many medullary filaments. Scale bar is 1 mm. Material is stained with dilute Lugol's solution, and mounted in glycerine.</p><p>(From <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Colinvaux and Graham, 1964.)</ref> b L. HILLIS-COLINVAUX were formerly classified in the order Siphonales. Hence they often are described as siphonaceous.</p><p>Cross walls in the filaments have not been observed to form regularly at any stage in the life-history of Halimeda. In this way, and in its regular multinucleate condition, this genus differs from Acetabularia, another well-known calcareous green alga.</p><p>.|ini|inf|?ifijfiir|i!iiitur| 12 3 <ref type="bibr">Fig. 4</ref>. H. cylindracea, from the lagoon of Enewetak Atoll. The specimen has been decalcified to show the extensiveness of the mass of holdfast filaments which are normally obscured by adhering particles of substrate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Holdfast</head><p>The filaments of the holdfast are not organized into a regular shape such as a segment. They generally branch irregularly to form a mass of threads, which may remain loose, as in much of the opuntia material, may become tangled into a mat as in H. tuna, or may adhere to fine particles of loose substrate and with these particles produce an impressive bulbous structure to 13 cm or more in length <ref type="bibr">(Figs 2,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5)</ref>. These large holdfasts sometimes grow in a reducing environment.</p><p>In at least some species the main rhizoidal filaments have muchthickened walls, whereas the walls of the finer branches are not noticeably thickened.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Segment</head><p>In contrast to the holdfasts, the filaments within segments show a definite pattern of organization. In most species several central, socalled medullary or axial, filaments run the length of the segment <ref type="bibr">(Figs 3,</ref><ref type="bibr">6)</ref> and the entire length of the branch, "stringing" the segments together. These filaments form the central axis, core or medulla. The exception, cryptica, has a core of but a single filament <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Colinvaux and Graham, 1964)</ref>, which is two or more times the diameter of such filaments in other species (personal observation).</p><p>The medullary filaments generally branch trichotomously, with the resultant branches becoming displaced laterally and rebranching one to three times. This lateral branch system is the cortex <ref type="figure">(Figs 3, 6</ref>).</p><p>The branches themselves, called utricles, are relatively short, and become progressively shorter towards the periphery of the segment.</p><p>They also may be swollen, except at their bases, where in most species they are usually constricted and the wall thickened. The outermost or peripheral branches are called primary nitrides, the ones immediately to the inside are secondary utricles, and so on until cortex disappears into medulla <ref type="bibr">(Figs 6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7)</ref>.</p><p>The primary utricles of most species touch at their peripheral edges and adhere in mature segments. In surface view, therefore, the peripheral utricles generally appear polygonal, like a section of honeycomb ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 8)</ref>. They give the impression of cells and in the older literature sometimes, erroneously, were called cells, although they are but the adhering tips of coenocytic filaments.</p><p>The cortex of the segment is not uniformly developed over the entire plant but varies with the relative age of the segment, and is -^-M \)m \^i:7/"r <ref type="bibr">'''7// ,</ref> where calcification begins -NODE where next segment will grow <ref type="bibr">Fig. 6</ref>. Longitudinal sections through part of a segment <ref type="bibr">(incrassata)</ref> showing its basic filamentous construction. Note absence of cross walls throughout, which makes this plant a coenoeyte. In the right-hand diagram the medullary filaments at the ajDex of the segment (right) have started to grow and branch to form a new segment.</p><p>Such filaments show a distinct gradient in kinds and quantities of organelles.

They were plastids with very large starch grains which he called amyloplasts <ref type="bibr">(Figs 55,</ref><ref type="bibr">59)</ref>, and those with no starch grains, the chloroplasts <ref type="bibr">(Figs 10,</ref><ref type="bibr">59)</ref>. He called this two-plastid system heteroplasty . The plastic condition, however, is not so clear cut since starch is also present in chloroplasts <ref type="bibr">(Section III;</ref><ref type="bibr">Figs 10,</ref><ref type="bibr">59</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">Wilbur et al, 1969</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Colombo and Orsenigo, 1977)</ref>.</p><p>Amyloplasts are the only plastids in the rhizoidal filaments (personal observation), whereas chloroplasts predominate within photosynthesizing mature, but not aged, segments, at least in the daytime <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">(Wilbur et al, 1969</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Borowitzka and Larkum, 1974b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Colombo and Orsenigo, 1977)</ref>. In the non-peripheral utricles of the segment both kinds of plastids may occur (personal observation). The pigments contained by the chloroplasts are chlorophylls a and 6, in a ratio usually of about 2 : 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Jeffrey, 1968</ref>), together with the principal carotenoids known for other green algae, as well as two additional carotenoids siphonoxanthin and siphonein <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Kleinig, 1969)</ref>.</p><p>The chloroplasts of Halimeda are bounded by a double membrane, although the outer one is not always intact.

The membranes, before they break with age, may be as resistant to breaking as are those of the related, but non-calcified Caulerpa, which <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Giles and Sarafis (1974)</ref> were unable to rupture by <ref type="bibr">blending, grinding, freezing,</ref> thawing, sonication or a variety of chemical treatments. Such rigescent membranes may explain the resistance of siphonaceous chloroplasts to digestion by opisthobranchiate mollusc grazers, and the survival of the chloroplasts within the animals for a month or more.</p><p>Thylakoids, or photosynthetic lamellae, are present in chloroplasts, and in amyloplasts in which the starch grain does not completely fill the boundary membrane <ref type="bibr">(Borowitzka and Larkum, 1974b;</ref><ref type="bibr">personal observation)</ref>. They traverse the length of the plastid, and in so doing may encircle a central starch grain if present. The lamellae appear to be constructed of linearly arranged vesicles <ref type="bibr">(Borowitzka and Larkum, 1974b)</ref> and are appressed into groups <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 10)</ref>. In chloroplasts, their number, within limits, increases with age, whereas in amyloplasts the starch grain may become so large that the development of thylakoids is restricted, and the lamellae are displaced outwards until the plastid membrane eventually ruptures.</p><p>Synthesis and organization of the thylakoids involve a system of concentric lamellae at one end of the plastid ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>), variously called "concentric lamellae" <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Descomps, 1965)</ref>, "concentric lamellar system" <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Hori and Ueda, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Hori, 1974)</ref>, "thylakoid organizing body" or "TOB" <ref type="bibr">(Borowitzka and Larkum, 1974a, b)</ref>, and "dome-shaped body" (Turner and <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">Friedmann, 1974)</ref>.

No aragonite crystals were found associated with them, but fine fibrils somewhat similar in appearance to those associated with the walls of the filaments in segments (as described above) were observed along the peripheral edge of the electron-dense outer wall layer of young filaments. E. Summary: facets of the unusual structure and chemistry of Halimeda</p><p>Halimeda is one of the largest and most complex of the green algae. It is a filamentous alga which has been elaborated from a simple plan of rows of tube-like filaments and is without cells.</p><p>The resultant plant, which may sometimes reach 0-25 m in height if erect, or sprawl to over 1 m in length, is composed of a photosynthetic portion of many segments, the "strung leaves" of Parkinson, and a holdfast system which ranges from a few short loose filaments to a truly massive production which may extend to 13 cm or more. The holdfast may exist in an anoxic environment. Such a plant is derived by the extensive growth, with limited and controlled branching, of one or a few closely associated filaments. Aided by their wall chemistry, the branch tips of the filaments, with growth completed, stick together forming a closed or nearly closed internal environment in which the precipitation of aragonitic calcium carbonate occurs.</p><p>The algal walls are made without cellulose and the component filaments lack cross walls. The resultant "siphon", which contains the nuclei equivalent to many cells but not the compartments, is a coenocjrtic filament.</p><p>Much of the filamentous system contains a large central vacuole pushing against a thin cytoplasmic layer which is pressed to the filament wall. Many of the usual microcomponents are present within the filament : nuclei, plastids, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes, Golgi bodies, mitochondria, microtubules and lipid globules. Some plastids, the amyloplasts, contain mostly starch.</p><p>Chloroplasts, with their well-developed system of photosynthetic lamellae, may contain some starch as well or this may be absent. No pyrenoids have been observed. The pigments present in the chloroplasts are chlorophylls a and b, in a ratio usually of about 2:1, and the principal carotenoids known for the other green algae. Two other carotenoids, siphonoxanthin and siphonein, are also present.</p><p>The chloroplasts, which are discoidal, are relatively small compared</p><p>to those of many green algae, and the nuclei are also small. Little is known about the chromosomes, DNA or RNA of this alga, although DNA has been reported to be present in chloroplasts and mitochondria.</p><p>Other microcomponents of the filament include two characteristic unknown bodies, one that is electron dense, the other which is spherical and reticular.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. A Brief History of Halimeda Studies</head><p>The first taxonomic description of a Halimeda appeared in 1599, in a book of Mediterranean natural history by the naturalist Imperato <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 11</ref>). Using the name Sertolara he both drew and wrote about a Mediterranean sea plant, which in subsequent binomial nomenclature eventually was called Halimeda tuna. This Halimeda species remained the only member of this taxon for more than a century, even though there was considerable botanical activity at the time. Its loneness, however, is not surprising, for it is the only recognized Halimeda species of this essentially tropical genus that grows in the Mediterranean.</p><p>Authentic additions to the Halimeda species list had to await the work of naturalists and collectors in areas remote from European centres of learning.</p><p>All references to Halimedae in the seventeenth century, therefore, are to this one species, H. tuna, but it is heard of with many different names. Clusius (1601) called it Lichen marinus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">Parkinson (1640)</ref> named it Opuntia marina. And in their catalogue of 1651 <ref type="bibr">Bauhin and Cherler</ref> listed both these names, as well as introducing two more, Fucus folio rotunda and Scutellaria sive Opuntia marina. But all are the same plant. I 7^B ELL'HIST. NATVRALE Sertolara.</p></div>

The earliest non-Mediterranean collections of Halimeda came from the West Indies, notably those obtained in about 1687 by the physician Hans Sloane, later Sir Hans Sloane, who stopped at Jamaica in the suite of the Duke of Albemarle. Sloane's visit was curtailed by the death of the Duke, but nonetheless he collected some 800 new plant and animal species during the 15 months of his stay <ref type="bibr">(Sloane, 1707)</ref>. Among these was the second species of Halimeda to be discovered. In his volume dealing with the natural history of Jamaica, Sloane (1707) called this species Corallina opuntia. It is what is now known as Halimeda opuntia, the straggly cushion-shaped clusters of which are a prominent feature of shallow parts of Caribbean reefs. Sloane's specimen is contained in the Sloane Herbarium of the British Museum (Natural History).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Ellis: microscopy and the plant or animal question</head><p>The most significant contributor to early Halimeda history, however, was John Ellis, one of the outstanding naturalists of Great Britain of the last half of the eighteenth century. Indulging his interest in plants and animals of land and sea, he developed a network of correspondents in various parts of the world, especially America and the West Indies, receiving from them numerous materials for study. His eventual appointments as King's Agent for the province of West Florida (1764) and the Island of Dominica (1770) provided him with sufficient income to follow his inclinations more freely <ref type="bibr" target="#b270">(Smith, 1819</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">Savage, 1948)</ref>.</p><p>Of especial interest to Ellis were the "Corallines", a group of calcareous and horny sea organisms which he successfully established as an animal group in his classic "Essay Towards a Natural History of the Corallines" of 1755, although Peyssonnel had somewhat earlier recognized an animal nature in at least some of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">(Savage, 1948)</ref>. This coralline group was diverse, and although the principal representatives were various cnidarians, the complex also included calcareous sea organisms such as the green alga Halimeda and the red alga Corallina.</p><p>Because of this, two Halimeda species, subsequently known as incrassata and opuntia, were included in the 1755 publication as "Articulated Corallines of Jamaica". Eventually Ellis separated five species of Halimeda: incrassata, tridens, monile, opuntia and tuna, but the genus had not been established as yet, and they were assigned to Corallina. As such they appear in his treatise with Solander <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Ellis and Solander, 1786)</ref>, published after the death of both Ellis and Solander under the direction of Ellis' daughter, Martha Watts. The use of binomial nomenclature in this work and in an earlier publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Ellis, 1767)</ref> probably grew out of his extensive correspondence with Linnaeus and work with Solander, a favourite student of <ref type="bibr">Linnaeus.</ref> Four of the species with their epithets are still accepted; the remaining one, tridens, has been placed in synonymy under incrassata <ref type="bibr">(Section IV)</ref>. The species incrassata (tridens) and monile were new with Elhs, whereas opuntia had been described by Linnaeus in his "Systema Naturae" (1758), using the binomial Corallina opuntia. Others before this had assigned other names to it, generally polynomials.</p><p>Ellis' examination of Halimeda material included microscopical study of both surface and internal features <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 12)</ref>  </p></div>

More intensive microscopic examination was not undertaken until over a century later, first by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Askenasy (1888)</ref> and then by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Barton (1901)</ref>. Ellis particularly noticed the pits and facets given to the surface of Halimeda segments by the peripheral utricles, and compared them with the surface patterns of cnidarian corals :</p><p>We see in the greatest number of Corallines their surface full of holes ; we saw the same in Escharas and Milleporas thirty years ago; since that time magnifying glasses have been improved, so as to shew us, that they are all orifices, for polype-like suckers; why should not we now admit that glasses may be still more improved, so as even to make us able to see what may be the intention and use of these minute orifices, which according to all rules of reasoning, we must suppose to approach in nature to them they are most alike.</p><p>This provided part of the basis for considering Halimeda as an animal. Ellis' conclusions had force because of his skill and reputation as a microscopist. Linnaeus wrote to him, "I beg of you to lend me your lynx-like eyes" (Library of the Linnean kSociety of London; <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">Savage, 1948)</ref>. Furthermore, ElHs worked with some of the best laboratory hardware of the day including an "aquatic microscope" <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 13)</ref> made by a London optician and "improved" by Ellis specifically for examining living corallines. I used Ellis' aquatic microscope at the Science Museum (London) and found the resolution to be surprisingly good. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> shows a photomicrograph of the surface of Halimeda incrassata made with it. The more obvious surface features of the plant can be conceived almost as certainly as with a modern microscope. The smallness of the field, and its curv^ature, are the main problems of these simple instruments. Chromatic aberration led to some vexing difficulties, but not as much as in the compound microscopes of the time.</p><p>Ellis provided additional contemporary insights on microscopes and viewing in a letter to Dr David Skene in 1770 (Library of the Linnean Society of London; <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">Savage, 1948)</ref>.</p><p>I find Wilsons or the Single microscope much the best ; there need not be any piano convex glass screwd in at bottom if you have a good illuminating concave speculum to throw up the light, and at the same time to take instead of the piano convex on the bottom to screw on the bottom a brass circular plate with a hole in the centre in proportion to the size of your magnifier; the largest magnifier as No. 1 requires the smallest hole, by this means in a clear day youll easily see the minutest animal distinctly. Mr. Dollond has at my request fitted up a pocket microscope that pleases most people ; it consists of my aquatic &amp; Wilsons combind together so as to be very little larger than the aquatic alone The Museum description states: "This type of microscope may be regarded as the precursor of the most complete and perfect of our simple dissection microscopes, and it was made with slight modifications by all the leading opticians until the early years of the 19th century. . . . The round hollow pillar screws into a socket in the lid of the fish-skin case. The mirror mounted in gimbals is fitted to the pillar by a spring-pin and socket. The inner sliding rod which carries the objective arm can be fixed at the desired height by a clamping screw. The stage is removable for portability, and a Wilson screw barrel microscope with three additional powers is added, which can be adapted to the stand". (Photograph British Crown Copyright.

Most of the numerous faint dots or small circles in the utricles are chloroplasts ; the darker spots and curves are associated with subsurface structure. Both may have encouraged Ellis to think of polyps (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref>). The average diameter of the surface utricles is   in the Double or Compound microscope. This does very well for the larger objects and is pleasing to many on acct of the largness of the Field.</p><p>Ellis' consideration of corallines as animals was further strengthened by his deductions about their chemistry such as he demonstrated to the Society of Arts, Commerce and others. He showed that corallines, when burned, produced not the "smell of burnt vegetables", but "an offensive smell like that of burnt bones, or hair". Indeed, the door of the room where the Society was meeting "was obliged to be opened, to dissipate the disagreeable scent, and let in fresh air" <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Ellis, 1767)</ref>.</p><p>Such arguments for the animal nature of Halimeda were part of the fascinating and well-reasoned letter Ellis wrote to Linnaeus in 1767.</p><p>This letter, a portion of which is also a paper in the Philosophical Transactions, was one of two of Ellis' works chosen for citation in the presentation speech for the Royal Society's Copley Medal award to Ellis the following year <ref type="bibr" target="#b270">(Smith, 1819)</ref>.</p><p>Linnaeus accepted much of Ellis' position on the animal nature of corallines, and in his own last edition of "Systema Naturae" <ref type="bibr">(1766)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1767)</ref> wrote of calcareousness indicating animal origin : "Corallinas ad regnum animale pertinere ex substantia earum calcarea constat, cum omnem calcem animalium esse productum verissimum sit." That Linnaeus had reservations, however, is shown by his keeping the corallines in his rather ambiguous group "Zoophyta", which he defined as compound animals bearing flowers, their vegetating stem passing by metamorphoses into a flowering animal. Included under Zoophyta in the tenth edition <ref type="bibr">(1758)</ref>, as well as in the last (1767), was Halimeda opuntia{a,s Corallina opuntia), the only^aZimec^a species Linnaeus apparently knew.</p><p>Other contemporary workers such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Baxter (1761)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">Pallas (1766)</ref> objected to this animal classification of the genus Corallina since the actual polyps had not been observed, but <ref type="bibr">Ellis' arguments were</ref> sufficiently convincing that for the remainder of the century the genus generally was placed among the animals. The practice was continued into the nineteenth century with the work of naturalists such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Lamarck (1813)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">and Lamouroux (1812</ref><ref type="bibr">and Lamouroux ( , 1816</ref>, but the term "zoophyte" was replaced with the preferred "polypier". More significantly, Lamouroux subdivided the coralline group into a number of genera. One of these was Halimedea (1812) or Halimeda (1816), to which he transferred the five species delimited by <ref type="bibr">Ellis.</ref> The generic name we now use had been born. Another name, Sertolaria, with Imperato's Sertolara as type specimen, actually had been proposed earlier by Boehmer (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Ludwig, 1760)</ref>, but the epithet Halimeda is the one that became established and in 1956 this familiar name was conserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">(Lanjouw et al., 1956</ref>). That these organisms really were plants, however, still had to be worked out.</p><p>The first person in the nineteenth century recorded as definitely placing Halimeda in the plant kingdom, but under the name HormisMS, appears to have been Targioni-Tozzetti, whose unpublished manuscript was cited by Bertolini (1819). Link (1834), Chauvin (1842) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Decaisne (1842)</ref> also placed this genus in the plant kingdom, and by 1842 it was generally accepted that Halimeda was a plant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Halimeda discoveries: the beginnings of critical taxonomy</head><p>Voyages of exploration as well as travels of individuals interested in living organisms in the eighteenth century yielded additional new species which were described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Decaisne (1841</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Decaisne ( , 1842</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">Krauss (1846)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b315">Zanardini (1851</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b316">Zanardini ( , 1858</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Kiitzing (1857</ref><ref type="bibr">Kiitzing ( -1858</ref>, Piccone (1879), Hauck (1886), <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Agardh (1887)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Askenasy (1888)</ref>, changing the species total from 5 to 27 in about 50 years. Not all of these species proved satisfactory, however. Until 1888, the taxonomy was based almost entirely on external characteristics, with emphasis on what is now recognized as an exceedingly variable character, "segment shape". The microscope was not used critically for identification and Kiitzing 's statement (1857), that internal organization was uniform among the species of Halimeda, provides some insight into the "state of the science" at that time. With such heavy reliance on segment shape, it is not surprising that certain taxa such as opuntia, and to a lesser extent incrassata, both of which commonly show a large variety of segment types, were at one time each described as more than one species. Segment shape, along with habit, also formed the basis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Agardh's (1887)</ref> sections within the genus which subsequently have been ignored <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>, at least partly because of their unsatisfactory definition.</p><p>The cornerstone of critical modern taxonomy and microscopy for the genus was laid by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Askenasy (1888)</ref> who used microscopic characters to distinguish the few Halimeda species collected during an expedition of the S.M.S. Gazelle, as well as to delimit the new species macrophysa.</p><p>Of special significance was the fusion he described of medullary filaments at the node in the species incrassata (Table III, Type 1). A brief reference to altered medullary filaments at the node, made by Agardh (1887) and by Ellis as early as 1755, provided some microscopic observations, but Askenasy's work represents the first detailed account of a major microscopic characteristic.</p><p>Askenasy not only emphasized nodal patterns of medullary filaments but also discovered that the sizes and shapes of peripheral utricles ("Rindenschlauche") differed significantly among taxa. He also provided a very clear description of the calcium carbonate deposits within Halimeda, pointing out that the crystals develop in the spaces outside the filaments, but within the confines of the segment, that is, that calcification is not external to the segment. The perceptive account shows his skills as an able contemporary microscopist and investigator. Little was added to this description until the 1960s <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Lewin, 1962)</ref>, when the tools of electron microscopy and radioisotopes became available.</p><p>C. The discovery at Funafuti: the reef-building capabilities of Halimeda</p><p>At the close of the nineteenth century the Royal Society and the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Government of New South Wales sponsored an expedition to Funafuti</head><p>Atoll ill the Ellice Islands of the south Pacific for the purpose of boring a deep hole to test Darwin's hypothesis on the origin of atolls. The first hole had to be abandoned after about 25 m of drilling, but two long cores were successfully taken, the deepest penetrating to 339 m.</p><p>For the history of Halimeda this expedition and its results were especially significant for three reasons. An analysis of the cores showed not only that Halimeda segments were prominent, and hence that this alga participated in reef building, but also that in these particular cores this calcareous green alga, by the volume of sediment contributed, appeared to be more important than corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Finckh, 1904)</ref>. This activity will be discussed in Section IX.</p><p>A collection of intact specimens of Halimeda from various sites in the atoll was ako m.ade during the expedition, and was given to Miss Ethel Sarel <ref type="bibr">Barton, later Mrs Gepp, of the British Museum (Natural History)</ref> to identify. This led to a paper on the Halimeda of Funafuti <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Barton, 1900)</ref>, but of much greater significance was her realization of the vast inconsistencies in the existing taxonomy of the genus and the need for its serious revision. Askenasy's skilful work pointed the way, and the opportunity soon arose. In 1900, Madame Weber-van Bosse asked Barton to work on the large collection of Halimeda made during the Siboga expedition led by her husband to the Dutch Indies in 1899 and 1900. Barton began an intensive study of the genus as then available to her, which led to the important monograph of 1901.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The taxonomy of Barton</head><p>Barton's investigation was a careful one. She dissected specimens and measured various characters. But, most importantly, she saw and examined as much of the type material of the species then recognized as she could obtain. Consequently, she was able to compare specimens with authority. She examined a number of characteristics in the many plants available, mostly East Indian, and concluded that the pattern of medullary filament fusion at the node was the most consistent character and the only one of significant taxonomic value.</p><p>Barton established three patterns of nodal medullary filaments <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table III, Types 1, 2</ref>, 3, respectively) as follows:</p><p>all medullary filaments come together into a single unit, often with conspicuous pits or pores between adjacent filaments, and then separate ; the filaments fuse, in pairs, for a short distance and then separate ; filaments fuse completely in groups of twos or threes and do not separate thereafter, although the filaments eventually branch in the segment above that particular node.</p><p>The first type was originally described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Askenasy (1888)</ref> and is represented by the species incrassata. The second type, represented by opuntia, and the third by tuna and gracilis were first delimited by <ref type="bibr">Barton.</ref> The usefulness of Barton's monograph at that particular time was strengthened further by her rigid application of this nodal character. Her taxonomy was supplemented with one other microscopical character, the extent of adhesion of the peripheral utricles and by judicial use of segment shape. As a result, specimens with similar nodal anatomy, such as incrassata and tridens, were assigned the same epithet instead of different ones which had happened when the taxonomy was based on segment morphology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Ellis and Solander (1786)</ref>, and subsequently others, including Agardh (1 887), had considered them distinct species on the basis of the predominant segment shape being plano-convex in incrassata and tridentate in tridens.</p><p>A prime result of Barton's treatment was the retention of but 7 species of Halimeda <ref type="table">(Table I)</ref> out of the more than 25 that had been recognized hitherto. A second result was that order within the genus was established.</p><p>A few specimens, however, were obviously troublesome to <ref type="bibr">Barton,</ref> for they did not fit her scheme. Of these, a few are best interpreted as being poorly developed individuals. A very few were aberrant in that the medullary filaments did not fuse at the node in any of the designated ways, but remained entirely separate. Barton did not interpret this pattern as representing a separate category of nodal filament structure, however, because she felt she had plants with "all gradations of the character from filaments with well-developed pits to those which were entirely free and shewed even no trace of thin places on their unusually thick walls". Consequently those that she did not consider to be stunted or small specimens of the typical incrassata, she designated as a distinct form of incrassata, f. ovata. The form epithet was chosen because these plants resembled, at least externally, Agardh's incrassata v. ovata, the type of which she was unable to examine microscopically.</p><p>Although Barton was apparently satisfied with this decision, and her conservatism was reasonable considering the small number of such specimens available to her, the true nature of the material is more interesting. I have examined all Barton's material at the British Museum (Natural History) as well as the Siboga collection in the tl3 111 :::!.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>to</head><p>Rijksherbarium of Leiden, the herbaria where most, if not all, of the f. ovata material is deposited.</p><p>The f. ovata specimens are relatively few, occasionally poorly developed, and sometimes too scant to be adequately examined. However, most of those on which it has been feasible to work are micronesica, a species described in 1941 which will be discussed later on p. 32, and which is of especial interest because of the pattern of its nodal medullary filaments. A few are opuntia or simulans, the latter a taxon in which the pores of the fused nodal filaments are sometimes small and not readily noticeable <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>. It, therefore, presents some of the gradations Barton indicated for this character in the above quotation. These identifications of the anomalous f. ovata material have clarified and to a certain extent strengthened the major portions of <ref type="bibr">Barton's work.</ref> In retrospect. Barton's taxonomy was conservative, which was an approach much needed at the time. Its strengths lay in the discovery of essentially one microscopic characteristic of major taxonomic significance, in the fairly rigid application of it in identification, in the emphasis on examination of type specimens, and in the inclusion of material from other than the Siboga collection, which, although severely limited, did extend the work to all the tropical oceans. After the monograph was published. Barton continued identifying algae, published one paper on reproductive structures in Halimeda <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Gepp, 1904)</ref>, and more on Siboga algae in the important joint publication, with her husband, about the Codiaceae <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Gepp and Gepp, 1911)</ref>. The work after 1911 was not extensive, however; there appeared to be little further study of Halimeda, and one suspects that marriage in 1904 to Anthony Gepp, Curator of Botany at the British Museum (Natural History), and the contemporary attitude towards women and careers had their impact. For a brief time, however, the genus Halimeda was tidy.</p><p>E. Howe, Borgesen, Taylor and Hillis: the modern taxonomy No taxonomic scheme of living organisms is fixed, however, and in a very short time after the publication of Barton's monograph many new collections became available to test the workability and validity of her system. Initially specimens came mostly from the Caribbean, a tropical region scantily represented in Barton's work, and for the first time the material was studied by workers who had some responsibility for collecting it. They were Marshall A. Howe of the New York Botanical Garden and Frederick Borgesen of the Botanical Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark, who worked in the Danish West Indies and pubHshed extensively on the algae of the Canary Islands and Mauritius. Both adopted <ref type="bibr">Barton'</ref> <ref type="table">s fused filament characteristic for separating species,</ref> and Howe added other characters which subsequently proved as useful.</p><p>While examining a certain abundant and distinctive West Indian plant, he noticed, for example, that its secondary utricles were more than twice as broad as those of most other specimens <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 20,</ref><ref type="bibr">No. 11)</ref>. Furthermore, the character was consistent. It could be used, therefore, to distinguish species, and Howe reasoned that specimens with this character should have separate status and not be considered synonymous with H. tuna as <ref type="bibr">Barton had done. Howe (1907)</ref>, therefore, reestablished the species discoidea, which brought the total of accepted Halimeda species to eight. Among the microscopic characteristics investigated by <ref type="bibr">Barton were</ref> those of appearance and size of the peripheral utricles in surface view. She did not find them particularly helpful, however, which in retrospect is reasonable because her species concept was exceedingly broad.</p><p>Howe observed, though, that average diameters of the peripheral utricles in surface view could be used to separate entities with the same basic type of filament fusion at the nodes. Using the characters of average diameter of peripheral utricles (surface view) and predominant shape of segments <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table II)</ref>, he re-established the species monile, which had been placed in synonymy under incrassata by <ref type="bibr">Barton,</ref> and recognized a new species, simulans, which possessed the same type of nodal character as the other two species <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Howe, 1907)</ref>.</p><p>This use of additional microscopic characters represents an important refinement of taxonomic criteria for the genus and an early application of field experience with this taxon, which Barton and most of the preceding workers on Halimeda did not have. Howe appears to have been provoked into looking for reliable differences in microscopic structure because he had observed incrassata (his tridens), and monile growing in close proximity in Bermuda, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, yet remaining distinct. Where simulans was observed growing near incrassata he also reported no intergrading forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Howe, 1907)</ref>. This character remains one of the most useful microscopic criteria for separating species of Halimeda.</p><p>Howe <ref type="bibr">(1907)</ref> also suggested changes in nomenclature to take account of apparent priority of species authorship. He renamed incrassata with the epithet tridens, which he believed had priority. Barton had chosen the epithet incrassata when merging older species, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Collins (1901)</ref>, whose "Algae of Jamaica" preceded Barton's monograph by a few months, had chosen tridens for a similar merger. Howe's decision depended on Collins having correctly identified the type description of incrassata and tridens as being that referred to in a single publication by <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Ellis and Solander (1786)</ref>. The first author to merge species erected in a single earlier paper has priority of choice for the name to be used (International Rules of Nomenclature). Collins chose tridens; Barton chose incrassata; Collins chose first. <ref type="bibr">Borgesen (1911</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Borgesen ( , 1913</ref> put the merged species back to incrassata where Barton put it. This argument over naming the species has had the heritage that American and European workers gave the same species different names for much of this century. Americans followed Howe in using tridens and Europeans followed Borgesen and Barton in using incrassata. This confusion was only resolved with the monograph of <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis (1959)</ref>. In this it was demonstrated that incrassata is the appropriate name because Ellis, in his 1767 publication, included excellent illustrations, with analyses, of a "coralline" to which he applied the specific epithet <ref type="bibr">''incrassata'' (Fig. 12</ref>). This meets the requirements for valid publication as stated in the Paris Code <ref type="bibr">(Lanjouw et al., 1956, Article 43)</ref>. The original merger proposed by both <ref type="bibr">Collins</ref> and Barton is still accepted, and the name of the species is Halimeda incrassata and not H. tridens. <ref type="bibr">Borgesen's (1911</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Borgesen's ( , 1913</ref> interpretation of Caribbean material tended to parallel Howe's, yet refiected his own thinking. He considered that monile and simulans differed sufficiently from incrassata to be treated as separate taxa, but that they were only varieties of incrassata. These subspecies were considered of specific rank by <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis (1959)</ref>, as originally suggested by Howe. In this way Hillis' monograph resolved both differences of usage between America and Europe : the correct name for Barton's H. incrassata, and the specific status of H. monile and H. simulans.</p><p>The preceding brief account of the history of Halimeda shows that the major collections which had been examined critically by the 1930s had come, first from the Mediterranean, then the Dutch East Indies, followed by the West Indies. Not until the 1940s were concentrated studies made of Halimeda in Pacific atolls. The Japanese phycologist Yamada (1941) described a new species micronesica from the Caroline Islands. This taxon is particularly noteworthy because it possesses a fourth pattern of nodal medullary filaments (see discussion of f. ovata earlier on p. 29). The medullary filaments of this species do not fuse at the node, but pass unchanged, except for branching, from one segment to the next <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table III, Type 4)</ref>.</p><p>In 1946, William Randolph Taylor of the University of Michigan participated in "Operation Crossroads", the detailed scientific study of the Marshall Islands before and after atom bomb trials. Prominent in his collection of the vegetation of four of the atolls was a large and exciting series of Halimeda plants which were included in his book "Plants of Bikini" <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">(Taylor, 1950)</ref>. Some were new species, and one of them, fragilis, was a second species with unfused medullary filaments.</p><p>By 1950, then, the species total of Halimeda, counting monile and simulans as species rather than varieties, was about three times that accepted by <ref type="bibr">Barton.</ref> A quiet outburst of Halimeda data had occurred, and, as a result, Barton's monograph could no longer be used exclusively to study the Halimedae of any one region. It remained a useful introduction to the critical taxonomy of Halimeda, but was not the definitive work on the genus. In the mid-1950s Hillis, later publishing as Colinvaux and Hillis-Colinvaux, began working on Halimeda. Studying at the University of Michigan she had available the university's herbarium containing extensive collections from several Caribbean Islands as well as from the Marshall Islands. Curators of the New York Botanical Garden and the British Museum (Natural History) lent considerable portions of their large Halimeda holdings, the former collection containing much of <ref type="bibr">Howe's</ref> and some of Borgesen's material, the latter including important specimens examined by Barton, although the bulk of Siboga expedition material, housed in the Rijksherbarium, was examined several years later in Leiden. A loan from the University of California provided additional plants from Pacific reefs. The collections, supplemented with other important although smaller loans and some live material, provided about as extensive a world coverage as then existed, and formed a good basis for the investigation which led to a revision of Halimeda taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>, with the recognition of 21 species <ref type="table">(Table I)</ref>.</p><p>A weakness of the Hillis monograph is that important regions of the world, particularly the Indian Ocean, are poorly represented. This is because little collecting had been done in these regions up to the 1950s. Where phycologists had collected, their specimens provided little ecological information, so that the treatment of the data had to be without detail. In addition some type specimens and important collections could not be examined.</p><p>In the years since 1957 it has been possible to extend the work considerably in both traditional and new ways. The International Indian Ocean Expedition yielded good collections obtained by phycologists from new as well as familiar sites, and the new tool of scuba provided the opportunity of exploring and collecting in sites that grapple and dredge could not probe or penetrate. This led to the discovery of new species, including the first species of Halimeda with but a single medullary filament passing through the node ( Colinvaux and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Graham, 1964)</ref>, which represents a fifth nodal medullary filament pattern <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table III)</ref>.</p><p>Scuba diving, supplemented with skin diving and submersibles, actually enable us, at last, to see these organisms in their communities down to the limits of their depth range of approximately 100 m, and also to investigate and eventually to understand their role in the complex reef system. There have now been studies on the productivity of Halimeda in culture and on the reef, on the processes of calcification, on reef building, on ultrastructure and on ecology. This modern work is reviewed here and is added to with many unpublished data.</p><p>F. Summary: the evolution o/ Halimeda studies Halimeda was first known from the single species H. tuna that lives in the Mediterranean Sea, and this species continued to be the only one known for more than a century. The second, the familiar H. opuntia, was found by <ref type="bibr">Sloane (1707)</ref> in Jamaica. Only 8 of the species now accepted were known by the turn of this century, and most of the 30 species now accepted are discoveries of the last three decades. Halimeda, like so many other genera, was too easily split into many species on the basis of superficial surface features during the nineteenth century. The taxonomist who brought order to the genus was <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Barton (1901)</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15</ref>. A single medullary filament occurs in the node of H. cryptica, and the wall is much thicker in this region than elsewhere. The collar of smallish utricles from the upper segment which would surround much of the exposed filament has been dissected away. Scale bar is 100 (xm. (From <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Colinvaux and Graham, 1964.)</ref> the genus received its second monographic treatment by <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis (1959)</ref>.</p><p>A number of new species has been found since then.</p><p>Studies on the structural and functional biology of the genus were begun by the early microscopist Ellis, and for long had the result of producing arguments over whether Halimedae were plants or animals.</p><p>By 1842 this doubt was resolved, but little more structural work was undertaken until Barton's studies at the turn of this century. Functional and ecological studies had to await the demonstration that Halimeda would grow in culture <ref type="bibr">(Colin vaux et al., 1965)</ref> and the availability of modern diving techniques. This article is the first review of these functional and ecological studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Basis of the Taxonomy</head><p>The principal theme of this section is the Halimeda species. In it I am concerned with the more obvious ways in which the species vary and how they may be distinguished, rather than with precise details of how one species differs from another. Details of species description, species synonymies and keys to species are therefore reserved for Section IV. Both types of data, however, are brought together in <ref type="table">Table X</ref>, which summarizes important characters for each of the currently recognized 30 species. The taxonomic information available up to the early 1960s also has been quantified and incorporated into a system of numerical taxonomy developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">Rogers and Fleming (1964)</ref> who were then working at the New York Botanical Garden.</p><p>So that the genus may be considered in the framework of the green algae (Chlorophyta) and the plant kingdom, I include a discussion of taxonomic categories above the genus level.</p><p>A. The species <ref type="bibr">Barton</ref>, as a pioneer in the microscopic taxonomy of this genus, relied principally on one anatomical characteristic, the organization of filaments in a mature node, to distinguish the seven species of Halimeda she recognized <ref type="bibr">(1901)</ref>. However, with the splitting of some of these species, and the discovery and description of others, such heavy reliance on a single microscopic character is not possible. And if the many new species have validity-there are now over four times the number Barton recognized <ref type="table">(Table I)</ref>-it follows that reliable characters exist to separate them. For Halimeda many of these are known and tested, and as with most algae they are principally microscopic. However, I have found a few macroscopic characteristics to be reasonably dependable, and when they are combined with distributional data rehable field identification of some species is possible. These nonmicroscopic characters can, of course, also be used for laboratory determinations.</p><p>I describe macroscopic and microscopic characters in the subsections that follow, but reserve distributional and ecological data for Sections VIII and X respectively. All may be useful in delimiting groups of species, or individual ones. Specialized reproductive structures or gametangia are described in Section VII. They are not present on most of the material collected and so far have not contributed significantly to taxonomy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Macroscopic characters</head><p>Three characters are commonly used: appearance of segment ; appearance of holdfast ; appearance of thallus.</p><p>The first of these, segment appearance, is the original character used to separate and establish the early species of Halimeda (Section II). The other two were developed as key characters by <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis (1959)</ref>, so that some specimens could be identified in the field. All three, together with data on geographic and ecological distribution, are essentially the only characters available for the field determinations essential to any critical ecological study involving the genus.</p><p>(a) Segment pattern. The usefulness of the appearance of segments to species identification may rightly be questioned when one recalls the early taxonomic confusion created by relying on this characteristic.</p><p>From direct observation of extensive collections of dried material one is well aware that the segments, even of a single thallus, may be highly variable in shape and size, and species such as incrassata and opuntia are good examples.</p><p>Such doubts are further strengthened by evidence that some variability is environmentally induced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Techet (1908)</ref>, for example, attributed the changed shape of the segments of Mediterranean tuna, when kept in laboratory tanks, to reduced salinity. In some of their culture studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Colinvaux et al. (1965)</ref> observed a marked change in the segments ofdiscoidea which may be a response to reduced light intensity.</p><p>I have also noted a considerable reduction in the size, as well as change in shape of the segments oi gigas growing in aquaria ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16</ref>). My field observations have also indicated changes of shape in response to environmental factors. The dwarf opuntia growing shallowly in a fastflowing inter-island channel of Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands is a good example. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16</ref>. Some of the variability which iTiay occur in segment size and shape shown for H. gigas. Portions of the typical segments, which are reniform to discoidal and very large ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 39)</ref>, appear in the bottom of the picture, particularly the right-hand corner. The remainder of the segments, which are predominantly cuneate, were produced in culture at light intensities of approximately 125 ft-c. The tips of several of the segments have the whitish cone -like extensions of medullary filaments, indicating that new segments are forming. Scale bar is 10 mm.</p><p>Variations, therefore, do occur. The important point is that the variations do fall fairly well within the range recognizable for each species. I have found that size, shape, texture (and occasionallycolour) of segments may, with care, be used in species identification. One can easily see, for example, that the segments oi macroloba and lacrimosa are very different from those of incrassata or opuntia <ref type="bibr">(Figs 28,</ref><ref type="bibr">45,</ref><ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">19</ref>, respectively), and other examples can be found in a study of the species illustrations of Section IV. By contrast, the segments of incrassata and simulans or even of monile and cylindracea may be so similar that identification by segment appearance alone is not reliable.</p><p>The shape of segments may be spherical, to cylindrical, to flattened, with the upper margin of broad flattened segments entire, undulating or lobed, and the lower margin cuneate to auriculate. In size, the range extenss from the small (2-5 mm), tear-shaped segments of lacrimosa to H 0.1mm <ref type="bibr">Fig. 17</ref>.

Each polygon or circle represents the surface of a peripheral (primary) utricle, and is the tip of the cortical branch system. Some of the variations which occur with age are shown in <ref type="bibr">Nos. 14,</ref><ref type="bibr">18</ref>, 20 and 23. Taxonomic characters shown include size; whether the utricles adhere laterally, or separate as in Nos. 10, 13, 16 and 19, or remain somewhat attached but separate easily as in Nos. 14, 17, 24 and 25; the presence of spines.

At the left is the upper portion of a regular segment with part of the cortex included. To the right of it are parts of the small "cushion" segment which is corticated, and the uncorticated stalk region. One or both may be present, and commonly neither occurs. The pattern of medullary filaments at the node, shown at the juncture of regular and cushion segments, is that of fusion in twos and threes, with the participating filaments remaining fused. The entangled condition of the filaments just below the region of fusion adds to the difficulty of nodal dissection. The base of a regular segment, without cortical detail, is shown at the right. <ref type="bibr">(From Hillis, 1959.)</ref> the broad flat ones of gigas, which may measure to about 31 mm in length and 42 mm in breadth.</p><p>Thickness of segments varies with the number and height of the inner cortical layers, and often decreases from base to apex within a plant. This gradient reflects the relative ages of segments, with older segments towards the base, youngest at the branch tips. Some segments are ribbed, others plane, and the surface of macrophysa and favulosa often appears pitted or stippled because of the large diameters and separateness of their peripheral utricles <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 17,</ref><ref type="bibr">Nos. 16,</ref><ref type="bibr">24)</ref>. The species cuneata is unusual in that a small "cushion" segment or an uncorticated "stalk" region, or both, may be interposed between a node and the next regular segment above <ref type="bibr">(Figs 18,</ref><ref type="bibr">61)</ref>.</p><p>Colour is influenced by the amount of calcification, proceeding from green to white or yellowish-brown as calcium carbonate increases with age.

(From <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis, 1959.)</ref> character, is rarely useful except in living specimens of scabra and micronesica, which ma}^both have a pronounced bluish cast. In some species the degree of calcification appears noticeablydifferent between deep and shallow forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Goreau, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Bohm, 1973a; Section IX), and species such as fragilis, gracilis, lacrimosa and hikinensis usually seem considerably more calcified than cuneata or lacunalis. Finally, the shape of basal segments may be noticeably different from the shape predominating in upper portions of the thallus. This is most marked in micronesica where the lowermost segment is usually several times larger than the other segments and very irregular in outline <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 46</ref>). In members of the incrassata group several of the lowermost segments may remain unbranched, producing a caulescent effect, or adjacent basal segments may consolidate laterally forming a rather massive fan-shaped structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 12</ref>).</p><p>(b) Holdfast style. Appearance of the holdfast is a character which is more useful in delimiting groups of species than in identifying individual ones, and is correlated, to some extent at least, with type of substrate.</p><p>Holdfasts of one group of species <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> are conspicuous and bulbous. They consist of a mass of loose filaments to which particles of substrate freely adhere, so that the structure looks like cemented conglomerate of sand. These holdfasts range in length from about 1 cm to over 13 cm. Halimedae with these holdfasts belong to the Rhipsalis section of the genus (Section IV), a group which contains all the species growing on unconsolidated substrates. Thalli with such holdfasts represent less than one-quarter of the described species, but as a group are the most readily separated. It is possible to find Rhipsalian Halimedae attached to rocks or cobbles, usually where there is a thin layer of sand over the stone. The holdfast is then likely to be at the small end of the size range, but is still definite and is usually clearly separable from Halimedae with holdfasts of the remaining types.</p><p>Most Halimedae are attached to a firm, generally stable substrate such as coral rock. The holdfast is usually less than 1 cm long, is frequently inconspicuous, and may be missing from the specimen unless the thallus has been carefully collected. Holdfasts are commonly lacking in dredged material, for example. These smaller holdfasts often appear as orangey-brown, rather tightly compressed mats (e.g. tuna). The mats can be peeled off the rock substrate, though the operation is delicate.</p><p>In some of these holdfasts the filaments remain loose so that the plant appears to be attached to the rock by a random web of fine string.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(i) Multi-holdfast species.</formula><p>In a few species there is a complex system of attachments in place of a single holdfast. There are two multi-holdfast systems: the "rope-like extensions" of micronesiva, and a system of adventitious attachment found in spreading and cushion life-forms. <ref type="bibr">Fig. 19</ref>. H. opuntia, festooning Acropora sp. on the reefs of the Similan Islands, eastern Indian Ocean. The spreading thallus is anchored at several places, and the older parts of the thallus (shown near the centre) die away and become sejaarated from the younger portions, producing a clone of several younger thalli. The multi-holdfast system is a useful growth strategy-for a clone that may be grazed. Long dimension of the clump in right-centre is approximately 7 cm. "Rope-like extensions" were described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis (1959)</ref> for micronesica. Fine rhizoidal-type filaments extend from several apical segments and become intertwined into ropes which attach to the substrate. Halimeda micronesica plants may be held down bj^an orange-brown mat of these ropes which may be up to 6 cm or more in In several species the basal point of attachment is poorly developed and may be difficult to locate, particularly in dried material. Instead, where some of the branches touch the substrate fine rhizoidal filaments may develop, giving attachment. This pattern may occur together with a spreading type of growth where thallus branches along crevices, or over and around coral heads. Adventitious holdfasts occur in some plants oi opuntia <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 19</ref>), distorta, gracilis and copiosa.</p><p>(c) Habit and growth form. The habit of the various species may be erect, pendant, prostrate or spreading, and may be distinctive for certain species such as the flaccid straggling thalli of the typical gracilis, the pendant form of a number of species of the Halimeda section (Section IV), or the generally erect pattern of members of the Rhipsalis. The axis of new growth is predominantly vertical for thalli with erect or pendant habits, horizontal for those that are prostrate or spreading. Some members of the section Opuntia, with their sprawling habit, may exhibit both horizontal and vertical axes of strong growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Microscopic characters</head><p>Three main sets of microscopic characters are useful in the taxonomy of Halimeda. They are : pattern of medullary filaments at the node <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table III ; Figs 3, 15)</ref> ; size and appearance of primary, secondary and tertiary utricles <ref type="bibr">(Figs 17,</ref><ref type="bibr">20)</ref>; pattern of cortex, and extent of its development <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 20)</ref>.</p><p>The use of these characters almost always requires the magnification of low and high powers ( x 10 and x 40) of a compound microscope, preceded by selection and preparation of the material.</p><p>(a) Choice of segments for examination. In using these characters to identify Halimedae, it is important to select only mature segments from the plant. In so doing much of the variation which is the product of growth rather than of the individual species is avoided. The ideal segment for examination is free of epiphytes and usually is about the middle of the thallus. Material from such a location is nearly always old enough to be reasonably calcified, but has not developed various features of aged or senescent segments which could mislead. The variations I describe herein and the range of measurements given in this section and in Section IV are from such "mature" segments. Some of the changes associated with yet older segments are also included in the account if they can be used in species identification.</p><p>(b) Preparation of mMer'ial (i) For nodal structure. Generally all the required information can be obtained by removing from the nodal region a thin rectangular strip approximately 6 mm long, 1-5 mm broad and the thickness of the segments included. The long axis of the rectangular strip should be along an imaginary line connecting nodes of sequential segments. The sample should include a small portion of the segments adjoining the node. If material is scarce, as it generally is with herbarium specimens, one can generally manage with only part of a node. By such parsimonious tactics, adjoining segments remain attached and the continuity of the thallus is maintained. If material is ample, as generous a strip can be cut as is desired. This rectangular strip may be sectioned or dissected.</p><p>For routine taxonomic examination the information on nodal structure often can be obtained from sections, and I prefer this approach because one frequently can obtain data on other microscopic characteristics from the same preparation.</p><p>A satisfactory technique is to section the strip lengthwise on a smooth card with a razor blade, using the short edge of a microscope slide as a guiding edge.</p><p>With a slightly moistened needle transfer the sections to a drop of water on a slide, decalcify with about 20% hydrochloric acid, remove excess acid with a tissue, and resuspend the sections in water. This sometimes is sufficient preparation, particularly if the material is living, and all that is needed before examining with a compound microscope is to add a coverslip. The slides subsequently may be made semi-permanent by infiltrating with glycerine or another medium if desired.</p><p>With some types of nodal structure, and with dried thin specimens, some teasing or dissecting apart of deflated filaments in the sections, with fine needles or fine pins such as insect mounting pins, is required before examining.</p><p>Entire nodes also may be decalcified and dissected for the required information. This technique is the obvious one for a species such as cryptica with only one nodal filament. For some species, however, the resultant numbers of filaments make elucidating the structure more difficult than working from sections.</p><p>(ii) For surface of peripheral utricles. The diameters of the peripheral (primary) utricles and siu-face detail are obtained from a li. HILLIS-COLINVAUX thin slice of a bit of surface from about the centre of a segment. Place it in a drop of water on a slide making certain the outer surface is outermost, decalcify with 20% hydrochloric acid, drain excess acid with a tissue and refloat in water. The preparation is ready for examining with a compound microscope.</p><p>(iii) For inner utricles and development of cortex. Much of this information can be obtained from the same sections prepared for nodal examination if the rectangular strip removed extends sufficiently deeply in the segment below the node sampled. However, if a nodal sample was not made, cut a similarly shaped piece, oriented along the same axis, from slightly above the centre of the selected segment. Section and prepare according to the instructions for nodal preparation.</p><p>(c) Pattern of medullary filaments at the node. The character of medullary filament pattern at the node was referred to at some length in Section II because it is essentially the only character used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Barton (1901)</ref> in her taxonomy. The discussion herein involves their interpretation and use in modern Halimeda taxonomy.</p><p>The three patterns <ref type="bibr">Barton recognized are :</ref> the filaments all fuse together in a single unit for a short distance (about 1-1-5 times the diameter of the filament) and then separate; openings, pits or pores develop in the walls between adjacent filaments ; filaments fuse for a short distance in pairs and then separate ; filaments fuse completely in twos or threes and do not separate therafter (although the filaments continue their branching pattern).</p><p>With <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">Yamada's (1941)</ref> new species a fourth category was needed:</p><p>filaments remain separate throughout the node.</p><p>A fifth type <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Colinvaux and Graham, 1964)</ref> has been added:</p><p>node composed of a single filament.</p><p>Until the discovery of cryptica all known species of Halimeda were multiaxial, that is they possessed a core of medullary filaments. Species with this fifth pattern of nodal filaments are uniaxial.</p><p>The study of nodal anatomy can be as tedious and difficult as Taylor (1950) understandingly writes, and it should not be surprising that the structure one is seeking to unravel is not always clear cut. <ref type="bibr">Since</ref> Barton's publication in 1901, many hundreds of Halimedae have been examined, and many new species recognized. The effect has been not only to add new categories of nodal pattern, but also to extend or modify the definition of patterns already recognized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ECOLOGY AND TAXONOMY OF Holimeda</head><p>The most difficult categories are the second and third which involve fusion of filaments in small groups, and they have sometimes been considered subunits of but one category <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">(Taylor, 1950;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis, 1959)</ref>. However, with the many additional species now placed in these categories this treatment no longer seems appropriate. In spite of apparent overlap, the two categories are distinct and should be considered of equal importance to the others. It has been necessary, however, to modify their definition. These new, or extended definitions have been used in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table III</ref> which is an illustrated listing of the five patterns, together with the species in which they are found. Modifications and variations are discussed below.</p><p>(i) Further definition of second and third patterns of nodal filaments, and their variations. In both categories fusion may be for a very short distance (approximately 1-5 times the filament diameter) or may be complete, with the participating filaments continuing as one filament which subsequently branches. These sometimes are referred to as "short" and "complete" fusion respectively.</p><p>In both categories the fusion may involve units of up to six filaments, and possibly more <ref type="bibr">(Colinvaux, 1968a, and unpublished)</ref>.</p><p>In both categories the occasional filament may remain separate.</p><p>Such anomalous behaviour is perhaps most likely in filaments with a peripheral position <ref type="bibr">(Colinvaux, 1968a, and unpublished)</ref>.</p><p>Also, in certain species of both categories the fused units may adhere laterally, giving the impression of fusion into large bundles. Such adhesion may be demonstrated by teasing apart the units. This can be done with care, and the filament walls remain intact <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Colinvaux, 1968a</ref>).</p><p>However, in species of the second category, which is delimited <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table III)</ref> as "filaments mostly fuse in pairs for a short distance", this is the predominant type of nodal filament pattern. In addition, the participating filaments generally are not intricately intertwined before fusion. Therefore, the pattern "definite short fusion in pairs by most or all of the filaments, with participating filaments very little entangled" is diagnostic, whenever observed, for the species listed, that is, for the entire section Opuntia (Section IV).</p><p>Category three now is delimited as "filaments fusing in small groups, commonly twos or threes, for a short distance (approximately 1-5 times the filament diameter) or completely; filaments are frequently mucn intermeshed before fusing" <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table III)</ref>. This category contains the greatest number of species, is the most variable, and its species are often the most tedious to dissect. The nodes may contain a more or less equal mixture of "short" and "complete" fusion units, or completely </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">"W*-^-\ \r«&gt;»" ";•"&gt;"' w =^" 'iii'^»»j5ir\ y^-''^&gt;-s IC 0) rJŝ I o -J C .

The participating filaments may be so interlaced that the structure is very difficult to sort out, and the whole may be further complicated by the fused units firmly adhering for a length approximately equal to the diameter of a filament <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>, so that initially one feels that all the filaments are fused together as in pattern one.</p><p>Variations in the other three categories of nodal filaments. For most species of the first group (filaments fusing into a single unit) nodal structure is unequivocable. The pores associated with this pattern of filaments generally show up well if good longitudinal sections are made. The pores are lined up in adjacent filaments, and all the filaments appear to be involved in the fusion. Diagnosis for such material is straightforward. Occasionally, however, particularly in material of simulans, the pores may be small and relatively inconspicuous <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>. And in some specimens the connections between some of the filaments may be delicate and easily broken, giving the impression that the nodal structure is that of two or three large groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis (1959)</ref> reported this for monile. Occasionally, in monile two or three separate bundles of fused filaments occur.</p><p>The fourth group (separate filaments) is essentially uncomplicated, except that the filaments may adhere, usually only slightly, and then have to be gently teased apart without tearing, to establish the absence of fusion. In melanesica a very few filaments may join briefly in pairs.</p><p>The fifth category (a single filament) is straightforward. ; type and extent of lateral adhesion of adjacent utricles; number borne by a single secondary utricle.</p><p>Length of these utricles, although usually given in species descriptions, has not proved useful taxonomically.</p><p>For the first two of the characters surface sections are required ; tor the remainder, longitudinal sections are used. In three species surface characteristics are so outstanding that these microscopic characters may be checked in the field without magnification, or with a X 10 handlens, and the identification subsequently verified in the laboratory. These species are scahra, macrophysa a,nd favulosa.</p><p>(i) Identification without a microscope. In scabra the surface of each peripheral utricle is prolonged into a spine <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 20</ref>, No. 4), a feature which occurs in no other Halimeda. Consequently, thalli of this species without a surface growth of epiphytes feel slightly rough. This character may be used, with extreme caution, to distinguish scabra from tuna in the field. Halimeda scabra may be often bypassed in Caribbean reefs where it grows because it is considered to be tuna. Field identification should be checked with a handlens or (preferably) a microscope to verify the presence of spines. A lateral view (as in a longitudinal section) is preferred.</p><p>Halimeda macrophysa can be tentatively identified in the field by the very finely stippled appearance of the segment surface <ref type="figure">(Fig. 40</ref>). This pattern results from exceedingly large surface utricles which are round rather than hexagonal in appearance <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 17,</ref><ref type="bibr">No. 16)</ref> and are separated by calcium carbonate partitions. However, if a first-time field identification for a given site is made this way, it should be verified microscopically .</p><p>Halimeda favulosa may give somewhat the same impression as macrophysa. The diameters of its surface utricles are larger, but the calcium carbonate partitions are not as complete. The two species cannot be confused because they look different macroscopically, and there is no overlap of distribution.</p><p>An awareness of this characteristic for favulosa may ease its being mistaken, and therefore bypassed in the reef, for incrassata which is considerably commoner.</p><p>(ii) Surface diameter of peripheral utricles. The surface diameters of the peripheral (primary) utricles together with their surface appearance are, perhaps, the most useful characters for separating Halimeda species at the microscopic level, and surface preparations are the most easily made. With x 100 magnification these utricles generally appear as a "sheet of polygons" or like a honeycomb. Sometimes the units are roundish, and then may be disconnected rather than united into a "sheet". High-power magnification ( x 400) is usually required for accurate measurement.</p><p>The range in diameters is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 17</ref>. The smallest occur in species of section Opuntia ; the largest are in the species favulosa.</p><p>(iii) Surface appearance of peripheral utricles. The predominant surface pattern of the peripheral utricles is hexagonal ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 17)</ref>, a result of the pressing together of the many branch tips of the cortical filament system. In some species such as macrophysa, the separateness of the utricles is maintained by relatively thick deposits of calcium carbonate between utricles, and the utricles retain their roundness. Intermediate <ref type="figure">Fig. 20</ref>. Sagittal sections through an outer portion of about the middle of a Halimeda segment to show different characteristics of the cortical utricles, and of the extent of development of the cortex. A portion of the medulla is included in each. Important characters for the primary utricles are the extent of their lateral attachment, which ranges from about half their length in Nos. 10 and 11 to a thin platform-like edge in Nos. 9 and 12, to none at all in Nos. 1, 8 and sometimes 20; and the number of peripheral utricles supported by each secondary utricle, which ranges from 1, 2 or 4 in No. 20 to 14 in No. 11 and 18 in No. 12, but the usual number for most species is 2 or 4. (All the utricles supported cannot be shown in a two-dimensional drawing, but the range is apparent.)</p><p>Useful taxonomic characters of the secondary and tertiary (inner) utricles include shape, diameter and length. In diameter, the largest secondary utricles are the bullate ones of discoidea <ref type="bibr">(No. 11)</ref>. Numbers 12, 9 and 3 are swollen at their peripheral ends. The tertiary utricles of No. 14 are diagnostic, except for some regional specimens of discoidea which have a swollen tertiary layer (see text).</p><p>There are two general patterns of development of the cortex. Most species have conditions occur in other species where the calcium carbonate deposits do not extend as completely to the surface and some of the utricles are slightly attached to each other.</p><p>An illusion of roundness seems to be produced by preparations from a few species, especially gracilis and lacrimosa. However, by focusing up and down with the microscope, very faint hexagonal lines can generally be observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>. The appearance seems to result both from the slightly convex outer surface of the peripheral utricles and by adjacent utricles touching only very slightly. There are other variations. The walls appear somewhat thicker in stuposa and cylindracea for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>, and in velasquezii and cylindracea the "covering lamella" (Section I) of the outer surface of the peripheral utricles <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">(Taylor, 1962</ref>, for velasquezii; Borowitzka and Larkum, 1977, for cylindracea; both using the term "cuticle") appears to be more prominent than in some other species. This may also vary with condition of the material.</p><p>Yet another variation occurs in cuneata, discoidea, gigas, taenicola, tuna and sometimes other species, in the occasional lateral fusion of adjacent utricles in twos, threes and rarely fours <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 17,</ref><ref type="bibr">Nos. 11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fig. 20,</ref><ref type="bibr">Nos. 5,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref>). This fusion is distinct from adhesion, the usual pattern, where the utricles retain their individual walls. Adjacent peripheral utricles usually adhere where they touch. In cylindracea, and very possibly all of the species, this appears to be brought about by the fusion of the covering lamellae of the participating utricles <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Borowitzka and Larkum, 1977)</ref>. The remainder of the filament walls in the region of contact generally retain their distinctiveness, although there are exceptions as noted in Subsection (iii).</p><p>The extent, or length, of the adhesion ranges from none (macrophysa, fragilis and often favulosa) to about half their length [cuneata and discoidea; <ref type="figure">Fig. 20)</ref>. In lacrimosa and gracilis it is restricted to a thin distinct utricles (are utriculiform) ; but in species of section Opuntia and a few other species the utricles, formed by dichotomous branching, are not swollen or specialized, and hence appear like regular branch&amp;s. This type of cortical development is shown in Nos.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis, 1959.)</ref> platform-like edge of the utricle <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>, so that these utricles may separate readily after decalcification if the coverslip over the preparation is pressed gently.</p><p>The degree of adhesion also varies somewhat with the age of the segment. In some species at least, the utricles, while adhering in young and mature segments, may separate readily in old yellowish or whitish basal segments <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>, and sometimes in mature segments as well <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 17</ref>).</p><p>(v) Number of peripheral utricles supported by a secondary utricle.</p><p>Longitudinal sections (Subsection 2.b.iii) are required to observe this character, and some of the range is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 20</ref>.</p><p>Usually 2 or 4 peripheral utricles are supported by each secondary utricle. In favulosa, however, sometimes only one is borne on a secondary utricle, in bikinensis and gracilis up to 8 frequently may be so supported, with as many as 14 in discoidea and 18 in lacrimosa.</p><p>Numbers between 2 and 8 occasionally occur in species in which 2 or 4</p><p>are usual <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>.</p><p>(e) Shape, diameter and length of inner utricles. Inner utricles show up in longitudinal sections like those described in Subsection 2.b.iii. They are best seen at x 100 magnification when they appear rather like expanded sacs, or sometimes as continuations of filaments, between the outermost (primary) utricles and the longitudinally oriented medullary filaments. Striking differences in shape and diameter are apparent in different species, and length may also be a useful parameter. Highpower magnification ( x 400) should be used in measuring the diameters of the inner utricles at the small end of the size range. Utricle diameter is measured at what is usually the broadest part, just below the insertion of the primary utricles.</p><p>The most dramatic secondary utricles are the greatly swollen "bullate" utricles of the Atlantic discoidea <ref type="figure">(Fig. 20</ref>, No. 11), and in these plants usually only two layers of utricles, the peripheral and secondary, are present. In Pacific-Mexican and Hawaiian discoidea, a third or tertiary layer of utricles is commonly present and then the secondary utricles are less conspicuous and at the lower end of the size range <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Howe, 1911;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis, 1959</ref>).</p><p>Other distinctive secondary utricles are those of lacrimosa, and to a lesser extent gracilis <ref type="figure">(Fig. 20</ref>, Nos. 12 and 9, respectively). Those of lacrimosa are frequently very long and are much swollen at their peripheral end. Those of gracilis are of a similar style, long and swollen, but the amount of distension at the peripheral end is considerably less and sometimes almost imperceptible <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959</ref>, and Section IV).</p><p>It is the tertiary utricles of taenicola that are swollen and distinctive <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 20,</ref><ref type="bibr">No. 14)</ref>, rather like the secondary utricles oi discoidea <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">(Taylor, 1950</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis, 1959</ref> Length of the inner utricles in some species varies considerably with the age of the material or the number of layers of utricles. It is therefore generally not a helpful character.</p><p>(f ) Pattern and extent of inner cortex. For many species the distinctiveness of the inner cortex lies as much in the pattern formed by the inner utricles (inner cortex) as a whole, as in the initial distinctiveness of secondary or tertiary utricles. The pattern may be observed in sagittal sections ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 20</ref>).</p><p>There are two general patterns of development of the cortex <ref type="bibr">(Hillis, 1959, and Fig. 20)</ref>.</p><p>The branching and rebranching of the lateral filaments may be accompanied by generally pronounced constrictions and wall thickening at the sites of branching, and swelling of the intervening regions. These swollen regions form the distinctive utricles. Branching to form the inner utricles is generally tri-or tetrachotomous.</p><p>The branching and rebranching of the lateral filaments is dichotomous, and is not accompanied by pronounced constrictions at sites of branching, or by swelling of the intervening regions. The utricles appear like continuations of the branches.</p><p>The second of these patterns occurs in the Opuntia group of species (nodal filaments mostly fusing in pairs for a short distance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Colinvaux, 1968a)</ref>, as well as in the sections Micronesicae (except for melanesica) and Crypticae (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table III</ref> for species included and later (overleaf) for a discussion of sections). Somewhat modified, it also appears in gracilis, lacrimosa and bikinerisis.</p><p>The first pattern occurs in members of section Rhipsalis and many members of section Halimeda. In members of the Rhipsalis except for favulosa, the diameters of the utricles become progressively larger proceeding towards the medulla.</p><p>(i) Extent of inner cortex. The number of layers of utricles in the cortex may be a helpful taxonomic character for some determinations, although this character is more variable than many of the others.</p><p>The number of layers ranges from two to five, rarely six, with two usual in discoidea, gigas and macrophysa, and five in opuntia and some of the species belonging to section Rhipsalis. Exceptions include the presence of a third layer in some material of discoidea (Subsection (e) above), and sometimes only two layers in lacunalis, where usually there are three.</p><p>Extent of the cortex also varies with other factors including age and location in the segment. The number of layers is generally fewer in young segments, and greater in old basal segments which are often greatly thickened. Their number frequently is reduced or they may be absent in the vicinity of the node <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6</ref>), with peripheral utricles then being supported directly by short, unmodified branches of the medullary filaments. And, in cryptica, a Caribbean species found often in heavily shaded crevices at depths of about 25 m or greater <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Colinvaux and Graham, 1964)</ref>, and which grows more openly in the reef to 100 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">(Moore et al., 1976)</ref>, the cortex of the under (umbral) surface is frequently somewhat atrophied. Asymmetry in cortical development between the two surfaces of a segment is not conspicuous in typical thalli of the other known Halimeda species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The genus and its sections</head><p>Although the pattern of nodal filaments can no longer be relied on almost exclusively for separating the species of Halimeda as Barton chose to do, it is helpful and reliable for recognizing groups of species. I became increasingly aware of the significance of this feature, as a kind of "master character", while working on my 1959 revision <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>, and in it referred to tuna and incrassata complexes. From continued herbarium studies, combined with more extensive field work, I have found that separation along these lines not only seems valid on the basis of phylogenetic implications, but also that each of these patterns of nodal filaments is frequently accompanied by other similarities. This seems especially true of a number of habit characters, and is well illustrated by species with the incrassata type of fusion <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table III</ref>, filaments fuse into a single unit), all of which possess a large bulbous holdfast and grow erect, or essentially so, in an unconsolidated substrate. These groups appear to represent natural units within Halimeda which should be recognized formally.</p><p>A meagre framework for sections within the genus exists in the extensive publication on algal systematics by Agardh (1887), in which four subcategories, Tunae, Pseudo-Opuntia, Opuntiae and Rhipsales, are indicated <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table IV)</ref>. De Toni (1889) called them sections and applied Agardh's descriptions to them. Since appearance of the segments is the major character used, it perhaps is not surprising that the categories, as delimited, do not seem meaningful or useful. They were not even mentioned a few years later by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Barton (1901</ref>  "Species mihi ignota H. discoidea."</p><p>" Species added by De Toni.</p><p>The obvious character around which sections of the genus Halimeda should evolve is that of medullary filament pattern at the nodes. This character is the most important one in the taxonomy of the genus, and so may be expected to reflect fundamental phyletic divergence. The five groupings given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table III</ref>, based on pattern of medullary filaments, provide a logical framework for sections of the genus. Consequently, I propose they be designated as sections, and called Rhipsalis, Opuntia, Halimeda, Micronesicae and Crypticae. The nodal structure on which they are based, and the species each contains, are shown in <ref type="table">Table V</ref>. Formal descriptions are given in Section IV.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">H w t&gt; O S cili PI M bC bc g ;3 A oo V g .-S Is "^- 1:2^"Ŝ^t 3 -ĝ cs rt =i " 2^CS r^t3õ o</formula><p>The first two section names are taken from Agardh with spelHng altered to the proper endings. The change from Tunae to Hahmeda is required by the International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature, since this section includes the type genus tuna. Agardh's fourth section, Pseudo-Opuntiae, to which he assigned gracilis and two species of uncertain identity, is redundant in this nodal filament system since gracilis has been included in section Halimeda. This name, therefore, is not used. Each of these three sections retains some of the species originally placed in it by <ref type="bibr">Agardh.</ref> The two new categories, Micronesicae and Crypticae, have each been given the epithet (with appropriate ending) of the first species described with the pattern of nodal filaments characteristic of that For all five sections the only character truly diagnostic is the pattern of the filaments at the nodes. However, a few other characters, some of them macroscopic, seem to be associated, fairly reliably, with the nodal groups. These also are given in <ref type="table">Table V.</ref> Finally, the original circumscription of the genus by Lamouroux (1812) described its construction as multiaxial ("axe fibreux"). This excludes the uniaxial species cryptica. Therefore, in Section IV, the genus description is extended to include uniaxial as well as multiaxial species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. The genus Halimeda in higher taxonomy</head><p>For the first few decades of the twentieth century Halimeda seemed securely placed in the order Siphonales. But just as taxonomy within the genus is changing to reflect new knowledge and concepts, so too is that above the genus level. New tools such as the electron microscope enable us to probe the structure of these algae more precisely, while improved culture and chemical techniques provide additional data on life-histories and chemical organization, and lead to new insights and evaluations of the position of Halimeda and its close relatives within the plant kingdom. A survey of some of the taxonomic changes is provided in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Chapman (1964)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Ducker (1967)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Egerod (1952)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Parker (1970)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">Round (1963</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b257">Round ( , 1971</ref>).</p><p>1. Classification of Halimeda in the early twentieth century When Barton wrote her monograph on Halimeda she considered the genus belonged to the "order Siphoneae in the group Chlorophyceae". The descriptive term for this designated order was first introduced into the algal literature by <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Greville (1830)</ref>, to delimit those green algae with "frond either composed of membranous, filiformis, single or branched tubes, or formed of a combination of similar tubes". It included the genera Codium, Bryopsis, Botrydium and Vaucheria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Blackman and Tansley (1902)</ref> formally established the order Siphonales for this group of plants which by then included Halimeda. They subdivided their new order Siphonales into two suborders, the Siphonocladeae for septate thalli, and the Siphoneae for those that were non-septate, that is, coenocytic. Soon afterwards <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">Oltmanns (1905)</ref> elevated the first group to order status <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">(Table VI)</ref>, leaving only true coenocytes in the Siphonales.</p><p>2. Subdivision of the Siphonales: Setchell and Feldmann <ref type="bibr" target="#b265">Setchell (1929)</ref>, in a discussion of the taxonomic position of Microdictyon, referred to the incorrectness of Siphonales as an ordinal name (since it was not based on the name of a genus), and mentioned, without discussion, that this order would be better separated into Codiales and Caulerpales.</p><p>Feldmann (1946) treated the subject considerably more substantially.</p><p>Building on the microscopical observations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Ernst (1904)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Czurda (1928)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Chadefaud (1941)</ref>, he pointed out that in some members of the Siphonales only one kind of plastid occurred, the chloroplast. Such genera he called homoplastic. In other genera of the Siphonales two kinds of plastid were present, the chloroplast and the starch-storing leucoplast or amyloplast. These genera were heteroplastic. The heteroplastic genera included Udotea, Pseudochlorodesmis and Halimeda, for which "les chloroplastes sont entierement depourvus d'amidon, I'amylogenese etant assuree uniquement par les leucoplastes".</p><p>Feldmann also noted a complete correlation between wall chemistry as worked out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Mirande (1913)</ref> and the nature of the plastids in the siphonaceous taxa that he had studied.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Feldmann's (1946)</ref>  To reflect these differences he proposed a division of the Siphonales into two new orders, the Eusiphonales (a name which was also untenable) and the Caulerpales. Taxa of the Eusiphonales were homoplastic and had a wall containing cellulose ; those of the Caulerpales were heteroplastic, and lacked cellulose in their walls. The division into families, and the genera assigned to them are included in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table VII</ref> which shows this subdivision of Siphonales.</p><p>Feldmann <ref type="bibr">(1954)</ref> developed this yet further when, on the basis of available life-history data, he divided his two orders of 1946 (Eusiphonales and Caulerpales) each into two more orders <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table VIII)</ref>. In doing so he abandoned the epithet Eusiphonales, thereby removing one nomenclatural problem.</p><p>From the Eusiphonales he separated the orders Derbesiales and Codiales. The Derbesiales were established as possessing a heteromorphic life-cycle, or a life-cycle in which the alternating gametophytic and sporophytic phases looked very different, and as a consequence may have been given different names. The culture studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">Kornmann (1938)</ref> provided some of the basic data, for Kornmann had observed the zoospores of Derhesia marina (Lyngbye) Sol., a small, branched filamentous alga, develop into plants identifiable as the sac-like Halicystis ovalis (Lyngbye) Aresch. And <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Feldmann (1950)</ref>, in the years subsequent to his 1946 paper on siphonalean taxonomy, had linked Derhesia tenuissima (De Not.) Crn. with Halicystis parvula <ref type="bibr">Schmitz.</ref> In contrast, members of the Codiales were known for a life-cycle in which there was only one free-living phase (haplobiontic) which was diploid in these algae. As another difference between the two new orders special gametangia developed on the filaments of members of the Codiales, whereas specialized structures did not occur in the Derbesiales, the entire thallus of the gamete-bearing phase, Derhesia, functioning as a gametangium.</p><p>The other two orders of <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Feldmann's (1954)</ref> paper were derived by separating the oogamous Dichotomosiphon tuherosus (A. Br.) Ernst, a freshwater filamentous alga, from the Caulerpales, and placing it in its own order because of this distinctive reproductive feature which is unknown in the rest of the Siphonales. In contrast, the Caulerpales, from the data then available on the life-histories of Caulerpa and Halimeda, produced gametes that were only slightly different (anisogamous). In addition, the entire contents of the thalli of these two genera were transformed into gametes when gametogenesis occurred, so that death of the plant followed sexual reproduction (holocarpy).</p><p>In both of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Feldmann (1946</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Feldmann ( , 1954</ref>) schemes the classification of Halimeda is in the family Udoteaceae of the order Caulerpales.  <ref type="bibr">(1963,</ref><ref type="bibr">1971</ref>) considered the classification of the Chlorophycophyta as a group, and his 1971 scheme is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 21</ref>. Only that part which impinges on Halimeda will be discussed.</p><p>The old order Siphonales is replaced by five orders, four of which are those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Feldmann (1954)</ref>. In the fifth, Phyllosiphonales, Round places the single genus Phyllosiphon, which, as he suggests, may belong to the Xanthophyceae. Ostreobium, which is commonly allied with Phyllosiphon and which would seem reasonable to include here, is mentioned with the Chlorochytriales. Families within these orders are not discussed in these papers.</p><p>Round <ref type="bibr">(1963,</ref><ref type="bibr">1971</ref>) places the siphonaceous orders in the separate class Bryopsidophyceae, and within the class recognizes the three groups or "cohorts" as he calls them, and which appropriately could be considered subclasses, of Hemisiphoniidae, Cystosiphoniidae and Eusiphoniidae, which were set up by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Chadefaud (1960)</ref> as Hemisiphonees, Eusiphonees cystosiphonees and Eusiphonees typiques. The orders within each are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 21</ref>. The Hemisiphoniidae, with walls dividing the thallus into multinucleate units, is the simplest of the three groups. Members of the Cystosiphoniidae produce cysts and may or may not have segregative division. Taxa belonging to Eusiphoniidae possess the additional carotenoid pigments siphonein and siphonoxanthin, have polysaccharides other than cellulose in their cell walls, and do not have the special characteristics of the other two groups.</p><p>(i) Advantages of Round's scheme. For siphonaceous algae the system of cohorts (subclasses) brings together three series of green algae with the multinucleate condition. The designation of a separate class (Bryopsidophyceae) for this group of three recognizes some of their distinctive differences from the other green algae, and seems particularly reasonable in a system which recognizes a number of classes of green algae (Zygemaphyceae, Oedogoniophyceae and Chlorophyceae). There are, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">Round (1971)</ref> summarizes, a number of important features in the Bryopsidophyceae such as pigments, wall chemistry and plastid structure which separate them from the class Chlorophyceae, but none of these embraces the class as a whole. <ref type="bibr">(b)</ref> Classification scheme of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Bold and Wynne (1978)</ref>. In their massive and splendidly comprehensive introductory text on the algae these two authors recognize 15 orders within the division Chlorophycophyta <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">(Table VI)</ref>. One of these, the Caulerpales, replaces the former "Siphonales" in such a scheme. Within it 7 famiUes are recognized: Derbesiaceae, Codiaceae, Bryopsidaceae, Udoteaceae, Caulerpaceae, Dichotomosiphonaceae and Phyllosiphonaceae.</p><p>(i) Advantages of the <ref type="bibr">Bold-Wynne scheme.</ref> The recent discoveries such as chloroplast organization and wall chemistry are clearly and well described in the text dealing with the Caulerpales, and the authors have avoided premature taxonomic changes by treating the order as a broad assemblage of a number of families.</p><p>(c) Validity of life-history, plastid and filament-wall data. There is the urge, as well as the goal in classification schemes, to present the interrelationships of the various categories and the evolutionary trends. The three criteria used by Feldmann <ref type="bibr">(1946,</ref><ref type="bibr">1954)</ref>, plastid structure, wall-chemistry and life-history data, appeared to provide such an approach for the truly siphonaceous algae.</p><p>In the intervening years, however, difficulties have developed with the use of each of these criteria. There also has been some support. <ref type="bibr">(i)</ref> Life-history data.</p><p>Culture studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Hustede (1964)</ref>, subsequently confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Rietema (1975)</ref>, have indicated that Bryopsis halymediae Berth, and Derbesia neglecta Berth., taxa placed in different orders by <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Feldmann (1954)</ref>, are alternate phases in the life-cycle of a single taxon. And <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Rietema (1969</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b252">Rietema ( , 1970</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Rietema ( , 1975</ref>, working with several populations of Bryopsis plumosa (Hudson) C. Ag. in culture, has obtained a second life-cycle phase, a microthallus which, depending on the population, produces the familiar Bryopsis thalli directly, or produces zoospores which give rise to the Bryopsis thallus.</p><p>The linking of Bryopsis sp. and Derbesia sp. in a single life-cycle, the presence of heteromorphic life-cycles in some members of the Codiales, and other life-history data do not support the recognition of two separate orders Codiales and Derbesiales using the life-history criteria of <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Feldmann (1954)</ref>. This conclusion was also reached by <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Rietema (1975</ref> In contrast, the life-history character <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Feldmann (1954)</ref> applied to the Caulerpales, holocarpy or the complete involvement of the thallus in the production of gametes and its death thereafter, has received some additional support. Feldmann could cite only two examples, Halimeda and Caulerpa, where such a pattern had been observed. Holocarpy has now been reported for Chlorodesmis <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Ducker, 1965)</ref>, Penicillus (Hillis- <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Meinesz, 1975)</ref> and Udotea <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Nizamuddin, 1963)</ref>. The one apparent modification is that holocarpy may involve only a portion of the thallus. In my laboratory aquaria I have occasionally observed Halimeda to produce the conspicuous grape -like clusters of gametangia on only one to two branches of the thallus, or a relatively small portion of the entire plant. Subsequently, it was only this part of the plant that died.</p><p>Although the entire thallus (or branch) is involved in this production of gametes, specialized gametangia are formed in the process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Feldmann (1951)</ref> had described them on a Mediterranean Halimeda. Hence his key character "holocarpie sans gametocystes individualises" is surprising, and is misleading for Halimeda, although appropriate for Caulerpa as currently known. For the Codiales he indicates "gametes . . . se formant dans des gametocystes individualises". The difference between the Codiales and Caulerpales, based on the available sexual thalli, is more appropriately described as the presence of a cross wall at the base of the gametangium in the Codiales, its absence in the Caulerpales.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(ii)</formula><p>Wall chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Parker (1970)</ref> provided a very useful review of wall chemistry which included this group of algae and presented the problems of using this character for taxonomy. Data available on Caulerpalean algae have shown [3-1,3-xylan to be a component of Caulerpa, Chlorodesmis, Halimeda and Udotea <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">(Miwa et al., 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Parker, 1970)</ref>. It also occurs in Penicillus, and in Dichotomosiphon, the only member of the Dichotomosiphonales of Feldmann's classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Frei and Preston, 1964)</ref>, as well as in algae that would not be assigned to either the Caulerpales or Dichotomosiphonales, such as Bryopsis sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">(Miwa et al, 1961;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Frei and Preston, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Maeda et al., 1966)</ref>. The complexity of wall chemistry and the difficulties of applying it broadly in the siphonaceous algae have recently been illustrated by the identification of different wall polysaccharides as predominating in alternating stages of the life-cycle of some taxa <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(Huizing and Rietema, 1975)</ref>. Their evidence showed a mannan (probably p-l,4-mannan) as the principal filament-wall polysaccharide of the sporophytic stages of Bryopsis plumosa (Huds.) C. Ag. and Derbesia tenuissima (De Not. in Mor. et De Not.)Crouan frat. <ref type="bibr">(Banyuls material)</ref>, and a xylan (probably p-l,3-xylan) and cellulose as predominant wall polysaccharides of the gametophytic stages of both genera.</p><p>The work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Huizing and Rietema (1975)</ref>, as they point out, does not support the division of the siphonaceous green algae into a "xylan group" (including Bryopsis) and a "mannan group" (including Derbesia and Codium) as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">Miwa et al. (1961)</ref> and adopted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Maeda and Nisizawa (1972)</ref>. However, the evidence so far available on wall chemistry in Caulerpalean genera <ref type="bibr">{sensu</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Feldmann, 1954)</ref> indicates that the p-l,3-xylan of their walls may be a consistent characteristic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">Round (1971)</ref> has accepted it as such. There is a need, however, to examine the walls of many more of the genera within the group, as well as of different species, particularly of Caulerpa where there is a range of chloroplast structure. The walls of holdfast filaments of different species oi Halimeda should also be examined, as well as those of the filament developing from zygotes (Section VII).</p><p>(iii) Plastid structure.</p><p>The presence of only one kind of plastid (the chloroplast) or of two kinds (chloroplast and amyloplast) with distinct photosynthetic and storage roles was the basis of <ref type="bibr">Feldmann's separation (1946)</ref> of Caulerpalean and non-Caulerpalean orders of siphonaceous algae.</p><p>Amyloplasts or starch-storing plastids have been demonstrated in species of Avrainvillea, Caulerpa, Chlorodesmis, Halimeda and Udotea <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Hori and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ueda, 1967, 1975)</ref>, and in Penicillus <ref type="bibr">(Turner and Friedman, 1974)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Hori and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ueda (1967, 1975</ref>) report their absence in species of Codium, Derhesia, Bryopsis and Pseudodichotomosiphon.

Workers who have made similar observations on one or more of the above taxa include Descomps (1965) on Caulerpa, Halimeda and Udotea; <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Dawes and Rhamstine (1967)</ref>  In general, the presence of the so-called "heteroplastid" system seems reasonably substantiated for the Caulerpa-Halimeda-Udotea series of algae, as does its absence in the Codium-Derhesia algae. However, as mentioned in Section I, there is some modification of Feldmann's original account.</p><p>Feldmann <ref type="bibr">(1946)</ref> indicated that some heteroplastic algae, Avrainvillea and Cladocephalus, have a starch-depositing pyrenoid in their chloroplasts, and that in Penicillus and Bhipocephalus the chloroplasts secrete several small grains of starch. However, in Udotea, Pseudo-cMorodesmis and Halimeda the chloroplasts "sont entierement depourvus d'amidon, I'amylogenese etant assuree uniquement par les leucoplastes".</p><p>At least for Halimeda this is not so, as has been indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">Wilbur et al. (1969)</ref>, Borowitza and Larkum <ref type="bibr">(1974b)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Colombo and Orsenigo (1977)</ref>. Starch, with and without pjrrenoids, also is present in the chloroplasts oi Caulerpa sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Feldmann, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Hori and Ueda, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Hori, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Calvert et al., 1976</ref>), a genus not discussed by Feldmann <ref type="bibr">(1946)</ref>. It seems likely that at least small grains of starch in chloroplasts may be fairly commonplace throughout the heteroplastic green algae, that their number or size may vary with the time of day, although not invariably (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Calvert et al. (1976)</ref> for behaviour in Caulerpa sp.), and that the real point of emphasis, as well as of interest, should be in the presence or absence of a separate starch-storing body (the amyloplast). The Caulerpa-Halimeda-Udotea algal series, then, has evolved a separate starch-storing plastid, whereas the Codium-Derhesia series does not use this starch storage plan, at least to any great extent.  <ref type="bibr">Borgesen)</ref> which was also morphologically unusual in lacking pinnae <ref type="bibr">(Huizing etal, 1979)</ref>); a life-history that involves the death of the alga (or the part of it involved) after sexual reproduction.</p><p>A fourth characteristic is valid for many of the taxa : the presence of chloroplast lamellar systems.</p><p>To reflect these differences I suggest the recognition, or retention, of a system of either four or two orders (depending on the classification The effect of my proposal is to unite the Codiales-Derbesiales group of <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Feldmann (1954)</ref>, which was also done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Rietema (1975)</ref>, with the name Derbesiales. The proposed scheme also recognizes the distinctiveness of the Caulerpa-Halimeda-Udotea series. Within the Caulerpales, I have followed, for the present, the traditional separation into two families, Caulerpaceae (which is monogeneric) and Udoteaceae, since we know very little about a number of genera in the Udoteaceae. One of the characters used to separate these two groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Bold and Wynne, 1978)</ref>, the presence of trabeculae or wall ingrowths in the filaments of Caulerpa, has been observed in the walls of the filaments of the segments of Halimeda tuna <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Borowitzka and Larkum, 1977</ref> The Gepps considered the calcified and uncalcified groups to have developed from calcified and uncalcified ancestors, and that they were "fundamentally and physiologically distinct", with their separation occurring far back in their developmental history.</p><p>This interpretation of evolution within the group has, as one of its weaknesses, the re-establishment of the two species of the type genus Flabellaria in the genus Udotea from whence the Gepps had removed them. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">MacRaild and Womersley (1974)</ref> have demonstrated the alternation of a calcified (aragonitic) with an uncalcified phase in the life-cycle of a single alga, the former Derhesia clavaeformis (J. Ag.)</p><p>De Toni, which they transferred to the new genus Pedobesia MacRaild and Womersley of the order Derbesiales. Such an alternation of calcified and uncalcified phases, which may prove to be more widespread, indicates that the Gepps' scheme is neither as useful nor as basic as the proposed separation along cytological and reproductive lines of the two orders Caulerpales and Derbesiales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Summary: the identification and classification of Halimeda</head><p>Many of the characters which separate the different species of Halimeda require the use of a compound microscope (magnification usually X 100 and x 400), and some prior sectioning, followed by decalcification of the material. Nonetheless, a few macroscopic characters are separated which, within limits, are helpful in field determinations of groups or taxonomic sections of species, and occasionally of species themselves. These are : the appearance of the plant as a whole, of the holdfast system, and the of majority of the segments. Finer determination of species, or of species groups, in the field is helped by a knowledge of their geographic range. Microscopic taxonomic characters which are most used are : pattern of medullary filaments at the node <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table III)</ref>, size and appearance of the different series of utricles <ref type="bibr">(Figs 17,</ref><ref type="bibr">20)</ref>, and pattern and extent of cortex <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 20)</ref>. All these characters vary somewhat with age and the position of the segment on the thallus. The specialized reproductive structures, the grape-like clusters of gametangia, do not occur on most material, and have not proved particularly useful in taxonomic work.</p><p>The different patterns of nodal filaments found in different groups of Halimeda species are useful in delimiting groups of species and are considered to reflect fundamental phyletic divergence. Five taxonomic sections of the genus are established using this character. They are RhipsaHs, Opuntia, Hahmeda, Micronesicae and Crypticae.</p><p>The presence of a special starch-storing body (amyloplast), xylan in the filament walls and a life-history that involves the death of the alga after sexual reproduction in the Caulerpa-Halimeda-Udotea group of algae, or at least in the genera examined, is the basis of a recommendation that this groap of algae be placed (or retained, depending on the system of classification) in an order Caulerpales which would be separate from an order Derbesiales containing Codium, Bryopsis, Derbesia and related genera.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Taxonomy of the Genus Halimeda Lamouroux</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Introduction</head><p>In this section descriptions are provided for 30 species of Halimeda, as well as for the genus. Two keys are given, one to all the species, the other to the Atlantic taxa together with a list of Atlantic species. A list of Indo-Pacific species is provided but not a separate key because over two-thirds of the species are present in that region.</p><p>In choosing key characters I have avoided as much as possible those which involve extensive preparation of material. Microscopic characters can be checked when the identification has been made. This approach precludes the necessity of detailed microscopy for a single species identification. Within the limits of reliability macroscopic characters are the first pair of choices, and at times it has seemed sufficient that such characters provide the sole choice. At other times they are supplemented with microscopic characters.</p><p>The characters used in the species descriptions and in the keys were described in Section III. Some of the figures and tables presented therein will be useful here as well, particularly <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 17</ref>, showing peripheral utricles in surface view ; <ref type="figure">Fig. 20</ref>, longitudinal sections of cortex ;</p><p>and The specimens examined for the Halimeda revision <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref> provided the nucleus consisting of the 451 "representative specimens" cited and many not cited because of limited space. All the iincited material represented overlaps in geographic range. Institutes providing these specimens were the herbaria of the University of Michigan, Ann principally from the eastern Indian Ocean, Jamaica and Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and the especially valuable experience of having made them myself, which has provided understanding of populations of the various species in the reef, including their variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Measurement of characters</head><p>The various dimensions recorded, both macroscopic and microscopic, have been obtained mostly from dried specimens, some from preserved material, a few from living plants. The measurements on the dried and on some preserved material are smaller than would be obtained using living plants, but for microscopic characters the effect of shrinkage on the measurements for taxonomic purposes is probably generally relatively little.</p><p>For the macroscopic character of segment dimensions, however, the change on drying may be considerable for large segments. In the species gigas, which has the largest segments in the genus, length and width data on two segments from living plants, measured a few hours after they were collected from the lagoon of Enewetak Atoll, were 31 x 36 mm and 20 x 36 mm. After drying, these segments measured 21 x 32 mm and 17x30 mm, respectively. Thickness may also be affected, and some segments, particularly those of many discoidea, macroloba and taenicola thalli, become conspicuously concave with drying. The change in all three dimensions is less dramatic with smaller, thinner segments.</p><p>Drying may occasionally collapse the filaments, particularly if segments are lightly calcified. For such specimens, it is very difficult to obtain good measurements from sagittal sections.</p><p>In the species descriptions of this section the principal measurements given are for the diameters of the peripheral utricles in surface view (from surface sections), the lengths of the peripheral utricles, the diameters of the secondary utricles and the diameters of the tertiary utricles (from longitudinal sections). For each specimen examined a minimum of ten measurements for each of these characters has been made, and very often more than twice that number, and at times two to several sets of preparations were made for each specimen. The precise number of measurements depends on the species, the reasons for examining it and the quality of the preparations. A good preparation of the surface of the peripheral utricles is usually relatively easy to make, and may have 100 or more utricles, depending on their size and how lavish one is with the specimen. With such a large sample the diameters of utricles were measured randomly, then the field specifically searched for the smallest and largest ones (fusions excepted).</p><p>In sagittal sections, the sample size per section is much more limited because there are many fewer utricles from which to choose initially, and of these some may not be fully expanded or may be damaged. As much as possible, the approach in measuring was the same as for the peripheral utricles.</p><p>For all but a few species the minimum number of measurements obtained for each of the microscopic characters is 100. The average for all species is well over 400, and for some species it is in the thousands.</p><p>The minimum number of nodes dissected for most species is 10, and for many species it is many times this.</p><p>These data provide a spread of measurements which are given in the species descriptions and synopsis <ref type="table">(Table X)</ref> as the range of measurements for the various characters. Figures in parentheses usually represent a few extreme measurements which are included to provide a concept of the range that may be encountered. The narrower range is the one considered representative of the species.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">•i '&gt;3 _2 &lt;s e e^g iS 3 I i 2Q Si o -^A gô X!^' &amp;-o rt tn -G°o 3 o S c3 O ® 03 5&gt; X^y, J -^? o p a PL| ® o o « ^ar&lt;3 •2 fi^g 05 IB H Ss o fi g M).2 « «. 2 '^i=i d -t^o S o *^H O 3 £ Co oo CO &amp;5 S 1=1 'S a&gt; 05 g°a pin^~-d * fl 'ô o g o o 9 o ® .a l^TS^0^_D O S s 'M -5 t2 O '01 ."t^.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Treatment of forms and varieties</head><p>In the 1959 revision I placed a number of forms in synonymy, and discussed them in the text of the pertinent species. These details, therefore, are available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis (1959)</ref>. Since then I have encountered a number of variants in the reef which could be described as forms of species. This is not unexpected since a wide range of variation has occurred in the appearance of the species grown in the laboratory, including that shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16</ref>. To provide many of these variants with separate names, however, seems of questionable value to the taxonomist as well as to the ecologist who is probably working with Halimedae living under a different set of reef conditions, showing variations that are similar, yet not the same. In time we may know enough about the habitat of the different species and the variations encountered within a region to separate forms or varieties meaningfully by habitat, but we do not yet have his information.</p></div>

Western and eastern Indian Ocean including the Red Sea; western Pacific, both north and south.</p><p>This species can usually be distinguished macroscopically from other Rhipsalian Halimedae by its broad, flat segments with distal margins usually very little lobed. These segments are relatively large, to 29 mm long and 40 mm broad, although in certain plants they do not exceed 1 1 mm in length and 20 mm in breadth. Histologically, the diameters of the utricles decrease towards the outer surface, those of the peripheral utricles being relatively small.</p><p>This species is at times confused with discoidea and taenicola, two members of section Halimeda. Although doubtful specimens can be readily identified on histological grounds, macroscopic criteria are usually adequate. These include the extent of development of the holdfast region, the general appearance of the basal part of the plant, and the size and appearance of the segments. In discoidea and taenicola, large segments, although often present, usually do not account for 50% or more of the segments as they often do in macroloba.</p><p>Of the Rhipsalian species, macroloba is most likely to be confused with borneensis because they both have relatively large, broad segments.</p><p>In general, those of macroloba has a less-lobed distal margin and are larger. The mature thallus of macroloba is also larger than that of borneensis, and it lacks the distinctive fan-shaped basal or suprabasal segment which is characteristic of most thalli of borneensis.</p><p>Microscopically, the diameters of the peripheral utricles oi borneensis tend to be somewhat larger than those of macroloba, and these utricles adhere, at least in some material, somewhat more firmly to each other.

Of these, the spreading system, which is somewhat loosely organized and composed of cylindrical and deeply trilobed segments or occasionally subcuneate ones, often produces discrete clumps of intense erect growth at intervals, in which flat, relatively broad segments with entire slightly lobed margins are often the most common.

This species, which was first described for the Mediterranean, has subsequently been attributed to most tropical areas. The specimens from these other regions, however, usually differ in one or more respects from the small-segmented Mediterranean plants which represent the type.</p><p>In habit, the typical small-segmented Mediterranean plants seem small and cushion-like, whereas specimens with small segments from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are often larger and less compact.

Subtropical; western Indian Ocean, both north and south; south-eastern Indian Ocean; south-western This species differs from all other species of the genus in the presence of what have been called "stalked" as opposed to "sessile" segments at the base of a few segments of the thallus. The "stalk" consists of either a small cushion segment or a stalk region or both.</p><p>The medullary filaments, subsequent to fusion in twos and threes in the node region of a typical segment, may extend into a "cushion" segment which consists of cortical layers as in a regular segment. However, the inner layers are usually not as regular in appearance or as extensively developed. In cushion segments near the base of the plant the cortex may be replaced by rhizoidal filaments. Such segments are readily recognized by their looser, rather disorganized appearance. The walls of the main filaments in cushion segments and often those of their branches are somewhat indurated. This is evident in section, and also in surface view of the peripheral utricles, although care must be taken in the latter to distinguish between actual thickening and the effects of shrinkage.</p><p>At the apex of these cushion segments, the medullary filaments commonly branch dichotomously, but may also remain unforked.</p><p>Either way they usually become torulose and proceed uncorticated for some distance. This represents the stalk. These filaments ultimately branch, generally trichotomously, and their rami develop the cortical layers of the new segment.</p><p>The preceding account describes the complete expression of the "stalk" region between segments. The extent of its development varies with the individual specimen, and it may be influenced by age since it was rather uncommon in the few young plants observed. Rarely does a plant occur without either of these structures being interposed between some of its segments.</p><p>A second prominent characteristic of H. cuneata is the extensive attachment of adjacent peripheral utricles which is for approximately 0-3-0-5 of their length. Extensive attachment, however, is not unique for cuneata. The peripheral utricles also adhere for a considerable distance in H. discoidea, and for somewhat shorter distances in H. tuna, and H. incrassata. When working with dried material this region is generally compressed and, as a result, the utricles may present the illusion in surface view of being thick-walled.</p><p>The concept of this species as presented by Barton was broad, and included both "stalked" and "sessile" plants such as discoidea. Hence, the reported geographic range of cuneata has sometimes been considerably extended as has been noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Gilbert (1947)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Papenfuss and Egerod (1957)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis (1959)</ref>.</p><p>Two forms of this species, f. digitata and f. undulata, have been designated <ref type="bibr">(Barton, 1901, p. 16</ref>, Plate 1, <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>, Plate 2, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>), the type specimens of which have not been located.

At Enewetak, the form f. lata was relatively common in the fast-flowing waters of an inter-island channel (Section X) where it grew erect on the seaward and leeward faces of the rock substrate, or protruded slightly from rock crevices. The thalli were also attached near the eroded bases of rock, under miniature overhangs. Dwarf forms of f. lata occurred at these sites also.</p><p>Halimeda lacunalis f. lacunalis was not encountered at these sites, and seems to be the rarer of the two.</p><p>Geographic distribution. For lacunalis f. lacunalis north-western Pacific Ocean; for f. lata western Indian Ocean; north-western Pacific Ocean. This species can be fairly readily distinguished from other Halimedae, except possibly cuneata, by the frequent occurrence of subcuneate or obovate segments. The absence of stalk or cushion segments separates it from this one species. Any confusion with discoidea or taenicola can be resolved microscopically by the absence of swollen secondary or tertiary utricles in lacunalis.</p><p>Histologically, the commonness of small secondary utricles is fairly characteristic of mature segments of this species. These small utricles are absent, however, when the cortex is composed of only two layers.</p><p>In other anatomical aspects lacunalis resembles tuna, particularly the Atlantic and Indian Ocean specimens. Features the two species have in common are the lateral adhesion of the nodal fusion units, the regular surface appearance of the peripheral utricles and the apparent absence of lateral fusions among them.</p><p>Halimeda lacunalis differs from tuna in the significantly smaller diameters of its peripheral utricles, with those of f. lata generally towards the lower limit of the broad tuna range.</p><p>The adherence of the nodal groups is usually fairly considerable, the rigidity of the resulting nodal structure sometimes leading to confusion with the Rhipsalian pattern. From this type of nodal union it is, nevertheless, entirely distinct, the units in lacunalis separating on teasing. Halimeda lacunalis also lacks the well-developed bulbous holdfast of Rhipsalian species.</p><p>Halimeda gigas W. R.

At Enewetak this species occupied microsites in the fast-flowing inter-island channels similar to those filled by lacunalis f. lata, but taenicola was less common.

Western Pacific Ocean, both north and south.</p><p>In general form, taenicola frequently appears like a Caribbean discoidea with thick segments, from which it can sometimes be distinguished macroscopically by its trapezoidal-shaped segments which are often somewhat greenish on drying. Thalh oi discoidea often possess relatively large discoidal segments which dry to a brownish colour. The segments of taenicola also appear to be somewhat more heavily calcified than those of discoidea.</p><p>Microscopically it also shows resemblances to discoidea, with the rather characteristically expanded utricles of the innermost, usually tertiary, layer of the cortex, although somewhat smaller in average diameter, suggesting the secondary utricles of discoidea. In taenicola these utricles often support five or six relatively small secondary utricles, as opposed to only four or two which are the more usual numbers for most species with a three-layered cortex. Occasionally the intermediate zone may be absent, but this rarely happens uniformly throughout the segment.</p><p>In more basal segments of taenicola an additional layer of utricles is frequently present, the length of the peripheral and secondary utricles is often greater, and the breadth of the innermost utricles is towards the lower limit of the range. These modifications, however, occur fairly commonly throughout the genus.</p><p>Microscopically, taenicola differs from discoidea in the somewhat smaller surface diameters of the peripheral utricles, these averaging 57 fxm in taenicola and 65 ixm in discoidea. Other differences include the relatively fewer lateral fusions of these utricles, and the degree of their lateral attachment, which in taenicola is approximately half that occurring in discoidea. Although the basic nodal structure is similar in these two species, incomplete fusion is considerably commoner in discoidea with the fusion groups at most adhering only slightly. In taenicola groups of fused filaments adhere for an appreciable distance.</p><p>The external appearance of this species sometimes leads to confusion with macroloha. These two species can be distinguished macroscopically on the basis of the bulbous holdfast and the somewhat fused condition of the basal or suprabasal segments in macroloba. These features are absent in taenicola. Histologically also, the two species are entirely distinct. The peripheral utricles in macroloha often separate after decalcification, and the pattern of its nodal filaments is that of the section Rhipsalis.</p><p>Halimeda bikinensis Taylor <ref type="figure">Figure 43</ref>.</p><p>Halimeda bikinensis <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">Taylor (1950)</ref>, p. 87, Plate 48, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Hillis (1959)</ref>, p. 358, Plates 2, 5, 6, 10.</p><p>Plants erect, moderately compact or somewhat loose, arising from a small holdfast region, to 20 cm tall; calcification relatively heavy; branching somewhat sparse with up to four or five segments and occasionally more arising from a single one; basal segments subcylindrical, subcuneate to subreniform, the three to four lowermost ones often devoid of branches; the otliers brittle, sometimes discoid but more commonly subreniform to reniform with subcuneate segments frequently occurring at the bases of the branches, the outer margin entire or slightly undulating, frequently raised and infolded, measuring to 16 mm long, 25 mm broad, and averaging 0-7-1 -0 mm in thickness.</p><p>Cortex of two to three layers of utricles produced by dichotomies in the Nodal medullary filaments occasionally remaining separate but more commonly uniting in twos and threes, the fusions within these units being complete or incomplete; fusion units not particularly entangled, and at most adhering only slightly.</p><p>Type specimen.

A number of well-defined distinctions exist for bikinensis, however, including the greater degree of calcification of its segments, the dichotomous nature of the inner cortex, the smaller surface diameters of the peripheral utricles, and the relative ease of separation of these utricles. This last characteristic varies somewhat with age.</p><p>Microscopically, this species appears to have most in common with gracilis and lacrimosa. Characteristic of these two species and most particularly lacrimosa are the somewhat swollen apical ends of the secondary utricles which in turn support several, usually 6-18, peripheral utricles. These are absent in bikinensis, although the appearance is somewhat simulated by some of the broader secondary utricles which may bear up to eight peripheral utricles rather than the more usual two or four.</p><p>Halimeda gracilis Harvey ex J.

H. gracilis showing a more compact, broader segmented habit than that in <ref type="figure">Fig. 44a</ref> This species seems closely related to lacrimosa and probably also to bikinensis. From bikinensis, a taxon of relatively compact specimens with large segments, to 16 mm long and 25 mm broad, gracilis is often readily distinguished by its loose straggling habit which reaches a length of 1 m or more, and by its smaller segments, to 9 mm long and 15 mm broad. In contrast, plants of lacrimosa reach about 5 cm in length and are composed of spherical or tear-shaped segments rather than flat ones.</p><p>Although gracilis is pantropical, its known distribution is extremely limited as compared to that of discoidea or opuntia. The paucity of records can be partly attributed to the relatively frequent misidentifications of material of this species as opuntia, and less commonly as incrassata or tuna. Identity problems can be resolved microscopically because nodal medullary filament pattern and appearance of the cortical layers are both distinctive for gracilis.</p><p>The peripheral utricles in plants of this species may initially appear rounded in surface view and give the impression of being separate. A more careful examination, however, usually reveals that they are at least slightly attached, though often by only the thin platform-like extensions of the outer surface. The different optical properties of these edges and the slightly convex outer face of the utricles combine to produce the illusion of roundness. These edges, in addition, may sometimes create the impression of a matrix, perhaps formed of the covering lamella, surrounding the utricles. This may represent the condition described by Barton for some of these plants.</p><p>Four infraspecific categories have been designated for this species : V. opuntioides <ref type="bibr">(Borgesen, 1911)</ref>, f. laxa <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Barton, 1901)</ref>, f. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">(Yamada, 1941)</ref>, and f. lata <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">(Taylor, 1950)</ref>. The latter has been transferred to lacunalis <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>.

This delicate species is readily distinguished from all other species of the genus by its small size and by the presence of spherical or pyriform (tear-shaped) segments. It shares with one of the commonest growth forms of gracilis, apparently the most closely related species, several features including a lax decumbent habit and an essentially dichotomous inner cortex. The general appearance and degree of attachment of the peripheral utricles are also common to the two species.</p><p>Microscopically, lacrimosa is characterized by capitate secondary utricles which appear circular in cross-section and support up to 18 peripheral utricles. The pattern of nodal medullary filaments is complex, and is perhaps best interpreted as a combination of short and complete fusion with, for example, two filaments sometimes resulting from a fusion of three or four. The usual type of complete fusion also occurs.</p><p>The restricted distribution of this species may be partly accounted for by the ease with which such small specimens are overlooked.

In all four species the cortex is formed essentially by dichotomous branching of the lateral medullary filaments and thus internally there are also similarities. Difficulties in macroscopic determination, however, can always be resolved by an examination of the nodal medullary filaments which remain separate in fragilis, but fuse in twos and threes in the other species. The separate peripheral utricles in fragilis are also distinctive. In bikinensis the peripheral utricles separate only with pressure, whereas they generally remain attached in opuntia and gracilis.</p><p>From micronesica, a second species in which the nodal filaments remain separate, fragilis can be distinguished macroscopically by its heavier calcification and by its often complanate branching. In addition, the segments are somewhat thicker, larger, more brittle and commonly reniform in shape rather than discoid or trilobed, and the lowermost segment is usually smaller than the others rather than being generally much larger and flabellate as is tjrpical for micronesica.</p></div>

Less striking but equally characteristic of cryptica is the especial delicacy of the nodes, an expression of this species' uniaxial construction <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs 3, 15</ref>). All other described Halimedae are multiaxial <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959</ref>). Smallish utricles from the upper, and to a lesser extent from the lower, of two adjoining segments form a collar <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref> which almost covers the medullary filament at the node, and produces the beaked or stalked macroscopic appearance of the upper of the segments.</p><p>The lighted and umbral surfaces of mature segments can be readily distinguished microscopically also. The peripheral cortical utricles of the umbral surface generally seem delicate. They collapse easily, and seem to become detached readily from the secondary utricles. To observe them satisfactorily the mature segments must usually be very slowly decalcified. Preparations to show the surface of the peripheral utricles of the umbral surface are more easily made from immature segments. In contrast, the peripheral utricles of the lighted sm^face and of the edge of the segment continuing slightly into the umbral surface are well developed, and retain their shape on decalcification as do those of other Halimeda species. The plastids in the material studied were generally conspicuously denser in the utricles of the hghted surface.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. Culture</head><p>Serious attempts to culture Halimedae and their relatives apparently date from the 1960s. <ref type="bibr" target="#b290">Techet (1908)</ref> showed that tuna could be kept in aquaria supplied with seawater at a marine station. In addition, very many coral reef organisms, including Halimedae, were kept for short times in aquaria at the Discovery Bay Laboratory in Jamaica by Dr T. F. Goreau in the early 1960s. This suggested that HaHmedae could be grown in aquaria, if necessary, far from the sea. This has been done <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Colinvaux et al., 1965)</ref>, and Halimedae have been maintained at inland laboratories for over two years, in both natural and artificial seawater. with the production of more than one vegetative generation. Only the completion of the sexual cycle, with the development of the characteristic segmented thallus from the loose filaments obtained by the germination of zygotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Meinesz, 1972b)</ref>, still remains to be carried out in culture.</p><p>The basic approach, which can be modified in many ways to suit facilities and the particular problem being investigated, is given in the following subsections. Considerably more elaborate arrangements are possible and may at times be feasible, but much can be done simply.</p><p>Halimedae and their calcareous relatives such as Penicillus, Udotea, Bhipocephalus, Acetabularia and Batophora all seem relatively hardy. They can be transported for several days in dim light and at temperatures of 20°C or less, and still grow satisfactorily in the laboratory.</p><p>It is not yet possible to begin Halimeda cultures with clean zygotes, not only because fertile plants of most species are hard to find, but also because it is not yet known how to germinate and grow the mature thallus from zygotes. It is only with tuna from the Mediterranean that development beyond the zygote has been obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Meinesz, 1972b)</ref>, and this has not been the adult plant as we know it (Section VII). It is necessary, therefore, to begin cultures with direct transplants from the sea, a procedure that unavoidably introduces troublesome contaminants into the cultures. The basic procedure is to collect good field material, to clean it by hand, to plant it in simple aquaria, to bubble air into the water, to provide light and to combat epiphjrtes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Field procedure</head><p>It is obviously important to select healthy vigorous specimens; the difficulty is to identify the signs of vigour and health. It seems natural to avoid thalli with segments which tend to fall off when touched, with white segments, or with large numbers of epiphytes. The thalli selected should be collected with minimal damage to the holdfast, and rock-growing species should have a portion of the rock to which the holdfast is attached included if possible.</p><p>After collecting, the thalli are carefully cleaned of as much associated plant or animal material as is possible without breaking the segment surface or pulling away the holdfast filaments. Then, until the algae can be transported to home base, they are maintained in three to four times their volume of clear seawater at about 24-25°C with a bubbler, and exposed to diffuse light. For travel, the water is replaced with fresh clean seawater, the amount being decreased to that manageable for the journey, and the containers closed. If accessible, compressed air is bubbled in at this stage. Large heavy-gauge plastic bags are useful for separating different collections, those with and without attached pieces of rock, for example. The bags can then be tied off and arranged carefully in stjrrofoam chests to minimize damage. Buckets with fitted lids and collapsible carboys are also suitable containers, and can be carried in the pressurized cabins of aircraft. About 50 sand-dwelling Halimedae can be transported in a 4-5 1 carboy half-full of seawater. They survive up to 3 days of travel in this way.</p><p>The algae are replanted as soon as possible after arrival. If time and facilities permit, it is a good plan to check for smaller epiphytes with a dissecting microscope and remove them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Basic laboratory 'procedure</head><p>The Halimedae are grown in closed aquaria without recirculating water, lighted for part of the day, provided with about 2-5 cm of calcareous gravel, and equipped with an air bubbler <ref type="figure">(Fig. 50)</ref>. Sanddwelling forms with bulbous holdfasts are simply planted in aquaria containing about 2-5 cm of sand over the calcareous gravel. Rockattached forms are anchored to the bottom or suspended from an arrangement of rocks or pieces of clean dead coral in a manner that resembles their normal growth habit. Species with a sprawling growth pattern such as opuntia are merely placed in an aquarium without sand but which usually contams chunks of rock or coral <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 51)</ref>. The aquaria are covered with glass or a thin sheet of transparent plastic.</p><p>The thalli are regularly cleaned by hand of epiphytes and animals as far as is possible without damaging them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Culture medium</head><p>Natural seawater and the commercial artificial seawater "Instant Ocean" have been the main media used.</p><p>Natural seawater is collected from areas free of wastes and filtered through a Millipore filter with average pore size 0-45^m.</p><p>Commercial artificial seawaters were not available when I first started culturing. They are now readily obtainable, however, and have proved as satisfactory for this work as natural seawater. The composition of "Instant Ocean" is given in <ref type="table">Table XL Some minor elements</ref> are missing from it, but results seem comparable to those with natural seawater.</p><p>No nutrients are added directly to either medium in routine culturing. Some nutrients are probably introduced by the sand substrates, <ref type="figure">Fig. 50</ref> When the aquaria are filled with seawater to the desired level and the plants added, the level of the medium is marked on each aquarium wall. Water evaporated from the system is replaced every few days by topping up to the level marked with distilled or glass-distilled water. This maintains a constant volume and accordingly a constant salinity. If the aquaria are maintained for six months or longer, the salinity is monitored. The seawater is siphoned out and replaced every six to nine months.</p><p>2. Substrates (a) Unconsolidated. About 2-5 cm of a calcareous material and another 2' 5 cm of a readily available sand are used, with, for convenience, the larger-grained material providing the bottom layer.</p><p>Suitable calcareous materials are quartz gravel, calcareous filtrant material as used in many aquarium systems, Halimeda sand and pieces of cuttle bone. The first two can be obtained from aquarium suppliers, and the second one, the calcareous filtrant, is also available from the suppliers of "Instant Ocean". Halimeda sand is collected in the reef. Cuttle bone, which is only practicable on a small scale, can usually be obtained from pet shops. Before being used the rock is washed, and autoclaved for 20 minutes at 15 lb pressure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Aquaria</head><p>The most used sizes have been 9-5, 11-5 and 191 aquaria which preferably are all-glass. These small sizes are manoeuvrable, and growth can be readily seen and photographed from all sides. Height is a critical dimension in selecting aquaria. One that is too shallow will seriously restrict the size of the thalli selected. A 30 cm height or slightly more would seem close to the ideal unless one is working only with small squat species. This height permits a reasonably thick sand-gravel layer as well as air space at the top which decreases the amount of water bubbling over from changes of pressure in compressed air lines of the circulation system.</p><p>Between uses, aquaria are scrubbed with 10% hydrochloric acid, then filled with tap water and allowed to stand for at least 24 hours. This operation is repeated at least twice more. If possible aquaria are not reused immediately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Circulation system</head><p>In the small 11-51 aquaria used most frequently, circulation is provided by aquarium air-bubblers, sometimes with the addition of an outside or inside water-filtermg system. Long air bubblers (approximately 14 cm) are connected to a compressed air system by Teflon tubing. An air-filter system of glass-wool is interposed, and a manifold is used so that several aquaria may feed off the system. Rate of flow to individual aquaria is regulated by C-clamps on the Teflon leads to each aquarium. The particular bubblers used function well after autoclaving.</p><p>A closedcircuit water-filtering system is sometimes used by adding the standard inside or outside aquarium filter, fitted only with glasswool, which fits against the vertical walls of the aquaria. Bottom or under-gravel filters might be feasible for Halimedae which grow on rocks or sprawl but are not suitable for sand-growing species. The Rhipsalian Halimedae do not normally have water circulating past their holdfast systems, which, in some reef sites, even grow in an anoxic environment. The reducing environment may facilitate the exchange of certain ions between substrate and holdfast, with such reactions bemg important to the successful growth of these particular species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Kinsman (1964)</ref> gives a range of 25-29°C as the temperature at which reef corals best flourish, while indicating that these organisms can withstand limited exposure to 16-17°C, and that some corals contmue to grow at temperatures as high as 36°C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Temperature control</head><p>For Halimeda, temperatures of 27-29°C are probably about optimal, although these plants are exposed to higher and lower temperatures in the reef. A range of approximately 25-29°C is acceptable.</p><p>Lighting will increase the water temperature of the small aquaria by 2°C and more, depending on the intensity and duration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Light intensity and cycle</head><p>Light intensities for much of the Halimeda culturing have ranged from 375 to 780 foot-candles, measured just above the sand-water interface. Intensities as low as 100 ft-c have been used, but growth is very slow or absent.</p><p>Lighting on a 12-hour light : 12-hour dark cycle is provided by cool-white fluorescent light placed about 22 cm above the aquaria. The lighting cycle was chosen because it is that of the tropics.</p><p>The lower intensities of this range were initially chosen because they were similar to those commonly used in algal culture including work with siphonaceous algae. <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">Puiseux-Dao (1970)</ref> gives a range of approximately 100-300 ft-c for Acetabularia, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Chen and Jacobs (1966)</ref> used 100 ft-c in their culture of Caulerpa.</p><p>Better growth is obtained, at least initially, at intensities such as 700 ft-c. This improvement is often paralleled by increased epiphy-te growth, and the epiphytes can become very difficult to control. The water of small self-contained aquaria also becomes overheated at the higher intensities, necessitating a cooling system.</p><p>Light intensities of approximately 375-500 ft-c are somewhat of a compromise in the range given. Growth as well as vegetative and sexual reproduction occur at these intensities. It is realized, however, that they are considerably below the light intensities of the shallow reef, some of which are recorded in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table XII</ref>, using a Gossen Tri-Lux foot-candle meter in an underwater case at two of our north shore Jamaican work sites, Runaway Bay and Glory Be (Section X). They indicate that plants growing atl-5m to -2m receive approximately 47-73% of the surface light which, on three sunny Jamaican days, about midday, averaged 7530 ft-c.</p><p>It is realized too that the unusual segment shapes often obtained in culture ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Colinvaux et al., 1965, Fig.</ref> 3) may be the result of growing these plants in intensities equivalent to those of the bluelighted regions in the reef at about -40 m to -50 m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Epiphyte control</head><p>A wide range of organisms, plant and animal, are introduced on the cleaned Halimedae thalli. A number of them grow very well in the system, and if uncontrolled will usually overgrow the Halimeda population eventually. Some of the introduced organisms also grow on the sand and rock substrates, as well as on the glass sides of the aquaria.</p><p>Epiphyte control is important for aquaria which will be maintained longer than about six weeks, and for shorter-term aquaria when light intensities are 1000 ft-c or higher.</p><p>The contaminant plants include a number of soft red and green, as well as blue-green, algae. There have also been occasional dense dinofiagellate blooms.</p><p>Phytoplankton blooms, if troublesome, can be controlled by changing the water and using a filter system. Since some inoculum remains on the Halimedae and on the sand or rock substrate, the improvement may only be temporary. with Weston light meter, Enewetak Atoll " For description of sites see Section X. '' Intensities were measured with a Gossen Tri-Lux foot-candle meter in an underwater case.</p><p>The most successful method for controlling the other epiphytes, once established, has been by hand cleaning, an operation which is tedious and time-consuming. The soft red and green algae can usually be plucked off their hosts fairly easily, but many of the blue-greens, with their slimy coatings and mats, must be scraped off, using tools such as a fingernail for the thalli, or a long-handled aquarium cleaner with razor blade for the sides of the aquarium. Tissues also are helpful for cleaning aquarium sides and retaining some of the material. Mats and slime coatings on the sand can be lifted off.</p><p>External or internal water filters, which may be initially useful for avoiding phytoplankton blooms or eliminating or minimizing successful development of new organisms from released zoospores or gametes, are of minimum help in controlling attached organisms, a number of which reproduce by non-motile means.</p><p>Other methods tried include the use of the invertebrate poison Lindane, and the antibiotic Penicillin. Lindane had previously been found helpful in Ulva culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b281">(Strand et al., 1966)</ref>. Halimedae were immersed for 15 minutes in seawater containing Lindane at a concentration of 15 parts per million. The results for the limited number of thalli available for experimental treatment were inconclusive.</p><p>For the testing of Penicillin the antibiotic was added to two aquaria at a concentration of 1000 units ml"^for one and 3000 units ml"^for the other. The higher concentration killed the vegetative stage of many epiphjrfces and they dropped off within the first two weeks. By the end of about two months, however, epiphytes, particularly blue-greens, were again abundant <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Hillis-Colinvaux, 1972)</ref>. When the treatment was repeated, it was not as effective. Penicillin may be helpful in short-term epiphyte control, particularly if added to the medium initially.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">New approaches to epiphyte control</head><p>Two additional techniques could be helpful. Sand-growing species might initially be planted in trays which could then be transferred out of one aquarium to a cleaner one, or used for experimental purposes. The trays could also be suspended over bottom filters smce the circulation pattern would not then interfere with any reducing environment established by the holdfasts in the trays.</p><p>Epiphjrte-free stock also can provide cleaner cultures. One source of such plants is the young Halimedae developing in the aquaria by vegetative multiplication. They can be successfully transplanted into fresh aquaria. Another potential source of clean thalli are mdividuals produced by regeneration. The basic procedure is to remove branches of several segments from robust thalli by cutting at the node (where there are fewer filaments), briefly pressing the cut ends together to induce wall formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Jacobs, 1958)</ref>, thereby preventing excessive loss of cytoplasmic materials, and then anchoring or planting the cuttings in substrate. I have had limited success with such cuttings which have ranged from two to a dozen segments. The longer cuttings were the most successful, and although none grew into a large thallus (all tended to get overgrown with epiphytes), a few produced new plants from rhizoidal runners in the sand (Section VII), and others produced rhizoids and segments. 9. Controlled environment room A walk-in controlled environment room, if available, permits a finer control of both the temperature and lighting cycles, and some investigation of environmental effects which are not possible if aquaria are maintained in a multi-use room. Such a room, however, may restrict sizes of aquaria and intensity of lighting.</p><p>C. Some experiences with Halimeda culture <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table XIII</ref> lists the species of Halimeda cultured, together with other plants that have been introduced intentionally or inadvertently. In the reef, epiphytes are, at times, very evident on Halimeda.</p><p>Blue-green algae may cover much of the Halimeda thallus and contribute a coating or matting to the surrounding sand. Matheison et al. <ref type="bibr">(1971)</ref>, in a transect study at -17-3m to -21-5m in the Virgin Islands, reported 17 species of epiphytes, mostly red algae, on H. incrassata. These workers did not seriously include blue-green algae in their study, so Cyanophyta may have occurred as well. It may be that massive imposition of epiphytes is a hazard to which Halimeda populations are adapted, and that their reproductive and persistence strategies will be influenced by this recurrent event. It is also possible that patterns of grazing on the Halimeda beds may be reflected in blooms of epiphytes. That the phenomenon occurs in nature suggests that it is an ecosystem event of some significance. It is also one such event that we can study in our cultures.</p><p>A number of animals, introduced inadvertently with the thalli, live successfully in the culture systems described, and some of the grazers, particularly the snails, may clean the plants and aquaria of some growths. Introduced animals include tube worms, anemones and polychaetes, with occasional snails, bivalves and brittle stars. From time to time there also have been blooms of small medusae of about 2 mm diameter. What are presumed to be different species of opisthobranch molluscs, both identified as Elysia spp., have fed, one type on Tydemania, the other on Halimeda incrassata. The Tydemania lived only about three months, and too little is known of its growth pattern to have assessed the impact of Elysia grazing. However, the other Elysia, a lone specimen, appeared to feed mostly on one individual Halimeda although there were others of the same species in the aquarium. This it did for a year, when it was preserved and sent off for identification. During the year it was alive, new segments started to form many times on the host Halimeda plant, but they generally did not complete their development.</p><p>These observations show that it is possible to maintain simple marine grazing systems in the laboratory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Summary of Halimeda culturing</head><p>Eleven species of Halimeda have been grown in the laboratory, some through one or more vegetative generations, while individuals have been maintained for more than two years.</p><p>It is not yet possible to start cultures with clean zygotes since the segmented Halimeda has not been grown from them in the laboratory. Cultures, therefore, must be started with direct transplants from the sea, a technique that introduces troublesome contaminants.</p><p>The basic procedure is to collect good field material, to clean it by hand, to plant it in simple aquaria, to light it, to bubble air into the water and to combat epiphytes.</p><p>Other Caulerpacean and various Dasycladalean genera also grow satisfactorily in this system, as well as a number of inadvertently introduced animals, showing that it is possible to maintain simple marine grazing systems in the laboratory.</p><p>Although large numbers of epiphytes in laboratory culture usually lead to the swamping of Halimeda thalli, on the reef this may be a hazard to which Halimeda populations are adapted, and the reproductive and persistence strategies of Halimedae may be influenced by this recurrent population event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. Growth and Calcification</head><p>Patterns of growth in Halimedae must result in fronds which may be likened to strings of beads because each frond is a linear array of segments fastened at the nodes by a string-like structure of filaments.</p><p>This string-of-beads structure is constructed from a non-cellular syncitium. The segmental "beads" of each species tend to have characteristic shape, suggesting a rather refined system for controlling the web of growdng filaments ; and this system operates as nuclei are spread along the filament, without obvious physical separation of individual nuclear domain. Furthermore, the shape imposed on a filament becomes fixed in a matrix of mineral calcium carbonate. Clearly, there are interesting questions to ask about the patterns of growth in Halimedae that concern control of growth, rates of growth, maintenance of structure and the process of calcification.</p><p>One of the reasons Acetabularia, a relative ot Halimeda with a single nucleus instead of many, has yielded so many data about the nucleocytoplasmic control of growth is that it could be cultured. Halimeda can be easily grown too, if initial care is taken in obtaining clean starting plants. But nucleo-cytoplasmic and chemical aspects of its growth have not yet been approached. Our information on growth is at the thallus, filament and ultrastructural levels. The classical accounts of growth are basically three. Askenasy (1888) provided the first short description when he noted that after a "rest period" the nodal filaments of an apical segment produced filamentous extensions which branched many times. The branches in turn branched and rebranched to the tips or peripheral utricles, which adhered, forming an outer surface and, as a result a new segment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Barton's (1901)</ref> account of the development of a new segment varied from that of Askenasy only in the branching pattern of the medullary filaments. The initial branching was trichotomous, with the middle branch continuing as part of the medulla while the two side branches divided and redivided until they terminated in the peripheral utricles.</p><p>A demonstration of this pattern can be seen in cryptica <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs 3, 15</ref>) with its single medullary filament.</p><p>The first field datum on rate of growth was obtained about this time too, and appears to have been originally published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Barton (1901)</ref>. This was the observation by <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Finckh (1904)</ref>, at Funafuti, that a branch of Halimeda growing through a hole in a submerged board of wood on the reefs added three inches of height and thickness in six weeks, or 14'38 g of calcareous matter. Thereafter, until these algae were grown in the laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Colinvaux et al., 1965)</ref> little more was known about growth of Halimeda or, indeed, of any of the calcareous Caulerpales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Macroscopic growth</head><p>Much of the following account uses hitherto unpublished data and some reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Colinvaux et al. (1965)</ref>. It is based mostly on the species incrassata, simulans and monile from the Caribbean, and although many of the developments described have been observed in the field, all of the quantitative data, particularly those on rates, are of growth in laboratory culture at approximately 27°C, with light intensities mostly of 310-560 ft-c for 12 hours, followed by 12 hours of darkness. The only field study of some duration is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Merten (1971)</ref>, worldng in Guam. She reported growth rates m macroloba over a period of 10 months, and included some laboratory study of it as well. Like ina'assata, macroloba is a R.hipsalian Halimeda, but the appearance and size of its segments are very different <ref type="figure">(Figs 22 and 28, respectively)</ref>.</p><p>The maximum length x width x thickness measurements for an incrassata segment are 10 x 14 x 0-7 5-1-0 mm. For macroloba they are 29 X 40 X 1 mm. The two species also have different habitats within the reef, with macroloba seemingly restricted to water of -12 m or shallower and growing best in waters of -2 m or less.</p><p>In incrassata transplanted to the laboratory, the first obvious growth is usually in the holdfast, as delicate new filaments extend out into the surrounding medium. It can be readily observed in unplanted thalli lying horizontally in seawater. In thalli so arranged most of the first new rhizoidal growth is oriented downwards.</p><p>Within the next few days there are also obvious signs of the development of new segments, as white, conical protrusions appear from the apical edges of terminal segments <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs 16, 52, 53)</ref>. These are the extensions of the medullary filaments which branch and ramify as they grow. The branches develop into the cortical series of utricles of which the outermost ones are contiguous. Within about 24 hours, the albino protrusions from an apical segment develop a fairly complete, somewhat greenish segment. The outer surface, however, is spongy and disconnected, for the peripheral utricles have not yet formed a continuous outer surface. This separateness of the peripheral utricles is unlike the pattern encountered in mature segments of most species (Sections III, IV). The very young filaments of a segment, therefore, may have a different environment before and after being enclosed within the segment since at the earliest stages of growth they are in direct contact with seawater. The resulting closed or almost enclosed spaces may be important in calcification <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Colinvaux et al., 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b306">Wilbur et al.,</ref> 1969; Bohm and ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Borowitzka and</ref><ref type="bibr">Larkum, 1976a, b, c, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Borowitzka, 1977)</ref>. Within the next 12-24 hours or somewhat longer, adhesion of peripheral utricles occurs in most species at least, and it is at about this stage that the first granules of calcium carbonate appear.</p><p>The pattern of a segment, its length and width are essentially set within the first couple of days. Subsequent development is mostly in the calcification of the segment, with some change in thickness, depending on the location of the segment within the thallus and the species. </p><formula xml:id="formula_17">73^7 3 1^= ® « (D j3 H 03 rO -^-"4^b O0 3 ,â ? b-^S "^S 1ê &gt; &lt;S ® &gt; !zi S 1^&gt; CO cŜ 03 i^i -^g 2 0) lO -ti CO .£^&lt; M ,^ô in i2-"2 Si b OD 3 'So « 3 '^'bD &lt;E S D $ t31 &amp;-^- 73 &amp;, £ &gt; ® s b 73 O i,[i X &gt; 'T3 u Ô^^&lt; o</formula><p>In very old segments the peripheral utricles may separate more readily or may be somewhat thickened.</p><p>New segments may develop daily or every other day on each branch so that many new segments can be added in a relatively short time.</p><p>This growth pattern has been observed also with cylindracea, opuntia and gigas, growing in running seawater aquaria mamtained for three weeks in the roofed open-air wet laboratory of the Mid-Pacific Marine Laboratory at Enewetak.</p><p>The growth which occurred on two thalli of incrassata over a time span of 72 and 61 days is shown in <ref type="figure">Figs 52 and 53</ref>, respectively. Thirteen days after the photographic series was started for the plant of <ref type="figure">Fig. 52</ref> it had added 35 segments or 114 mm. Seventy-two days after the beginning of the series it has added 96 segments or 265 mm.

It seems likely that the incrassatae of the reef, when actively growing, may have a growth rate which is at least comparable to the best of those reported, that is, to 6 cm wk~^. <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Merten (1971)</ref>, in Guam, worked with 200 plants of macroloba in both field and laboratory environments. The average growth rates for her four populations followed the same pattern, and all four were of the same general order of magnitude. For the 200 plants she gives an average growth rate of 5-8 cm for the first month, and 1-5-3-0 cm for the other months, with the laboratory populations performing as well or slightly better than the three field populations in overall height, although the plants were less branched and the segments irregular. The higher rate obtained is of the same order of magnitude as the opportunistic growth measure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Finckh (1904)</ref> on an unknown species of Halimeda.</p><p>Marten's rates are lower than those given for the incrassata plants although three-quarters of her measurements were of reef plants, under supposedly good to optimal conditions of growth. The comparison may not be meanmgful, however. These are two widely distinct species of Halimeda and different growth rates can be expected. In addition, a linear measure is perhaps not the best for either comparing or measuring their growth, although for these two species it is considerably more meaningful than the number of segments produced.</p><p>This growth activity of relatively rapid segment formation has, in the laboratory, generally been followed by a quiescent period of a week or two to a month or more, in which no new segments form. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Goreau (1963)</ref>, observing a number of representative species of calcareous algae over a period of 15 months, also noted this pattern of growth in spurts in cultured Halimedae. A quiescent phase may be a laboratory phenomenon, although many of the thalli I have observed in the reef have not given the impression of active growth at that particular time. It also may be a species-related phenomenon. Merten (1971) calculated the life-span for the shallow-water macroloba populations she worked with to be four months. The pattern for them appeared to be one of growth, sexual reproduction and death.</p><p>Growth of many of the species has another component as well, that of "negative growth". Some of the mature segments turn white or yellowish, and eventually fall off, to be added to the calcareous sediments <ref type="figure">(Figs 52, 53</ref>). In culture their death and final dehiscence may take a month or so, depending upon the presence and extent of grazing activity, intensity of water flow around the thallus and weight of epiphytes. The first losses of segments are generally restricted to the apical portion of the thallus, and vigorous new branches generally develop to replace fallen ones <ref type="figure">(Figs 52, 53</ref>). Occasionally there has been a massive whitening in a laboratory aquarium, with the segments of the upper third or half of the thalli of an aquarium population falling off a week or so after transplanting. New branches routinely develop at these sites.</p><p>In some taxa this decay of segments or "negative growth" may occur just as commonly, or even more so, in basal portions. The species opuntia, and probably others with sprawling or prostrate habit such as macrophysa, micronesica, distorta, gracilis and possibly copiosa, at times show signs of decay in the lower regions of their thalli. The younger and more vigorous segments and branches above them have mitiated rhizoidal development and attachment and continue as separate plants when the older segments fall away. This pattern of growth thereby also functions as a method of vegetative reproduction. In some species or environments, thalli being buried in shifting sand behave similarly. The buried basal portions whiten and loosen, while a new holdfast system is established above them ; then new segments are produced by the apical branches of unburied portions (Section VII).</p><p>Some species, or the thalli of some sites, may not lose segments as part of their growth pattern. <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Merten (1971)</ref> does not mention segment loss in the Guam macroloba populations, but one would expect few losses if the life-span is four months. And <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Feldmann (1968)</ref>, writmg briefly of the Mediterranean tuna, speaks of ageing the thallus by the length of the branches. "Les mdividus bien developpes, qui presentent souvent 8 a 10 articles successifs, doivent done etre ages d'une dizaine d'annees."</p><p>This does not imply much loss ofsegments, if the growth rate is as implied.</p><p>Certainly dead whitish segments would be more apparent in the laboratory because they remain on the thallus rather than being removed by currents. It is possible, too, that they may be commoner in laboratory culture.</p><p>In a few incrassata I followed this pattern of gain and loss of segments several times for up to 2| years. During that time branches and segments closer and closer to the base of the thallus were shed, until all but a few basal segments had been lost. A stump, or markedly reduced thallus, remained which was composed of whitish or yellowish, very heavily calcified, segments. Holdfast filaments stopped growing, and the thallus stump was loose in the substrate. Eventually the remaining segments fell off, or the remnants of the alga toppled over, and that individual had died.</p><p>This pattern of growth is characterized by what could be called a "perennating thallus", from which new segments and branches arise.</p><p>This perennating thallus not only consists of a well-anchored holdfast, but also a few to several basal segments, together with a few vigorous segments possibly of a younger generation <ref type="figure">(Figs 52, 53</ref>, first photographs). Very reduced, old, basal portions do not appear to be able to develop new growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Growth axis</head><p>Depending upon the species, the addition of new segments may result mostly in either a horizontal or a vertical extension of the thallus.</p><p>In Rhipsalian species the main growth axis is vertical, and a thallus that is generally erect results. In gracilis the predommant axis is commonly horizontal and a spreading or creeping habit is produced. In opuntia and distorta both types of growth are common, and the resulting habit is frequently a spreading cushion of many centimetres thickness.</p><p>The size of the resulting thalli is partly determmed by this direction of growth, with mature erect thalli such as incrassata generally bemg shorter than mature pendant thalli such as copiosa, some plants of which are 1 m long <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Goreau and Goreau, 1973)</ref>. The confines of a spreading thallus such as opuntia are often exceedingly large. Hence, precise boundaries for this species may be difficult to determine, making field counts meaningless.</p><p>Halimeda, in its ability to continue adding to its thallus over a relatively long period of time, resembles Udotea which periodically resumes growth, adding onto the margins of its fan-shaped thallus <ref type="bibr">(Colmvaux et al., 1965)</ref> and Tydemania, which adds new glomeruli (unpublished data). Both genera differ from Penicillus <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Colinvaux et al., 1965)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Bhipocephalus (unpublished data)</ref> for which extensive new growth from the mature photosynthetic portion of the thallus is unusual. Although the filaments of the brush may elongate, another capitulum is not formed and the original thallus dies within a few months.</p><p>2. Perennating structures and the systems of <ref type="bibr">Raunkiaer and Feldmann Feldmann (1968)</ref> has modified for algae the <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">Raunkiaer (1934)</ref> system of classifying life-forms of terrestrial plants on the basis of the position of the perennating bud, but did not develop the system to define communities by life-form spectra as Raunkiaer did. This system may have little interest to contemporary community analysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b304">(Whittaker, 1975)</ref>, and this doubtful utility becomes apparent when we attempt to apply Feldmann's version to Halimeda. We find that a single species can behave as two or more of the categories.</p><p>A Halimeda with a perennating thallus as described earlier would fit the hemiphanerophyte category in <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Feldmann's (1968)</ref> description of life-forms, that is, only a part of the erect frond persisting. Some Atlantic populations of tuna appear to fall into this category. The Mediterranean tuna Feldmann considered a phanerophyte, that is, an alga in which the entire thallus functions as the perennatmg structure, and very young Halimeda thalli of many species after their initial bout of growth would also fit this category. What any system of classifying life-forms is bound to do is to recognize common adaptations to common environmental constraints. But these systems can easily mislead. <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">Raunkiaer (1934)</ref>, for instance, remarks on an absence of phanerophytes (essentially trees) from the tundra. This absence of trees in the Arctic may be accounted for by arguments based on heat balance, desiccation or maintenance of biomass, yet Raunkiaer's classification must have convinced many students that the critical difficulty is exposing buds to cold air, a proposition for which there is no evidence. In the same way there seems to be no reason for suggesting that the environmental range of a species of Halimeda is directly responsible for imposing a particular system of perennation. The showing in at least two of Feldmann's perennating taxa of a single species of Halimeda is evidence that this approach is of limited use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Some conclusions about macroscopic growth</head><p>Halimedae grow a segment at a time. A segment begins from the medullary (nodal) filaments of the preceding segment which grow out as whitish filaments. These filaments branch and rebranch forming first a whitish cone, then a segment-shaped mass of branching bundles of filaments. The tips of these outgrowing filaments become the peripheral utricles and the external surface of the plant. A new segment may be fairly completely formed in about a day. It turns noticeably green by the end of the second day, and by this time has started to calcify. The length and width of the segment are essentially fixed at this stage, but the segment becomes increasingly calcified with age within certain limits, and also may thicken somewhat. Several segments may be produced by a frond in a week, although this varies with the species. Rates of growth for some incrassata thalli of 6 1*4 mm wk"^were obtained.</p><p>The youngest segments are at the periphery of the plant, the oldest at the base. Therefore, a gradient of segment ages exists in the alga.</p><p>A Halimeda thallus may lose some fronds even as others are actively growing. The moribund segments first lose their colour, turn white, may attract epiphytes, then fall off, a process reminiscent of the shedding of leaves by terrestrial plants. The resulting Halimeda fitter is responsible for much of the mass of carbonate in coral reefs.</p><p>Whole Halimeda plants may die, and the process is essentially the same as the death of a frond. In addition, the holdfast becomes loose in the sand, if the species is a Rhipsalian one, because rhizoidal filaments have stopped growing. For species like incrassata, simulans and monile there seems to be a definite pattern of youth, growth, old age and death.</p><p>These thalli may persist, however, as offspring from asexual reproduction (Section VII). Spreading forms such as opuntia appear to persist as senile portions of the plant fall away only to he replaced in the spreading mass by younger fronds which make their own attachments to the substrate with rhizoids from between younger segments (Section V).</p><p>Halimeda thalli may appear senile and dehisce many of their segments only to regenerate later from the remaining segments and possibly from buried rhizoidal filaments (Section VII). These patterns of growth, life and death obviously raise questions of the strategies of Halimeda species. One of the most striking of the aspects of growth in Halimeda is that individual thalli have life-spans; they die like so many other organisms, after a life-span typical to the species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. UUrastructural events</head><p>The basic ultrastructure of Halimeda has been described in Section I.

This whole process takes about 24-48 hours, and seems to start early in the day or light cycle. In about the last 12 hours, which corresponds to the Adhesion of the peripheral utricles also takes place at about this time, and the first granules of calcium carbonate appear.

The resulting space between covering lamella and filament wall contains a granular material. This is the only species for which lateral adhesion has been studied and reported at the ultrastructural level. The process is probably similar in most other species, but interesting variations may occur. In some species, particularly macrophysa (Sections III, IV), the peripheral utricles are free in mature segments. What happens in the developing segment has not been investigated. In other species where peripheral utricles barely touch each other {gracilis, Section IV) the covering lamella would provide the matrix to hold the utricles together and also provide the continuous outer covering of the segment.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">'V V tt£i.

Two species of calcium carbonate are deposited, aragonite and. calcite, and the type is constant for the species.

In its simplest form the reaction of calcification is the following : Ca2+ + 2HC03-, CaCOgj + HaO-fCOa That more than a physical precipitation from a supersaturated solution is involved for many organisms is shown by the isotopic composition of the algal carbonate. That of Halimeda is enriched in^^C and poor in 1^0 as compared to natural limestone <ref type="figure">(Fig. 57)</ref>, and the organic matter of this alga is enriched in^^C <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">(Milliman, 1974)</ref>. These differences indicate metabolic involvement of the plant in calcification.</p><p>1. Aragonite deposition: a process working outside filament walls Askenasy (1888) in an early microscopical study of the calcium carbonate deposits in Halimeda observed that deposits were present soon after the segment was completed, that they increased with age, and that deposition began on the outer surface of the lateral walls of the peripheral utricles and soon spread over the entire space between them.</p><p>Few further studies were made of the calcification of any alga until the 1960s <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Lewin, 1962)</ref>, by which time new techniques and equipment, particularly radiocarbon isotopes and the electron microscope, had become available.</p><p>These new tools, however, had already been applied, in the years before Lewin's review of the subject, to studies of animal calcification, and research by two workers into calcification included algae as well.

This work by <ref type="bibr">Wilbur and his coworkers (1969)</ref> demonstrated that the process of calcification in Halimeda occurs in the spaces of the segments, and they pointed out that since the peripheral utricles usually adhere laterally, the solution fillmg these spaces is not in free communication with the surrounding seawater except in the very youngest segments. They considered that a completely enclosed volume within the segment would favour crystallization, but that crystallization might also occur without complete isolation from the seawater outside.</p><p>2.

The dynamics of the system include the uptake of calcium from the seawater and its release into the seawater. Some calcium is deposited and remobilized in the skeleton, with most if not all of the calcium that is returned to the seawater originating from the carbonate deposits. The water-soluble polysaccharides of the wall mcorporate calcium 7-14 times more rapidly than the calcium carbonate deposits.

Part of the work included calculations of the effects on pH and on the concentration of carbonate ions in a closed seawater system such as the spaces of a Halimeda segment, when carbon dioxide and bicarbonate ions are removed by photosynthesis, and calcium carbonate precipitation occurs.</p><p>From their work and the results of others, they concluded that calcification in Halimeda is primarily a function of the anatomy of the alga and the uptake of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, and that the calcium-binding polysaccharide of the wall plays little or no role in the process.</p><p>Since the spaces of the segment are enclosed, entry of ions into them must be by movement through the confluent walls of the peripheral utricles or through the filaments. Borowitzka and Larkum considered that the pathway of carbon and calcium to the spaces was mamly by diffusion through the shared peripheral utricle walls. In the light, carbon dioxide uptake for photosynthesis from the seawater of the spaces, which is supersaturated with calcium carbonate, results, according to their calculations, in an increase of pH and in the conrentration of carbonate ions within the spaces, thereby stimulating the cate of aragonite precipitation. When respiration only takes place, the released carbon dioxide lowers the pH and concentration of carbonate ions in the spaces, inhibiting calcification.</p><p>Before light stimulation of calcification can occur the photosynthetic rate must exceed a certain threshold value <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Borowitzka and Larkum, 1976b)</ref>, and the rate of carbon dioxide removal by photosynthesis from the spaces must exceed, by a certain factor, the supply entering the spaces. A model of this scheme is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 60</ref>.</p></div>

In the genus Halimeda aragonite is deposited, and the crystals are predominantly needle-shaped. Carbonate deposition seems to be an important function in the metabolism of Halimeda.</p><p>The deposition of aragonite in Halimeda occurs within the segment but outside the filaments that comprise it, that is, it takes place within the closed or essentially closed spaces of the Halimeda plant.</p><p>The first crystals form in the spaces between the peripheral utricles, at the filament wall surface (interutricular and not intercellular space), when the segments are about one to two days old. A distinct organic matrix has not been observed, and crystal orientation is random. The deposits increase rapidly with age until most of the space within a segment is filled. Secondary crystal formation occurs, the aragonite needles acting as nuclei.</p><p>The spaces within the segments are essentially closed since the peripheral utricles of most species adhere laterally at their outer edges.</p><p>The seawater environment of the segment is not in free communication with the surrounding seawater except in the very youngest segments, and possibly the very oldest segments of some thalli. Such an environment could favour crystallization.</p><p>The mucilages of the filament walls contain a calcium-binding polysaccharide fraction. Its calcium complexing strength, however, is low, and conclusive evidence linking it with calcium carbonate deposition has not been obtained. The fibrous matting layer of the filament walls appears to be polysaccharide.</p><p>Twoand threeor more compartment systems have been proposed as representing the pathway of calcium from seawater to aragonite deposit. Other workers have concluded that calcification in Halimeda is primarily a function of the uptake of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis from the enclosed spaces of the segment. Theoretical calculations indicate a resultant increase in pH and in the concentration of carbonate ions within the spaces, which in turn stimulate the rate of aragonite precipitation.</p><p>These combined studies on calcification in Halimeda have added much in a relatively short time to our appreciation of calcification in this alga. They have also left unanswered questions which have interested more than one group of workers, such as the precise pH within the spaces of the segment at different metabolic phases and the importance of crystal nuclei in initiating aragonite deposition. We need more information on calcium within the filaments, and also some comparison between results of physiological experiments using intact growing Halimedae, Halimedae recently collected from their reef habitats, and branches removed from these coenocytic plants. Halimeda is an admirable plant to grow in culture and in which to study the control of chemistry outside a biological membrane. And m mastering the mechanism used by Halimeda to control the medium between its filaments we will learn something of how the whole organism maintains homeostasis without the benefit of cellular epithelium or, indeed, even an intact boundary layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. Reproduction</head><p>Much of the reproduction oi Halimeda may be by vegetative cloning, the details of which have now been followed in laboratory culture and are understood in outline. The complete sexual cycle, however, is still not known, with no observations of the development of a zygote uito the familiar Halimeda thallus. A sexual episode appears to be an outpouring of the energy reserves of an entire thallus into the gametes, and involves the death of the parent plant. This is a breeding strategy reminiscent of an annual weed, though here it is followed by a plant that we now know can maintain itself for an indefinite number of generations between sexual episodes by vegetative means. The breeding strategy has much in common with that described by <ref type="bibr">Wilhams (1975)</ref> as the "strawberry-coral model", though, as we shall see, the Halimeda version presents some unusual twists.</p><p>There was little information about reproduction in Halimeda when <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Fritsch (1935</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Fritsch ( , 1948</ref> wrote his treatise on the algae, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Dawson (1966)</ref> his book on marine botany. It was known, however, that plants were occasionally collected bearing tiny globules clustered on stalks along the margins of the segments or over their surfaces <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs 61, 62</ref>). The clusters looked like miniature bunches of greenish to blackish grapes, and were sometimes sparse and restricted to one or a few segments ; at other times they were dense and covered much of the thallus. The general form of these structures in a number of species had been <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 61a. Figures 61a, b and</ref>  described by several workers, some of them having only preserved or dried material to work with, and the review of reproduction for the genus <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref> indicated that plants bearing these clusters were rarely collected and were known for only nine species.</p><p>The first workers to report these tiny globules, Derbes and Solier (1856) and later <ref type="bibr" target="#b264">Schmitz (1880)</ref>, worked with fresh tuna from the Mediterranean. They noted not only the structures but the release from them of bifiagellated zooids. For some time thereafter, the contents of the globules were referred to, sometimes as zoospores, at other times as gametes, and there was little support for the choice of term other than ECOLOGY AND TAXONOMY OF Holimeda 201 <ref type="figure">Fig. 62b</ref>.

That the flagellated zooids were evidence of a sexual cycle was not finally demonstrated until fusion was observed in remarkably recent times <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">(Nasr, 1947;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Chihara, 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Kamura, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Merten, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Meinesz, 1972b)</ref>.</p><p>The demonstration of vegetative reproductive cycles in Halimeda has been even more recent. Field workers have long noticed that some sort of reproduction by creeping growth through sand must occur, but only recent culture work has shown the details and varieties of this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Colinvaux et al., 1965;</ref> 1968b; <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Hillis-Colinvaux, 1973</ref>). This work shows that individual Halimeda thalli have a definite term to their existence, and that new thalli are cloned from creeping rhizoids of the parent thallus, or from broken portions partially buried by chance. There is no difficulty in recognizing generations in Halimeda <ref type="figure">(Fig. 63)</ref>, whether these be sexual or asexual, and the life-cycle always seems to involve youth, a maturity measured in months, sometimes longer, senescence and death. <ref type="figure">Fig. 63</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Sexual processes in Halimeda</head><p>Feldmann <ref type="bibr">(1951)</ref> provided the first modern description of the contents of the small globules or gametangia borne externally on a segment. His material was the large-segmented Mediterranean tuna, and he noted that mature gametangia were of two different colours, brown and green, which occurred on different thalli. The gametes released by the two were different also. Those from the brown gametangia were slightly larger (macrogametes), and usually contamed three small chloroplasts and a posterior eyespot. Those from the green gametangia (microgametes) possessed the same number of chloroplasts but lacked an eyespot. He noted, too, that when the gametangia were first formed almost all the contents of the coenocytic filaments of the segment, especially the chloroplasts and amyloplasts, moved into the gametangia. The filaments of the segment, therefore, were essentially empty, and the thallus, as a result, appeared white. These observations show that the sexual process involves : (i) growth of gametangia on stalks or gametophores ( <ref type="figure">Fig 64)</ref> ; (ii) the transfer of the free organic matter of the thallus, includhig reserves, to the gametangia (holocarpy), a process that turns the parent thallus white ;</p><p>(iii) release of gametes of different sizes ; <ref type="bibr">(iv)</ref>  Number 1, 3 and 4 are favulosa, Nos. 5-8 are discoidea, Nos. 2, 9 and 10 are scabra and Nos. 11 and 12 are monile. <ref type="bibr">(From Hillis, 1959.)</ref> The complete development of a zygote to a new thallus has not yet been observed and may possibly involve a different life-form.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">. Development of gametangia</head><p>Hillis (1959) described gametangia for favulosa, and listed the following species as those for which gametangia were known : ? cuneata (possibly misidentified), discoidea, gracilis, iyicrassata, macroloba, monile, scabra, simulans and tuna. Subsequently^, gametangia have been described and drawn for opuntia <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Kamura, 1966)</ref> and cryptica <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Graham, 1975)</ref>, and I have observed them on copiosa, cuneata, cylindracea, lacunalis f. lata, macroloba, macrophysa, micronesica and velasquezii. Gametangia are therefore known for 60% of the species.</p><p>The stalks supporting the gametangia (gametophores) arise from the segment in three ways <ref type="bibr">(HiUis, 1959):</ref> (i) as continuations of the main medullary filaments subsequent to the nodal fusion characteristic of the species <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 64, Nos. 3, 5, 8,   10</ref>, 12);</p><p>(ii) as lateral outgrowths without fusion from medullary filaments <ref type="figure">(Fig. 64, Nos. 2, 4, 9)</ref> ; (iii) as extensions from peripheral or secondary utricles <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 64,   Nos. 1, 6, 7, 11)</ref>.</p><p>Contents of the gametophore are continuous with those of the filaments of the supporting segment, and true plugs or septa such as noted by Howe for scahra (1905a) have not subsequently been reported for this or other species <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Feldmann, 1951;</ref><ref type="bibr">HilHs, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Colinvaux et al., 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Graham, 1975)</ref>.</p><p>Significant taxonomic differences among species may occur in the dimensions of gametophores particularly the length, the extent of branching of gametophores, and in the size, shape and number of mature gametangia. In cryptica the gametangia are borne predominantly on the shaded under surface, rarely on the margins or at the nodes, and not on the upper surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Graham, 1975)</ref>. Non-reproductive characteristics, however, are more consistently available, and therefore are considerably more useful for species identification.</p><p>In laboratory aquaria I have found that when a Halimeda becomes fertile, the thallus changes, often dramatically, from green to white overnight or during the "dark" phase of growth, and clusters of gametangia develop on the surface of the segments or along their margins, from white filaments protruding beyond the surface of the segment. At first the developing gametangial structures are white, but they soon become pale green, then darken further as they mature ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 61</ref> ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Hillis-Colinvaux, 1973</ref>).</p><p>Electron micrographs of young, pale green gametangia show numerous plastids with sizeable starch grains <ref type="figure">(Fig. 65)</ref>, at least in the vicinity of the wall which has the familiar matting of fine fibrils over its outer boundary.

In my cultures gametes are usually released about 36 hours after the white gametangial stalks appear, leaving behind a white, disintegrating thallus which would be unlikely to be taken by collectors. Fertile plants can often be found in the field by diligent examination of large populations, but this procedure only became practicable with the advent of scuba. It remains true, however, that only a small proportion of a population may be found to carry gametangia at any one time <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Beth, 1962)</ref>, and that several asexual generations may pass before gametangia are produced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Development and fusion of gametes</head><p>Gametangia in a late stage of development are either brownish or a very dark green and have the often-remarked "bunch of grapes" appearance. Electron micrographs of the dark green gametangia at an estimated 12-16 hours before the gametes would be released <ref type="figure">(Figs 66,  67)</ref> show that cleavage into microgametes is well advanced, although not yet complete. The microgametes contain a large, somewhat posteriorly oriented chloroplast, often with one or more starch grains.

Release occurs about 36 hours after the first sign of gametangial development, and usually within about an hour after Hghts go on in the controlled environment room. The number discharged by even a single thallus has frequently made the water of an 11-51 aquarium resemble thick pea soup, and observation becomes extremely difficult. Gametes are released in a series of puffs, with the units of each puff often held together by mucilaginous material <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Hillis-Colinvaux, 1973</ref>).</p><p>Merten (1971) also reported a mucilaginous substance discharged from macroloha gametangia for 15 of the 25 releases she observed. For the remaining 10 a mucilaginous casing formed around the gametangia. Discharge is not from individual pores in gametangial walls, but from one, possibly two, central siphons within the gametangial cluster <ref type="figure">(Fig.   64</ref>) which represent the undifferentiated tip of the gametophore. It is through such a structure that the gametes rush in the related genus Chlorodesmis <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Ducker, 1965)</ref>.

Thalli bearing the two kinds of gametangia were placed together in glass dishes containing Millepore-filtered seawater of field temperature and arranged in indirect sunlight. The bottoms of the dishes were covered with glass slides. Air and circulation were provided by bubbler and pump. After the gametes had discharged and fused, the glass slides were placed in Petri dishes containing von Stosch's artificial seawater prepared with filtered water. The Petri dishes were exposed to different conditions of temperature and light, but the most successful were those maintained at 20-23°C in indirect sunlight. The seawater was changed every 15 days, and the glass slides were moved to another container if other algae or bacteria developed. When, after one year the resultant growth was 0-5-1 cm tall, the glass slides were placed in a closedsystem seawater aquarium equipped with bubbler and filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(Meinesz, 1973)</ref>. fê ô o £ <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Meinesz (1972b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Meinesz ( , 1973</ref> reported that after one week of growth under these conditions, the zygotes had a diameter of 5 pim, and contained a single nucleus and four to five chloroplasts.

The coenocytic condition was established by division of the large nucleus to form nuclei of 2-3 y.m diameter. The chloroplasts lost their starch, and thereafter appeared like rice grains. Amyloplasts differentiated. A positively phototrophic filament of about 30 [j,m diameter grew out of the sphere, and a few days later a negatively phototrophic filament developed from the opposite end.</p><p>After about five additional months of cultui'e there were a number of erect and creeping filaments. The erect ones were about <ref type="bibr">90-130 {j.m</ref> in diameter and 2 cm tall, and at the tips of some were slight dichotomous or trichotomous forkings. The creeping filaments proliferated in all directions, and sometimes produced additional erect filaments as well. The diameters of the creeping filaments, which were often constricted, were variable.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subsequent development was not observed.</head><p>Meinesz' observations thus end with the production of a filamentous mat, and the stages that must be passed between this structure and an adult thallus are still unknown. We have a similar ignorance of the sexual development of many taxa in the whole order Caulerpales, not just in Halimeda. It may be that a mature thallus can grow directly from one or more of the filaments of the mat. On the other hand, new structures might develop which could be precursal to the Halimeda structures with which we are familiar. Various workers have suggested that some of the more filamentous Caulerpales, such as species of Chlorodesmis and Pseudochhrodesmis, may be part of the cycle of genera such as Halimeda <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">(Taylor et al., 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Papenfuss, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ducker, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Meinesz, 1972b</ref>).</p><p>In the laboratory, after the gametes have been released, the white thallus disintegrates, with segment after segment being shed until, within two or three weeks, little more than a heap of segments remains <ref type="figure">(Fig. 62)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Merten (1971)</ref> observed that in the field the thallus collapsed in a day or two after the gametes were released.

Vegetative reproduction of Halimeda Halimeda plants that grow in sand reproduce by "runners" of filaments <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">(Fig. 69</ref>). These filaments, or bundles of filaments, are at least 20 cm long (the limits of my aquaria) and spread laterally through the substrate from the main holdfast <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Colinvaux et al., 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr">Colinvaux, 1968a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Hillis-Colinvaux, 1972</ref>. They are non-photosynthetic, and are individually fine and threadlike. The walls of the filaments are relatively thick, and in places pigmented yellow and regularly constricted, so that the thread sometimes appears like a string of beads, particularly in the immediate vicinity of the plant. Eventually they produce a tight clump or cone-like mass of filamentous material <ref type="figure">(Fig.  70</ref>) which pushes up out of the substrate and from which the Halimeda segment is organized (Section VI). More segments are produced, sometimes at the rate of at least one a day per growing tip <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Colinvaux et al., 1965)</ref>. Eventually the physical connections between young and parent thallus are lost.</p><p>This same mechanism, the development of new thalli by independent and usually horizontal growth of rhizoidal filaments away from the holdfast, may exist for rock growers as well. Certainly holdfasts and filaments of many other algae grow across rock or penetrate it, with the <ref type="bibr">Fig. 70</ref>. Two young Halimeda plants (arrowed), not yet emergent from the substrate, developing from the larger thallus by rhizoidal runners. The white conelike masses at their tips are similar to ones that form the first segments in similar young plants.</p><p>Development may be somewhat atj^pical because rhizoidal material, by being next to aquarium wall, has been exposed to light. The diameter of the white discs is 0-85 cm. siphonaceous alga Ostreobium, which appears to grow exclusively in rock, being a notable example of the ability of some filaments to penetrate this substrate.</p><p>There are also other methods of vegetative reproduction. Prostrategrowing Halimedae, such as micronesica, opuntia and to some extent renscJiii, sometimes produce medullary filaments which remain uncorticated. These filaments grow to a length of several segments and are frequently intertwined, forming coarse, orange-coloured ropes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 46)</ref> which I have sometimes referred to as "rope-like extensions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr">Section VI)</ref>. Some thalli have a number of these extensions, produced on as many branches, which are frequently firmly fixed to rock at various points along their length. Sometimes noticeably younger thalli are attached to an older plant by these extensions, indicating that such filaments not only anchor a thallus, but initiate new ones <ref type="figure">(Fig. 46)</ref>.</p><p>Another mechanism for vegetative reproduction lies in the production of rhizoidal filaments between segments. These filaments, at least initially, provide additional anchorage, but they also permit division of the alga into separate thalli as the older, more basal segments of the branch disintegrate. This method of growth and clone development ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 71</ref>) appeared to be important in maintaining some of the large patches of macrophysa and opuntia at Enewetak.</p><p>On a few occasions I have observed how cloning might occur when a thallus is partially buried in shifting sand. Although half and sometimes more of the thalli observed were buried, and the buried portions had lost their green colour and started to disintegrate, extensive new growth occurred from the branch tips. The new segments had all the signs of vigour, possessed the muted green colour characteristic of many growing Halimedae and were unepiphytized. For these plants it seems likely that independent holdfasts would develop near the bases of the actively growing branches, perhaps as described above for macrophysa.</p><p>A number of separate thalli would result.</p><p>In addition, vigorous branches of Halimeda which have been separated from the main thallus can develop holdfast systems, thereby functioning as reproductive structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Hillis-Colinvaux, 1972</ref> Such Halimeda "fragments" might be produced in the reef by waves, storms or animals, and they might be transported in currents. Under favourable conditions they could become established and develop into complete thalli.</p><p>Vegetative reproduction seems to be the way in which many individual Halimeda plants are produced. Many of the familiar aggregations of Halimedae, whether on rocks or in patches of sand, are probably clones <ref type="figure">(Figs 63, 72</ref>). And the commonest method of cloning is by the outgrowth of rhizoidal filaments, either from holdfasts or from the tips of segments. It is a matter of note, however, that the individual plants so produced have limited lives. The ageing thallus becomes coated with epiphytes whereas the segments of a young plant growing from the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 71</ref>. Early stages in the clonal de\cl()i)iiieiit in H. inonile bj-disintegration of older thallus, and eventual development of new holdfasts near the bases of actively growing branches. In this way several vegetative thalli are produced. Two of the actively growing erect branches have whitish to pale green apical segments which are less than 48 hours old. Scale bar is 1 cm. parental filament is epii3hyte-free. Cloning in Halimeda serves as a defence against epiphytes even as it increases the numbers of the plants.</p></div>

The protosphere subsequently produced two filamentous outgrowths from which a mass of filaments developed, which were heteroplastic and coenocytic, and were of the same general form as the filaments produced by the Halimeda zygote.

The principal method appears to be cloning by sending out "runners" of filaments. Sexual reproduction is infrequent and always leads to the death of the thallus. Development of zygotes seems to require many months, at least five, although the complete process of development has not been followed for any taxon of the group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Reproductive strategy and the strawberry-coral model</head><p>Holimeda populations appear to be clones which maintain themselves by vegetative means for numbers of generations that seem to be unlimited. Yet occasionally individuals, or, more rarely, parts of individuals, devote their entire resources to a sexual episode. Although the full course of the development of the zygote is still not known, there is reason to suggest that sexual reproduction is followed by either a resting stage or dispersal. The value of both vegetative cloning and sex to plants and animals with life-cycles like this has been explained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">Williams (1975)</ref> with his strawberry-coral model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">The strawberry-coral model</head><p>For an organism living in a habitat which remains unchanged for a time which is long in terms of the generation time, <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">Williams (1975)</ref> argues that it is a better reproductive strategy to produce individuals identical to successful parents than it is to leave the next generation open to the risk of a great variety of competing genotypes. Individuals of a parental strawberry or coral clone will already have been selected during a series of competitive exclusions with neighbouring clones, and continued success requires that the winning formula be repeated. A sexual effort in such clones should only follow when the very high cost of producing many disastrously unsuitable experiments becomes less than the cost of making more copies of the parent. This cost of a sexual endeavour may well only be met when the cost of more vegetative reproduction is local extinction.</p><p>Sex, in Williams' view, should only be required when it is necessary to make individuals for competitive struggles in new and untried circumstances. Sex, therefore, should precede the making of resting stages that will survive a hostile environmental episode, since the circumstances in which the clones of the future will compete are likely to be different to those familiar to the parent clone. In a like manner, sex will also precede episodes of dispersion, since the propagules must colonize habitats which will certainly be unlike that familiar to the parent clone. Finally, sex may well be the reproductive resort of individuals in the middle of the parent clone, even when the habitat remains unperturbed. These individuals will gain no advantage in fitness by producing copies of themselves since their surroundings are already full of their own copies. For these crowded ones in the middle of the clone the best hope of fitness will be to send out colonizing propagules (made various by sex), or to flood the old clonal habitat with new experimental genotypes, one of which just might be better than the parental strain.</p><p>It is important to notice that <ref type="bibr">Williams'</ref> model is based on the postulate that fitness will be won in competition with other individuals or clones. Diversity through sex is demanded, in the first instance, not by the physical needs of new habitats but because a slight competitive advantage in new or changed habitats may go to a fresh genotype. It is on grounds of competitive advantage that sex should precede resting and dispersal, or be the resort of individuals in the middle of clones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Halimeda reproductive strategy summarized</head><p>The commonest means of reproduction appears to be by vegetative cloning. Most of this takes place by sending out "runners" of rhizoidal filaments. Sand-dwelling forms thrust the filaments through the sand so that each plant looks to be de novo and independent. Rock forms spread more obviously from epicentres. Secondary forms of vegetative reproduction are the sprouting of vegetative parts and the establishment of pieces broken off from thalli.</p><p>Sexual reproduction is sporadic and almost always involves the death of the entire thallus. The usual pattern is that a sexual episode is separated from the next by one or more vegetative generations. Sex involves the production of an extremely large number of flagellated gametes to the manufacture of which the entire resources of the parental protoplasm have been devoted. This gamete swarm is to be expected to yield a large swarm of zygotes.</p><p>The data on what happens to the zygotes are extremely scanty, but nonetheless suggestive. The zygote appears to develop very slowly, taking months for the initial growth. And the result of this growth is a filamentous mat in no way like the parental thallus. After 12 months in a laboratory container no more development is observed. The development time of a zygote, therefore, appears to be of the order of one to two vegetative generations. It is also of a length to serve as a resting stage to pass the adverse seasons of an annual cycle.</p><p>The correspondence of the Halimeda breeding strategy with the requirements of the strawberry-coral model is obvious and close. There are large populations established and maintained by cloning, and sex is an intermittent and unusual procedure. It becomes profitable to look at the life-history of Halimeda with the predictions of the model in mind. Halimedae, in most environments, conform to this prediction in the same way that the corals discussed by Williams do. The habitat is unchanging on time-scales long enough to permit competitive exclusions between clones whose reproductive cycle is of the order of a calendar year. There is, however, the possibility of devastating grazing on clones.</p><p>A number of browsing animals are known to eat Halimeda, raising the possibility that the almost pure stands produced by a clone could be systematically wiped out by a population or migration event among the herbivores. If Halimeda were to be regularly and drastically cropped, then it would be expected that competitive advantage would go to strains which are cropped least. The clonal habit would then be a disadvantage, the chances of fitness would be improved by variety, and the vegetative production of a clone should yield to sexual reproduction.</p><p>There is at least reason to argue, therefore, that the unchanging environment demanded by the strawberry-coral model may not always exist for tropical Halimedae, even when the physical habitat remains constant.</p><p>Our data are not yet good enough to resolve this question. One way of looking at it is to note that it is a prediction of the strawberry-coral model that the environment be essentially constant, and to extrapolate from this the prediction that cropping of Halimeda must be slight.</p><p>There are no data for a satisfactory test of this prediction, though there are lines of argument which suggest that the prediction may not be met. Opuntioid forms of Halimeda are grazed by urchins, and numerous taxa have been shown to eat the sand-dwelling forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">(Randall, 1964</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">(Randall, , 1967</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Mathieson et al, 1971 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Earle, 1972)</ref>. Also there is much patchiness in the distribution of Halimeda clones which might be easy to understand if the patches represented a pattern of grazing.</p><p>(b) Resting stages are produced by sexual reproduction. The scant data on zygote development are in keeping with this prediction, in that the zygotes develop very slowly. It is also true, however, that the adult thallus can persist for a very long time in an apparently moribund condition. Plants survive for at least 2 years in culture when covered with epiphytes. It may be that Halimeda has a dual system of providing resting stages, j ust as auxospores of diatoms may be sexually or asexually produced.</p><p>(c) Dispersal stages are expected to be produced by sexual reproduction.</p><p>The evidence for how Halimeda disperses is extremely slender and, indeed, essentially no more than speculation. It is possible that the limited amount of transoceanic dispersal accomplished by members of the genus (Section VIII) may be accounted for entirely by the chance drifting of bits of broken thalli, and so do not require a sexual event. On the other hand, the zygotes are made after fusion of motile gametes and may result in producing something that would pass as part of the phytoplankton. It could also be that the filamentous mat which Meinesz (1972b) describes can float in the plankton and thus travel for months before settling. But there are no data. It would be worthwhile to test this prediction of the strawberry-coral model : that there may be in the tropical plankton zygotes or filamentous mats of Halimeda.</p><p>(d) Sexual episodes will be triggered by environmental cues for changing conditions or will occur in groups of individuals at the centres of clones.</p><p>There are no convincing data that the production of gametangia is ever synchronous across a Halimeda clone or population. There have been some suggestions that chemical cues may be needed to bring on a sexual episode, a postulate which involves the prior postulate that sexual reproduction be synchronous. Rios in Jamaica. The collections were planted in 44 aquaria, at densities of a dozen per tank on 2 July, 1969. In 11 tanks a single thallus became fertile and released gametes between 12 August and 6 November. In none of these 1 1 tanks did another plant become fertile, although all were bathed in an opaque green cloud of gametes for a number of hours. In five tanks more than one thallus developed gametangia and gametes, but individual plants waited up to a month after their neighbour's sexual episode before they too developed gametangia. These data suggest rather strongly that Halimeda thalli do not take sexual cues from one another. In addition, in 20 years of field work in three oceans, I have never seen any incidence of gametangia that would suggest that a synchronous reproductive effort was being made. This observation appears to be in keeping with the observations of other workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Beth, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Merten, 1971)</ref>, and it is probably a safe, if tentative, conclusion that Halimeda populations do not produce gametangia synchronously.</p><p>It may be that Halimedae represent an extreme version of the strawberry-coral model which is an adaptation to some of the world's most constant physical environments. What changes there may be in the local physical circumstances of life in the tropical range of its growth are too small to be worth the expense of sexual reproduction, involving, as it does, the destruction of an entire thallus. Asexual cloning therefore, spans the seasons and persists from year to year. The only circumstance then left by the model, when sex will pay, is that of individuals in the centres of clones, for whom making carbon-copies of themselves is pointless. The sporadic sexuality oi Halimeda may, in fact, represent the incidence with which individuals are surrounded by their own clonal descendants and thus forced into sex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. BlOGEOGRAPHY AND PhYLOGENY</head><p>When identifying specimens of Halimeda, geographic distribution is often a helpful character with which to supplement morphological criteria. In spite of being an ancient pantropical genus, therefore, the evolutionary history of Halimeda is still recorded in its geography. There seem to be few species of very wide range but rather patterns of local parallel evolution. However constant is the distribution of warm equatorial waters the Halimedae of different parts of it are effectively isolated. They cross ocean gaps but poorly, as would be expected from our knowledge of their dispersal systems <ref type="bibr">(Section VII)</ref>. We may approach the study of biogeography and phylogeny of this genus, therefore, with the expectation that there is preserved the print of ancient episodes of dispersion, perhaps even those resulting from very slow processes like the movements of ocean plates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Present distribution</head><p>Representatives of the genus Halimeda grow wherever there are warm seas, sufficient light and appropriate substrate. The band of sea known as tropical, and delimited by lines of latitude 23-5°n orth and south of the equator, therefore provides a rough model of its worldwide distribution. Warm waters, however, are only approximately delimited by a fixed number of degrees of latitude, since their extent is determined by ocean currents, which in turn are aff"ected by the rotation and orbiting of the earth and the topography of intervening land masses. The tropical band of sea is asymmetric. It is broad on the western side of the oceans, thin on the eastern side, a pattern which is most marked for the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The shores of island groups such as Bermuda and southern Japan, as a result, are bathed by warm waters, although geographically they are north of the Tropic of Cancer. Both aff'ord habitats for Halimeda. But Peru, located within the tropics, has cold waters along its coast and is without Halimeda. The precise latitudinal extent of tropical water shifts seasonally, generally moving to the north in the middle months of the calendar year, to the south at the end and beginning of the year. Halimedae at the northern and southern limits of the generic range, therefoi'e, are exposed to a seasonally fluctuating environment. The usual temperature of the tropical water is in the neighbourhood of 25°C.</p><p>All the species of Halimeda are restricted to this asymmetric tropical band except tuna and cuneata <ref type="figure">(Fig. 75)</ref>, and their distribution within this band is summarized in Table XIX. Halimeda tuna, both the typical and large-segmented forms, also grows in the Mediterranean where it is the only Halimeda species. Halimeda cuneata, alone among the species, occurs in a band of cooler water, to about 20°C, which corresponds to the subtropical zone. This particular taxon appears to be absent from the tropical region where the other Halimeda species occur, although our knowledge of its precise distribution is confused because other species, particularly discoidea, have commonly been identified as cuneata <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref>. Initially it appeared to be restricted to the southern subtropics, where it is known from the tip and western shores of South Africa, southern Madasgascar, south-west Australia and south-east Australia <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 75; Hillis, 1959)</ref>, but during the International Indian Ocean Expedition it was collected in the northern hemisphere near Okah, at the mouth of the Gulf of Cutch on the north-western</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">&gt; 03 ,_ iw cS o *</formula><p>coast of India (Section IV). It is commonly reported from Japan, but the material I have seen has been discoidea. Changes since the earlier revision of the genus <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Hillis, 1959)</ref> include the addition of new species and the extension of known distributions, both of which are likely to occur in the future as well. It is particularly likely that some of the species now known only for the Pacific may be found in the Indian Ocean, where even less collecting has been done than in other oceans. It would also be interesting to know if species restricted to the Indian Ocean exist. Further collecting will also be needed to determine the true extent of endemism within the genus, for it seems likely that the known ranges of some very "local" species like cryptica, favulosa, gigas, goreauii, lacrimosa, melanesica, scahra and velasquezii will be extended. <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">Table XIX</ref> also shows that of the four regions with more than ten Halimeda species, the greatest number is found in the Pacific, the least in the Atlantic. This pattern is exhibited by other tropical organisms, and may be a function both of area and of palaeohistory. <ref type="table">This table also</ref> indicates that more species occur in the western portions of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. One might be tempted to conclude that the Marshall Islands, Jamaica and the Bahamas, with their peak numbers of Halimeda species for the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans respectively, represent centres of speciation or, alternatively, that larger areas or islands support more species of Halimeda. These conclusions, however, are premature, for these and other high numbers mostly represent regions of relatively intense collection and study. As many or possibly more species of Halimeda may eventually be known for other sites when their floras are adequately sampled and studied. The species list from Honduras, for example, has increased from six to nine as a result of relatively recent scuba collections. In reality, it may be longer, and some increase in numbers of species for neighbouring Central American countries is also likely, although the eventual total from these areas may never be as high. In the south-western Pacific, New Caledonia and other island groups probably have a more diverse Halimeda flora than is now recorded.</p><p>2. Halimeda and coral distributions compared in outline <ref type="bibr" target="#b302">Wells (1969)</ref> suggests that only two reef coral provinces are clearly recognizable, the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic, and that subprovinces can be identified only "with misgivings". The preliminary data for Halimeda <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">(Table XIX)</ref> suggest greater local differentiation than this,though the same major separation between Atlantic and Pacific is evident. It may be that when the Halimeda and other algal populations of reefs have been studied with the taxonomic intensity of the corals, their separation into provinces will be no more precise. Yet other explanations for the more local distributions are possible.</p><p>It seems likely that corals disperse much better than do Halimedae, since a dispersal phase is a normal part of the life-cycle of coral species whereas in most Halimeda reproduction is vegetative. Halimeda populations of a remote shoreline, therefore, are more insular than coral populations and likely to exhibit more local endemism. It may also be that plant habitats are less restricted than those of reef corals, because</p><p>Halimeda grows not only on reefs, but also in sand, on dead reefs and at depths well below the lower limits for reef-building corals. There may thus be more opportunities for local speciation for Halimeda, perhaps particularly in sites which might not be reached so easily by propagules transported across oceans.</p><p>When the distribution of Halimeda species is better known it will be an interesting exercise to compare species distributions between corals and Halimeda species in some detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Halimeda distributions in species -poor areas</head><p>Since relatively few areas have been extensively worked for Halimeda, we cannot, at present, realistically ask some of the more interesting questions pertaining to the geographical distribution of the genus. Within this framework of caution some additional comments, nonetheless, are possible. A few areas with a low number of Halimeda species such as the Hawaiian Islands (four), Costa Rica (one), Easter Island (one), Galapagos Islands (none), Bermudan Islands (four), Mediterranean region (one) and the Red Sea (three to five) have been rather carefully worked, at least in the shallower parts of their reefs. It therefore seems to be established that these sites do indeed support very few Halimeda species. And there can be very little doubt that the Galapagos Islands are without Halimeda, even though the related siphonaceous genus Caulerpa is present. It is necessary to ask why the Halimeda flora of these places is so poor.</p><p>These sites combine two characteristics that might be expected to restrict the opportunities for Halimeda : the sites are remote, insular or isolated; the sites have either patchy or variable environments which may frequently be outside the physical tolerance of the genus.</p><p>The remoteness of the sites should be expected to restrict the rate of immigration or recruitment. This must work particularly strongly for an organism which seems to have very poor powers of dispersal. The variable environments might be expected not only to restrict the rate of establishment, but to increase the rate of local extinction. The paucity of Halimedae in these places, therefore, may be explained in the classic manner of <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">MacArthur and Wilson (1967)</ref>: we have equilibrium numbers of species set low by a high extinction rate and a low recruitment rate.</p><p>What we know of the reproductive strategy of Halimedae (Section VII) suggests that dispersal must indeed be slow. To reach a site as remote as Easter Island or the Galapagos with a piece of broken thallus drifting the seas seems an unlikely process, and we have no reason to believe that zygotes could survive such a voyage. And establishment of propagules of these kinds is probably very unlikely. The evidence of our cultures supports this. Other Halimeda relatives such as Batophora and Acetahularia frequently appear in culture tanks, even though pains have been taken to clean sand, water and cultivars. But no Halimeda has appeared which cannot be shown to be a vegetative outgrowth of another plant. The Halimeda reliance on vegetative cloning is an excellent tactic for spreading from a place of establishment, but it is not accompanied by an effective mechanism for making the first invasion.</p><p>It may be that the variable environments of these sites with few species operate more as further obstacles to immigration than as agents of extinction. All the sites have something unusual about their oceanic regimen : the periodic extremes of El Nirio at the Galapagos <ref type="bibr" target="#b309">(Wyrtki, 1973)</ref>; the winter in Bermuda and the Mediterranean. These events must narrow the window of opportunities for colonizations. In short, the low numbers of Halimedae in these places may not be so much the result of a MacArthur and Wilson equilibrium as an almost infinitely prolonged early colonization stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Palaeobiogeography and prehistory</head><p>Halimeda lived and contributed its segments to ancient reefs much as it does today. The known fossil Halimedae have been found in limestone facies of the Tethyan (Mediterranean and Persian Gulf) region <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Elliott, 1960)</ref>, Mexico and Texas <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Johnson, 1969)</ref>. The genus itself is first recorded from the Cretaceous <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Elliott, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Johnson, 1969)</ref>, but would date from the Middle Jurassic if the two genera, Boueina and Arabicodium, which are similar to it, are included in the genus as recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Elliott (1965)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Johnson (1969)</ref>. The epithet Halimeda has priority. These early Halimedae are smallsegmented, and are considered to have developed from hybridizations between the species groups Arabicodium and Bouenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Elliott, 1965)</ref>.</p><p>The existence of such a long historical record, uncommon among macroalgae, has the potential of providing considerable information about the evolutionary history of the taxon as well as contributing to the understanding of present-day distribution. However, the data for Halimeda are few at present.</p><p>The known distribution of fossil material as indicated above is along part of the borders of the Tethys Sea and the western North Atlantic. It also seems likely that halimediform algae grew in shallowwater sites over a wider range of these particular shores as well as extending westward into the Indo-Pacific, along the eastern "Pacific" shores of the existing land masses, and by Miocene times possibly along the northern shores of Australia. Examination of new sites may prove that this is so. The faunas for the Caribbean and Mediterranean regions of the time appear to have much in common <ref type="bibr" target="#b293">(Valentine, 1973</ref>; <ref type="bibr">Berggren and Hollister, 1974a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Hallam, 1975)</ref>, which is possibly the outcome of a current system common to much of the palaeoequatorial region, and to the low variability of climate. Perhaps the Halimeda fiora also was fairly similar for much of the region.  <ref type="bibr">Morellet, 1922, 1941;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Elliott, 1960)</ref>. One species of Boueina also occurred. There was, therefore, considerably more species diversity of Halimeda in this region than is shown by the taxon today for the Mediterranean, where only two forms of H. tuna are known.</p><p>Events in the history of the area during the intervening mi Dions of years, as presently interpreted by plate tectonics and continental drift, may provide insights into the cause of this dramatic decrease in diversity. They include the closing of the eastern end, then the western end of the Tethys Sea during the first half of the Cenozoic. The effect was to isolate the Tethys from the marine biota of both east and west. These events were followed by extreme evaporation in the region, with a sea-level drop of several thousand feet in the western Tethys during the Miocene <ref type="bibr">(Berggren and Hollister, 1974a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Hsii et al., 1977)</ref>. This Messinian crisis was accompanied by massive extinction of marine life. It seems likely that the Halimeda flora did not survive, or at most existed in a relict flora to the immediate west. Following this mass extinction of the Tethyan flora, the present Halimeda of the Mediterranean must have been the result of a recolonization event, probably from the Atlantic Ocean. This would be a plausible event following the Messinian crisis because there was then a more northerly extension of warm water in the Atlantic Ocean than now <ref type="bibr">(Berggren and Hollister, 1974a, b)</ref>. This warm water allowed penetration of the new Mediterranean basin by the panoceanic species, tuna.</p><p>This reconstruction of the history of the Mediterranean Halimeda flora is of special interest because it gives us a clue to the slow pace of evolutionary events within the genus. The events of the Pliocene and Pleistocene combined have left the Mediterranean with but a single species in circumstances which suggest that the initial colonization was at the beginning of this period. If this is true, then the panoceanic species H. tuna is ancient and conservative.</p><p>It is true, of course, that the above conclusions on longevity of species drawn from the Mediterranean reconstruction are vulnerable to arguments that tuna is a recent immigrant, but with the Suez Isthmus having been closed and the cool waters now prevailing in the adjacent Atlantic this seems unlikely. It may also be that a more complicated history of speciation in the Mediterranean is hidden from us by extinctions in the Pleistocene. It would be very useful indeed to recover a fossil history of the genus from the Mediterranean covering the last five million years.</p><p>This view of the paucity of species in the Mediterranean adds an extra dimension to the discussion of places with impoverished Halimeda fioras that is given above. It is concluded there that the very low recruitment rate of Halimedae may be the principal factor in producing low diversity, so much so that it is not necessary to resort to processes of extinction required by an equihbrium model. If recruitment is not only difficult and slow, but is actually confined to brief geologic periods, when current patterns are favourable, then the slow -recruitment model is amplified. It is argued above that the Mediterranean may have collected its ancestral tuna population during a brief favourable period after the Messinian crisis. A similar argument can be applied to the flora of the Canary and Cape Verde Islands, which may been have acquired during the same limited opportunity.</p><p>Other historical events may explain the present low species diversity of Halimeda elsewhere. The eastern Pacific, for example, would have become isolated from any eastern centre of distribution after the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama during the Neogene. In addition, its biota then as now was separated from western Pacific centres of distribution by a distance which Halimeda propagules appear unable to bridge.</p><p>For the southern Atlantic, a change in the pattern of surface currents, possibly accompanied by increasing separation from the Tethyan centre of distribution and succeeded by a slow rate of speciation, could explain much of the present-day low Halimeda species diversity. Berggren and Hollister (1974a) postulated current systems which could have introduced Tethyan elements along the entire Brazilian coast as late as the early Palaeogene. Present-day current patterns isolate both northern and south-eastern coasts of Brazil from the modern centre of distribution of Halimeda in the Atlantic which is the Caribbean. Additional collecting in the southern Atlantic may increase the species list somewhat, but the Brazilian flora has been worked extensively by Joly and his students.</p><p>These available studies of the fossil record of Halimeda seem to hold the clear inference that the genus tends towards conservative species, that dispersal is indeed slow, and that present distributions may well reflect past geological events as well as contemporary ecological processes.</p><p>C. Rates of speciation within the genus Once evolved, Halimeda relatively quickly seems to have replaced Arahicodium and Bouenia which are not known after the Cretaceous <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Elliott, 1965</ref>). Elliott suggests, too, that the genus diversified rather rapidly during its early history into a number of species, some fossil, such as H. nana <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">(Pia, 1932</ref>), H. praeopuntia <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">(Morellet and Morellet, 1922)</ref>, H. praemonilis and H. eocaenica <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">(Morellet and Morellet, 1941)</ref>, and some modern. There was also an increase in the size of segments and possibly in the size of the entire thallus. Three of the species, praeopuntia, eocaenica and praemonilis, are described by their authors as resembling the modern species opuntia, opuntia f. minor { = goreauii) and incrassata f. monilis { = monile) respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">(Morellet and Morellet, 1941)</ref>, with similarities such that Morellet and Morellet questioned the assignment of separate names to them. For the remaining taxa, H. nana and the undescribed species, the literature data are too sparse to associate them definitely with Recent species. Even so, two of the five types of nodal filament pattern delimited in Section III, those present in the Opuntia and Rhipsalis sections, and representing the sprawling and sand-binding habitats respectively, are represented in the species praeopuntia, eocaenica and praemonilis. It seems likely that one or more tunoid species (section Halimeda) also had differentiated before the Messinian crisis. If so, then three of the five types of nodal filament structure would have existed. These would correspond to the only patterns of nodal filaments present in modern species of pantropical distribution <ref type="table" target="#tab_21">(Table XIX)</ref>, plants which also represent the major habitat types of sprawling, sand-binding and rock-growing. And interestingly, only pantropical species are present in modern reef communities of the Hawaiian Islands, the American shores and nearby islands of the eastern Pacific (with the exception of Easter Island), the Mediterranean, the Canary and Cape Verde Islands and Brazil (Table XIX, bottom line), while three of the four species growing in the Bermudan Islands are pantropical also.</p><p>Halimeda has been an important sediment-producer throughout its history <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">(Wray, 1977)</ref>, which implies that overall conditions for its growth have been favom-able, and that there have been substantial populations during much of this time regardless of alterations in oceans and currents. Some of these changes would have led to extinction, others to isolation sometimes followed by speciation. With the development of various barriers such as the Isthmus of Panama, or the land mass at the eastern end of Tethys, separate Indo-Pacific, western Pacific and Atlantic groups would have been created out of the pantropical stock. Subsequent speciation within them would lead to the development of taxa unique to these particular regions. <ref type="figure">Figure 76</ref> illustrates possible lineages among Recent Halimeda species, and the directions in which development from pantropical stock may have occurred in different ocean regions as suggested by known distribution and similarities of habit and morphology. Some pantropical species, particularly tuna and incrassata, occur infrequently in many of the collections from the Pacific Ocean, and it is possible that satellite species such as lacunalis, macrophysa, macroloha or borneensis may be successfully replacing them. An alternative explanation is that their low numbers may be an artifact of the collections available.</p><p>The time-scale for the first events in the history of Halimeda has been ascertained by the location of fossils in the appropriate strata, and by inference from our understanding of subsequent historical events. Some modern species, however, may have existed earlier than hitherto implied. The reason for questioning the time-scale lies in the present disjunct distribution of H. cuneata. One explanation for its modern occurrence in the southern subtropical regions, delimited by the south-eastern tip of South Africa, southern tip of Madagascar, south-western and south-eastern coasts of Au&amp;tralia, and in the northern subtropical region of the Gulf of Cutch in north-west India <ref type="figure">(Fig. 75)</ref> is that this species had evolved at least by the time the regions represented were located in the same latitude, that is, before India had joined with continental Asia. The latest that they were in close proximity was in the Late Cretaceous <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">(Smith and Briden, 1977)</ref>. li cuneata existed then, it seems likely that other modern pantropical species had also evolved, and therefore would have coexisted with the fossil species which, as already indicated, have been described for a later epoch. An alternative explanation is that cuneata formerly occurred along much of the east coast of Africa and the western shores of India, that it eventually extended into subtropical waters and was displaced, or essentially so, from tropical regions. This line of reasoning does not require such an early differentiation of the taxon. Information from fossils may provide the decisive support for one of these hypotheses.</p><p>In conclusion it may be said that there is much direct evidence in the fossil record for Halimeda species being both conservative and ancient. The data allow the working hypothesis that many of the present panoceanic stocks can be identified as early as the beginning of the Tertiary. Local speciation has occurred only where isolation has been very prolonged. The possibility that diversity is a function of very poor and spasmodic opportunities for recruitment, rather than due to the establishment of species equilibria, is encouraged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. A biogeographical approach to the phylogeny of the Caulerpales</head><p>Morphological characteristics have provided most of the information for placing Halimeda in phylogenetic schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Gepp and Gepp, 1911;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Gilmartin, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Parker, 1970)</ref>, but again biogeographical data can contribute useful support or indicate weaknesses.</p><p>The Gepps (1911) suggested a common calcified ancestor for the calcareous genera, and devised a separate evolutionary scheme for the non-calcareous members of the group (Section III). This could be part of the scheme proposed below as well, with Udotea, Halimeda, Arabicodium, Boueina and the other calcareous genera developing from such an ancestor. However, even the limited data we have do not support the rigorous development of calcified and uncalcified taxa from calcified and uncalcified stock respectively. Calcified groups within the marine algae have arisen independently, Padina in the Phaeophyta for  <ref type="figure">Fig. 77</ref>. Phylogenetic scheme for the Codiaceae proposed by <ref type="bibr">Gihnartin (1966)</ref>. The genera Udotea and Avrainvillea were considered to be in the Udoteaceae following <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Nizamuddin (1963)</ref>, and hence were not included in the scheine.</p><p>example, and calcified and uncalcified phases alternate in the lifecycle of Pedobesia (MacRaild and <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Womersley, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr">Section III)</ref>, and possibly even in Halimeda. Whether or not the juvenile filaments of Halimeda (Section VII) are calcified is not indicated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Meinesz (1972b)</ref>.</p><p>A more elaborate scheme is presented by <ref type="bibr">Gilmartin (1966) (Fig. 77)</ref>.</p><p>He considered Tydemania, with its uniaxial construction, to be a primitive member of the Codiaceae and a connecting Hnk between Rhipocephalus, Halimeda and Penicillus. Recent data have indicated some weaknesses in this scheme, however. It is not supported by wall chemistry, the wall oi Codium, containing mannan while tha,t of Halimeda contains xylan <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">(Parker, 1970)</ref>. However, in spite of the helpful study of Parker, the data on wall chemistry within the group are scant, and the character may prove not to be a valid one for phylogenetic purposes. The scheme is also not supported by plastid structure, with both homoplasty and heteroplasty, and their associated differences, occurring in a single evolutionary line {Codium and Halimeda respectively) ; nor is it vindicated on ecological grounds. Gilmartin suggested that Tydemania, as a putative primitive Codiacean, may have survived in abundance only in deep-water habitats. Although it grows well in this environment, it also occurs in sizeable populations at some sites of 3-5 m depth in Enewetak Lagoon, the same lagoon in which Gilmartin worked <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Hillis-Colinvaux, 1977)</ref>, and I have observed well-developed stands of it in water of -1 m to -4m in the Indian Ocean near the small islands of Banyak, Batu, Siburu and Stupai off the west coast of Sumatra.</p><p>The distributional data for the genera of the Caulerpales <ref type="table">(Table XX)</ref> provide the basis for a new scheme <ref type="figure">(Fig. 78)</ref>. It is suggested that the five pantropical genera Halimeda, Udotea, Avrainvillea, Caulerpa and Pseudocodium are the oldest, and had differentiated before free eastwest exchange of tropical marine biota was brought to an end by the closing of the Tethys Sea. The other genera may have coexisted with them and subsequently have become extinct over part of the range, or they may have evolved later. Considering the present distribution of these genera, at least as known, the latter seems the more likely interpretation for the taxa of all but the last column which are not included in the scheme because the distributional patterns shown for them are interpreted as reflecting incomplete data. One or more of the genera in &lt; &lt; , ,</p><p>this column eventually may be shown to be pantropical. If the remaining taxa evolved later, then the calcareous genera Tydemania, Penicillus and Ehipocephalus, which are the ones of interest herein, would be more recent than Halimeda and Udotea. More detailed lineages have not been shown but Tydemania and Penicillus appear more closely related to Halimeda than to Udotea. Caulerpa, as the only genus of the Caulerpaceae, has not been included in the scheme which consequently is restricted to the Udoteaceae.</p><p>The uniaxial construction of Tydemania has an interesting parallel with that of H. cryptica, a species known only from -25 m and deeper in the eastern Atlantic. It seems likely, however, that this morphological feature evolved independently in the two taxa, and is an adaptation of these two algae to a particular niche, rather than a primitive characteristic, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Gilmartin (1966)</ref>. This niche may well involve successful growth under conditions of low light intensity and low energy reserves, leading to economy of form. In addition to the reduced numbers of medullary filaments that both taxa possess, the economy would extend, in H. cryptica, to the secondary utricles which are less fully developed on the shaded surface. So far a similar Halimeda species has not been found outside the Caribbean and the niche may be occupied by Tydemania or other taxa elsewhere, or perhaps, as with other Halimeda species, appropriate regions have not yet been explored adequately.</p><p>These phylogenetic schemes, both past and present, remain largely speculative. Some advances in understanding the relationships of the genera have been made, however, and there is an increased appreciation of avenues in which subsequent research would be particularly profitable. The long geological record of Halimeda and the widespread recent distribution of this genus indicate some of the impact the genus may have had, and is continuing to have, on tropical reefs. This contribution will be examined in more detail in the final sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. Productivity</head><p>All Halimedae are plants of shallow coasts or of coral atolls and as such they are members of some of the very few highly productive communities of the oceans <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">(Ryther, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr">Koblentz-Mishke et ah, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Colinvaux, P.

The record of thenown high productivity is preserved in many a coral reef, as in those at Funafuti where a significant part of the reef structure was found to be made of Halimeda segments (Section II). Understanding the productive capabilities of Halimedae, therefore, is necessary both for studies of energy flux through tropical reef communities, and for studies of the building of reefs themselves.</p><p>The productivity of atolls, on which so many Halimedae grow, is a particularly interesting subject since atolls are typically set in the unproductive blue waters of the main ocean deserts. Atolls are without the nutrients supplied by run-off from the land to coastal sites, nor are they typically supplied with the nutrients of upwellings. This has made their high productivity difficult to explain, and even now it is not understood in detail, though the outlines are becoming clear.</p><p>That the atoll marine system is not dependent on the nitrogen, phosphorus and zooplankton transported into it from the impoverished surrounding waters was demonstrated first by <ref type="bibr">Austin (1949, 1954)</ref> for Rongelap Atoll in the northern Marshall Islands.</p><p>They established that this atoll was inwardly sustaining, using the technique of flow-respirometry, a method subsequently employed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Odum and Odum (1955)</ref> for their work on Enewetak Atoll which is also in the Marshall Islands. This atoll too they found to be selfsupporting, and their figure for the gross productivity of a coral reef community, together with a subsequent one obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">Kohn and Helfrich (1957)</ref>, is a useful base-line calculation of the productivity of tropical reefs since the technique measures community productivity for the transect of measurement. These studies do not tell us, however, how this high productivity is achieved, or the contribution of individual reef components, like the populations of large algae.</p><p>Answers to both these questions are essential to an understanding of productivity of the whole reef and energy flow in the reef system, as well as to reef modelling. Some appreciation of the first question, how the high productivity is achieved, is provided by the realization that nitrogen and possibly phosphorus are recycled within the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Johannes et al., 1972)</ref>, the presence of some such pattern being expressed earlier in the review of coral reefs by Yonge <ref type="bibr">(1963)</ref>. The 1972 report is part of the recent work of the SYMBIOS team that studied essentially the same part of the Enewetak reef as did the Odums, as well as a more northerly transect. Some details of the results of this team effort are still being published, but what is available adds strongly to the evidence that atolls may be nearly closed systems. They fix their own energy and cycle their own nutrients, are fertile islands in an infertile sea. In this respect coral atolls have to the ecologist something of the impact of lowland tropical rain forest, because this too supports itself on nutrient-poor substrate through very efficient nutrient retrieval systems. Eor the rain forests we have a faMy clear idea how nutrient retrieval and cycling work, but we know much less about the parallel systems in a coral atoll. It seems not unreasonable to expect that nutrient retrieval and cycling is sponsored by the primary producers, suggesting that the productivity of the various plant components of the reef ecosystem is a necessary subject for research. <ref type="figure">Figures 79 and 80</ref> are photographs of the section of the Enewetak reef studied by the Odums and the SYMBIOS group. This section was <ref type="bibr">Fig. 79</ref>. The inter-island study site of <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Odum and Odum (1955)</ref> is 0-4 km north <ref type="bibr">(right)</ref> of this islet, Japtan, on Enewetak Atoll, and north of the ship hulk, a relict of the Second World War. The Odum ti-ansect extended from the algal ridge, where the waves are breaking, towards the lagoon for approximately 300 m. The reef in this region is approximately 455 m wide. (Data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Odum and Odum, 1955.)</ref> chosen for its suitability to the flow-respiratory method of productivity measurement and does not include all parts of the atoll system. In particular, it does not include most of the macrophytes. Plants included in the transect were principally the algae of mats together with the symbiotic and boring algae associated with the corals, as well as some encrusting algae. In a careful search of much of this section of reef in 1975 I was unable to find a single Halimeda plant. This observation is perhaps brought into perspective by noting that borings from Enewetak show that Halimeda segments are a principal ingredient of the Enewetak reef matrix, just as they are at Funafuti <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Couch et al., 1975</ref>). <ref type="bibr">Fig. 80</ref>. Two of six zones of the Japtan transect described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Odum and Odum (1955)</ref> in their inter-island transect: the encrusting zone (top), and zone of smaller coral heads (bottom). Halimedae were not found in either zone during our December 1975 visit. Breaking waves show at the top of these underwater pictures. Depth is c. 1'5 m.</p><p>The Halimedae of an atoll live in the deep water of the outer slopes, in the shallows of the lagoonal coasts of the islets, in the reef passages, on pinnacles and on the lagoon floor. It is at these sites that much of the productivity of the reef system, both of carbon and of carbonate, must occur, and at these sites we have very few measurements indeed.</p><p>Halimedae and other large algae occupy rather similar sites in fringing and barrier reefs, and there again the measurements are few.</p><p>Apart from work on coralline red algae like those of the reef front <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Marsh, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Littler, 1973</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b274">Smith and Marsh, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Connor and Adey, 1977)</ref>, our measurements of the productivity of macrophytes of reefs seem to be confined to a few on sea grasses <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">(Odum, 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b303">Westlake, 1963</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Qasim and Bhattathiri, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b234">Patriquin, 1973</ref>, and a few on Holimeda and other Caulerpales <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Gessner and Hammer, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Drew, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Drew and Larkum, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Johnston and Cook, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Johnston, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Hillis-Colinvaux, 1974</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Production of organic carbon</head><p>Primary productivity in aquatic communities is measured by a number of methods of which two of the principal ones are the light : dark bottle technique and the in situ^^C uptake method <ref type="bibr">(Steemann Nielsen, 1952;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b282">Strickland, 1960</ref><ref type="bibr">Strickland, , 1966</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b283">Strickland and Parsons, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr">National Research Council, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vollenweider, 1969)</ref>. Their use has led to numerous papers on primary productivity, and the topic may appear at times to be well worked. For macrophytes, however, this is deceptive. These two techniques were developed for phytoplankton, and are hard to apply directly to macrophytes, although <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Drew and Larkum (1968)</ref> chose^*C methodology for Udotea in the field, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Borowitzka and Larkum (1977)</ref> used it in a laboratory measure of photosynthesis with detached branches of Halimeda. The coenocytic nature of the algae involved could present special problems which are not discussed in these papers. The technique of flow-respirometry, which is also used, as mentioned earlier, generally provides a measure of community rather than population productivity, and is restricted to regions where there is significant water flow in one direction for a meaningful length of time.</p><p>It is of limited use for most macrophytes except for calcareous Rhodophyta of the reef algal ridge.</p><p>A few attempts have been made to apply gas exchange techniques to individual plants, or to bits of reef or sand surface, by enclosing these in plastic bags, jars or acrylic hemispheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">(Sargent and Austin, 1954</ref>; Odum <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">and Odum, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Odum, 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b301">Wells, 1977)</ref>, the most elaborate being that of Wells. But none of these attempts have been directed to Halimeda or, indeed, to other large tropical macrophytes.</p><p>They have measured gas exchange in encrusting or micro -communities of sand only. Johnston (1969) cut fresh discs from the non-calcareous siphonaceous alga Caulerpa in the field and measured the productivity of these discs by the standard light and dark bottle technique. Both <ref type="bibr">Fig. 81</ref>. Apparatus for measuring productivity of macrophytes growing in laboratory aquaria, by monitoring changes in oxygen production occurring within the aquarium over 36 hours or more. The aquarium with established, growing, clean plants is filled with water, and sealed with a thick plexiglass lid machined to fit, which in addition is held firmly in place by an 0-ring seal and turnbuckles. The lid is designed with a number of entrance ports. A peristaltic pump, left front, mamtains a water flow of approximately 0-3 m s"^past the oxygen probe. Other equipment items of the systein are an oxygen nieter (top right) and recorder <ref type="bibr">(top left)</ref>. The aquarium in the photograph contains 40 Penicillus capitatus thalli, but production in Halimeda was measured in the same way. <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Marsh (1970)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Hillis-Colinvaux (1974)</ref> established populations in aquaria which could then be converted into closed circulating-water systems <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 81)</ref>, with exchanges in oxygen production being monitored for a number of hours. Both authors manipulated environmental parameters to measure effects on photosynthesis. Marsh for calcareous red algae, and Hillis-Colinvaux for Halimeda and other calcareous green algae. The extent of the measurements for the productivity of Halimeda and the other calcareous green macrophytes is therefore small.</p><p>1 . Productivity of Halimeda in laboratory culture <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 81</ref> illustrates the apparatus used for measuring the productivity of separate populations of Halimeda, Thalassia and Penicillus by gas exchange. Details of the method are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Hillis-Colinvaux (1974)</ref>, but essentially the procedure is to select tanks of healthylooking plants that have been maintained in the laboratory for a period of one or more months, to attach the fitted lid and apparatus to their aquarium tank, to record oxygen tensions for the cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark to which they have been accustomed, and to calibrate the oxygen probe with Winkler titrations at the beginning and end of each run. Halimedae used were all the sand-dwelling incrassata in populations of about a dozen individuals, each approximately 7 cm tall (excluding the holdfast). This population density of about 220 plants m~^is within the natural range for the species. Natural populations of 100 m~^are common, and densities of nearly 500 m'"^are found in parts of the Glory Be reef (Section X). Energy provided was white light at intensities between 320 and 600 ft-c.</p><p>Under these conditions H. incrassata produced at the following rates : net production 2-5 mg C per thallus per day, or 0-56 g C m-2 drĝ ross production 4-5 mg C per thallus per day, or 1-0 g C m~^d~^.</p><p>Several of the conditions of the laboratory measurements, however, suggest these estimates are conservative. The thalli, at 7 cm, were small, since many wild plants grow to 20 cm above the sand. This difference may, however, be somewhat offset by the fact that the lower portions of tall wild plants tend to be covered with epiphytes, or to have segments which are losing their green colour. Light intensities at noon in the shallow areas where this species attains high populations are much higher than those in our laboratory, and the plants are supplied with flowing tidal water instead of recirculating water.</p><p>Finally, it must be noted that laboratory measurements have not been applied to the Halimedae that attain the highest cover on reefs, the sprawling, rock-anchored forms like opuntia. On the Glory Be reef opuntia populations may attain a cover of 90%, more than four times the cover of sand-dwelling forms like incrassata. The highest estimate for productivity of Halimeda populations given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Hillis-Colinvaux (1974)</ref> is arrived at by extrapolating the incrassata measurements to populations growing at the density of opuntia populations. By this procedure maximum productivities of 4-lgCm"~2d~^(gross) and 2-3 g C m^^d~^(net) are attained. These estimates for opuntia populations cannot as yet be confirmed in the laboratory because of the difficulty of maintaining the rock-attached forms of Halimeda in culture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Contribution of Halimeda to carbon production in reefs</head><p>A rough estimate of the contribution of Halimeda to the carbon flux of an entire reef can be obtained by applying the above laboratory results on the productivity of individual Halimeda thalli to population data of the only reef for which we have a Halimeda census, the Glory Be reef on the north shore of Jamaica. Glory Be is the name given to a short section of the Jamaican fringing reef occupying a well-defined bay separated by headlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Hillis-Colinvaux, 1972</ref>). The reef is described in Section X.A and illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figs 89-96</ref>. Percentage cover of Halimeda, by species, was estimated for each section of the reef from the shoreline to the region of the Acropora palmata corals and the buttresses. By using the cover data ( <ref type="table">Table XXI)</ref> and assuming that all species of Halimeda produce equally well regardless of depth or microhabitat, we can compute the contributions of the Halimeda populations to the total carbon flux of the reef. <ref type="table">Table XXI</ref> gives the results of applying the laboratory productivity data to the census of Glory Be reef. The total daily net production, from the region of the shallowest-growing Halimedae to the outer channel, an area of 9840 m^, which supports 1 110 300 Halimeda plants <ref type="bibr">(calcu-</ref>lated from <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Tables XXI and XXXIII)</ref> is -1 2779 g C d-i or 1014 kg C yr yielding a range of net productivities for the reef, where estimated Halimeda cover was 10% or higher, of 0-31-2-25 g C m-2 d-i or 113-821 g C m-2 yr-i <ref type="table">(Table XXI)</ref>.</p><p>The lower figures of this range were at sites where plants other than Halimeda predominated, or where there was grazing by urchins or fish, with one of the lowest figures in dense stands of Thalassia.

Outcrops of the back-reef and the moat of the reef crest (which contained much wave-stirred sand) are also excluded.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table XXII</ref> these results are compared with data for phytoplankton productivity supplied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Ryther (1969)</ref>. The highest figure</p><p>Ryther cites, that for upwellings, is about one-third of the performance of dense stands of Halimeda in a coral reef. Even where Halimeda plants are thinly spaced in Thalassia beds their contribution to productivity is still better than that of phytoplankton of typical coastal waters. Even the average productivity of the Halimedae of the Glory Be reef is equal  <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">Smith (1978)</ref>), or about twice the space <ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Ryther (1969)</ref> assigned to regions of upwelling. Since Ryther was able to show that upwelled areas produce about half the world's fish supply (he did not specifically include coral reefs in his calculations), the primary productivity of tropical reefs, to which HaUmeda contributes significantly, is an important world resource.</p></div>

In spite of the roughness of the data in Table XXIII, if seems apparent that Halimeda may well be as productive as other primary producers in the reef. Some of the estimates for whole-reef metabolism of parts of the reef where there are few to no Halimeda, like those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Odum and Odum (1955)</ref>, appear larger than the estimate for Halimeda based on laboratory culture, but there seems good reason to believe that the Halimeda estimates are conservative. It must be of interest to obtain direct measures of the productivity of Halimedae as they grow on reefs.</p><p>It remains true that the Glory Be reef is the only reef for which we have a Halimeda census, and that on a solitary occasion. For no reef have we recurrent census descriptions of the standing crops of Halimeda at different times of the year. And there are apparently no measurements at all on the production of wild populations of Halimeda by gas exchange, cropping or incremental harvest. Until these measurements are made it will not be possible to state accurately the contribution of Halimeda to the remarkably high productivity of coral reefs. If the productivity of Halimeda in the wild is as high as these provisional data suggest, however, there must be interesting questions to be asked about </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Carbonate production</head><p>Halimeda is a producer, not only of reduced carbon, but also of loose carbonate sediment, and it has become clear that unconsolidated sediments are more important to the building of a reef than the carbonate incorporated into the reef framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">(Milliman, 1974)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">Stoddart (1969)</ref> estimates that four to five times more loose sediment is produced than is incorporated as reef framework. This loose sediment is produced by Foraminifera, by the large benthic animals of the reef system like molluscs and some echinoderms, as accretionary deposits on the blades of sea grasses, and by the green calcareous algae, the most abundant and widespread of which are Halimedae.</p><p>There seems some uncertainty in the minds of students of coral reefs over the relative importance of Halimeda segments to the total flux of loose sediments into a reef. The subject is naturally approached from the point of view that coral reefs are just what they are called, "reefs made of coral", which is to say that they are animal creations.</p><p>Furthermore, a visit to a reef reveals corals in abundance but, unless you dive and hunt, no obvious green plants. As we noted earlier, the transect at Enewetak studied by the Odums and the SYMBIOS group <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Johannes et al., 1972</ref>) contains few to no Halimedae or other large green algae. Apart from the borers and the symbionts, the main evidence of plant life is given by the encrusting red algae of the fore-reef where the waves break. But these red algae are properly regarded as part of that reef framework that contributes only a quarter of the reef mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">(Stoddart, 1969</ref>).</p><p>1 .

And this observation comes from cores taken on islets or the reef ridge, not in the lagoon where the contribution of Halimeda would be largest.</p><p>The evidence of drill cores, therefore, is that a significant part of the mass of coral atolls is made of the segments of this one green alga, Halimeda. Much of the work of maintaining the atoll habitat is done by these plant populations, and the solar energy flux they transduce not only fuels food chains but also contributes to the structure of the ecosystem in a way that may be necessary to the system's homeostasis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The shedding of segments and the segment fates</head><p>The aged, white, yellowish or greyish segments commonly are shed from the apical portions of a Halimeda thallus by a natural separation from the node, rather like a tree leaf being shed in the autumn.

The species macrophysa is a good example, opuntia somewhat less so. Most commonly, however, the segments floor some surface in the immediate vicinity, from whence they may be transported by the currents to other sites, or they may be transported directly. The pattern of movement will depend both on their weight (branches may be involved initially as well as segments) and on the strength of the currents. Their transport out of the region may be slowed by the growth of blue-green algal mats over them <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs 102, 103</ref>), or by various gelatinous materials within the sediments <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">(Moore et al., 1976</ref> At Enewetak <ref type="figure">(Fig. 83)</ref> some of the lagoonal sediments may have originated on the fore -reef, and some lagoonally derived Halimeda material may be transported through the passes in the reef to outer areas. Such movements may be somewhat seasonally controlled, since li. HILLIS-COLnsrVAUX both the amounts of Halimeda segments shed and the types of currents may have seasonal components. At the Enewetak sites I visited, the commonest species were Tnacrophysa, opuntia, cylindracea, gigas, distorta, copiosa and lacunalis f. lata. These, then, are the species, about half the total number found on the atoll reef, which would contribute most of the Halimeda sediments <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Hillis-Colinvaux, 1977)</ref>, but it is likely that two or three from this short list produce the bulk of the Enewetak sediments.

That many of them remain essentially entire or in sizeable pieces for some time is demonstrated in numerous samples of loose sediments, or in the whole segments that frequently floor the immediate vicinity of a grove of Halimedae.

The Chlorophyta are represented by 18 taxa, the Rhodophyta by 16. The overall linear relationship between the two functions is somewhat different in the two divisions of algae, as shown by the slopes of the regression lines. The curves were fitted by the least squares method. As the carbon accretion is related to tissue growth and the calcium accretion to skeletal growth, the slopes of the lines indicate that tissue growth rates in the Chlorophyta are proportional to the 0-3 power of the skeletal growth rate, whereas in the Rhodophyta the tissue growth rate is proportional to the 0-5 power of skeletogenesis. (From <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Goreau, 1963.)</ref> It is probably unwise to attempt to convert Goreau's figures into carbonate productivities per segment, thallus or unit area. The nitrogen basis of the measurements is excellent for comparing rates of uptake at the apex in vigorously growing specimens over short time intervals, but it does not follow that estimates of nitrogen in whole plants will let these data yield carbonate fluxes from senile plants. It is noted in <ref type="table" target="#tab_114">Table XXX</ref> that segments are at their heaviest at senescence. Calcium uptake may not be a linear function of segment age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Bate of segment production and the accumulation at Glory Be reef</head><p>The contribution of Halimeda populations to the carbonate mass of a reef is a function of the rate at which segments are lost, the carbonate content of the segments at loss and the destruction of carbonate between loss from the Halimeda and incorporation into the sediment. Losses of carbonate from shed segments are by such processes as destruction by detritus-feeding animals (in which event the net carbonate accumulation may not be altered) and solution. These carbonate  <ref type="table" target="#tab_114">Table XXXI</ref>. The data from our laboratory were obtained using the Hutchinson-MacLennan method <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Barnes, 1959)</ref>. Dried and cleaned young field specimens which I collected in Jamaica provided most of the material, but the fertile incrassata and the last two incrassata samples listed of "about to fall" and "fallen" segments were collected in a laboratory environment though much of the calcification occurred in the reefs of Jamaica. Although no uncalcified oneto two-day-old segments were included in the study, or any old white sub-basal and basal segments, the data show some of the range encountered within a species, as provided by segments of different ages and with different rates of metabolism. The variation among species, if the subtropical cuneata is excluded, is not as great, and might be even less if younger and older incrassata were better represented in the samples. These data show, with the possible exception of cuneata, that the carbonate content of a segment is a function of segment age, which is a reasonable conclusion. Older segments generally have more carbonate than young segments, and this is particularly true of the final death and loss of segment stages, as is shown clearly in the data for incrassata, where the segments with most carbonate were those collected after death (the very heavy basal segments are specialized structures not typical of the segment flux). In interpreting the data for cuneata two factors must be considered: that apical segments older than about 48 hours generally are as physiologically mature as most other segments on the thallus (Section VI) and hence the separation into "apical" and "midway" segments is not necessarily meaningful, and that cuneata has, in addition to the regular segments, stalk and collar segments (Section IV). The stalk region is uncalcified; the extent of the aragonite deposits in collar segments has not been critically examined.</p><p>These conclusions are in agreement with results from an earlier calcification study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">Wilbur et al. (1969)</ref>. There must be further variations in carbonate content with local circumstance and with time of year. Thalli of some species, for example, appear to be more heavily calcified in deeper water ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 88</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Bohm, 1973a)</ref>. But in spite of these caveats it seems reasonable to proceed to compute a carbonate flux using the estimate for a typical dead incrassata segment as given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_114">Table XXX</ref>. scanty. There are no field data beyond the general observation that white moribund segments are observed on wild plants, that plants do die as entire thalli and that death of the entire thallus always follows the release of gametes. None of these observations of wild plants allows estimates of either the frequency of death or the frequency at which single segments are shed. For the best approximations it is necessary to use data from our laboratory cultures. In the aquaria cultures individual plants of incrassata have lived for as long as two years, though the latter part of such a life seems to be spent covered in epiphytes, or under attack from epiphytes which have to be removed at frequent intervals. Plants in that condition have been seen in the field, but they are not usual and it is hard to believe that they can persist. On the other hand, there is no evidence for rapid turnover of populations as occurs in culture with Penicillus of which there may be four or six laboratory generations per year. For want of better data it is, perhaps, conservative and best to assume that a typical wild incrassata would live out the more vigorous part of its laboratory term of months, which allows us to assume that it contributes its total stock of segments in the white senile condition in a year.</p><p>The mean number of segments on 15 incrassata thalli sacrificed for other purposes in the laboratory was 131. These were field-grown incrassata that had been in the laboratory only a few weeks, though some were in one sense "mature" since they became fertile. However, the field collections were always of smaller plants, because these were best suited to the aquaria, and the figure of 131 segments per plant is biased towards the small side. It seems reasonable to assume that the typical incrassata thallus in the wild has 200 segments when full grown.</p><p>The flux of carbonate to reef sediments from an incrassata population, therefore, is 200 x 4 mg =0-8g per thallus per year. This and other conversion factors for computing productivities from Halim.eda census data are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table XXXII</ref>. -2-5 mg C thallus"^d~1 % cover (incrassata) = 10 thalli m~T urnover time is^3 generations yr~i area, opuntia segments are heavier (mean weight of CaCOg 7-75 mg) than incrassata segments, and goreauii segments are lighter (mean 1-38 mg). A single specimen ot goreauii in the laboratory collection had 175 segments and a single specimen of opuntia 626. An opuntia plant, however, covers more space than an incrassata plant. With these great uncertainties, it seems reasonable to base a rough estimate on converting cover data to incrassata thalli and proceeding on the assumption that each thallus contributes the computed 0-8 g CaCOg yr~i to the reef.</p><p>The estimated reef population of 1 110 300 Halimeda plants then contributes 888 kg of carbonate per year, or approximately 90 g m~ŷ r~^(area 9840 m^, <ref type="table">Table XXI</ref>). The equivalent rate of sedimentation, assuming 60% porosity as did <ref type="bibr" target="#b279">Stockman et at. (1967)</ref>, is ,4066 mm 30""^.</p><p>This was on a reef where the average Halimeda cover was 10%, although opuntia populations of shallow rocks reached local densities of 90% cover. Neumann and Land (1975) made similar calculations for the whole Bight of Abaco in the Bahamas, a shallow basin of 2750 km^. With an average density of Halimeda plants of 25 m"^they estimated the standing crop of the whole Bight of Abaco to produce 25-47 x 10** g carbonate. If we assume one crop a year, as was done above, this gives a carbonate flux of 9-26 g m"^yr~^, or one-tenth of the estimate for the Glory Be reef. The discrepancy is undoubtedly due to the different Halimeda densities. A density of Halimeda of only 25 plants m"^is low unless it is a species like macroloba. Sand-dwellers may grow at densities 20 times this, and higher densities still are represented by the sprawling thalli oi opuntia plants growing on rocks at densities of 90% cover. The figures actually used for the Bight of Abaco work are in fact several times larger than the 9-26 g m~2 yi--i calculated from the Abaco data here because it was assumed that there would be 6-12 crops oi Halimeda per year. As is argued above, there is no evidence for such rapid turnover in Halimeda. <ref type="bibr" target="#b279">Stockman et al. (1967)</ref> made a similar budget for the production of lime muds in Florida by Penicillus, concluding that Penicillus contributed between 3 g and 25 g carbonate m.~^yr^^. These results depended on very low population densities of between two and eight plants per square metre, but the passage of six generations a year. This generation time is in accord with my experience of growing Penicillus in laboratory culture, it having a shorter life-cycle than Halimeda. But it is possible for Penicillus to exist at much higher densities than were found in the Florida study, when the total Penicillus carbonate production could equal that of the Halimedae of Glory Be reef.</p><p>It is evident that calculation of the carbonate flux produced by calcareous green algae is sensitive both to population density and turnover times. Population densities vary by two orders of magnitude, with commensurate effects on calculated carbon flux. Errors in estimating turnover time ought to be reduced by the realization that Halimeda is predominantly a long-lived alga. We need field data for the typical length of life of the various species, but it seems likely that more than one to three generations a year, depending somewhat on species, will be found to be unusual. Some additional data are provided by the observations of R. Spies, P. Lamberson and myself on an experimental plot of cylindraceae in Enewatak Lagoon, in which over 70% of the original thalli were present at the end of 4 months. Granted the errors that can be introduced by population densities and length of life, the agreement of the calculations of Chave et al. (100 g carbonate m~2 yr~i) with the results from Glory Be is possibly fortuitous.</p><p>(e) Carbonate production in whole reefs: contribution of Halimeda. In the analysis of the mass of an atoll given above and in <ref type="figure">Fig. 84, it</ref> was suggested that the growth of a reef should be considered in two parts : the reef ridges and the lagoonal areas. In the former there is very active growth of the coral assemblage and encrusting algae, in the latter there is a large contribution of Halimeda and other green macrophytes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Smith and Kinsey (1976)</ref> likewise divided reef systems into two components, and further suggest that each has a characteristic modal rate of carbonate production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Smith and Kinsey (1976)</ref> give calculations of carbonate production for the Enewetak reef ridge based on measures of the changing alkalinity of the waters flowing over the reef. Their measures are thus comparable to the measures of carbon fixation by fiow-respirometry, and give a direct measure of carbonate accumulation on the section of the reef accessible to the technique. Accumulation on the reef ridge is given as 4 kg m"^yr~^. This is contrasted with estimates for lagoons and other still-water sites of 0-8 kg m~2 yr~i. Where the lagoon is of considerable size, as in many atolls and barrier reefs, this bimodal division of production rates indicates that the lagoonal environments probably contribute most to the mass of the reef, since the area of the lagoon only has to be four to five times that of the reef ridges for its total contribution to be the larger.</p><p>Production of carbonate in lagoonal and still-water areas is principally divided between coral pinnacles, Foraminifera, chemical precipitation of calcite and the calcareous green algae. It is, therefore, of interest to see what densities of Halimeda are required to yield a significant part of the carbonate production of 0-8 kg m""^y r~i found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Smith and Kinsey (1976)</ref> for the lagoon as a whole.</p><p>The incrassata production rate was calculated above to be 0-8 g per thallus per year. For the total production of a lagoon to be provided by sand-dwelling Halimedae growing on horizontal surfaces would require a population density of 1000 plants m"^. Apparently the highest densities so far recorded are 500 plants m"^in a few "clearings" among the Thalassia beds of the Glory Be reef. Dense populations in shallow water at Glorj^Be, Enewetak and elsewhere of an incrassata-cylindracea type of thallus have about 100 plants m"^. A clearly visible growth of Halimeda over the floor of a whole lagoon, therefore, would produce about one-tenth of the total estimate of Smith and Kinsey. This is by no means impossible and there are reports in the literature of lagoon floors having what seem, from a ship-board collecting station, to be dense covers of Halimeda <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Emery et al., 1954)</ref>. On two dives to the floor of the Enewetak Lagoon in 1975, however, I found that much of the visible terrain was almost devoid of Halimedae. Shallower lagoons (Enewetak is from 40 m to 70 m deep), however, may have denser stands. But there are also other factors to be taken into account.</p><p>The above calculations neglect two sources of Halimeda segments that may well constitute the major part of the total Halimeda contribution: the rock-growing opuntia-type Halimedae of the pinnacles and of the deep fore-reef. Halimeda opuntia at Glory Be attained local cover densities of 90%, which is roughly equivalent to an incrassata population of 900 plants m~^, and, since the sprawling life-form of these plants always tends to produce high cover, like the tillering patterns of grasses, local populations always tend to be dense. Some of the pinnacles at Enewetak support considerable populations of Opuntioid forms, and the total vertical faces of the pinnacles must be very large. With over 2000 pinnacles in the lagoon, if the lagoon were drained the aspect would be rather like the teeth of a rubber hair-brush. Without direct data on segment production by these rock-growing forms (not so far available because of the difficulty of maintaining them in culture) it is not possible to calculate their contribution, but there is clearly the possibility for a large component of total production to be included.</p><p>And to the pinnacle Halimedae must be added those of the deep fore-reef. In Jamaica, at depths of -61*5 m to -91 m, there are very dense populations of cryptica and lesser populations of copiosa (an Opuntioid form) which locally attain 60% cover <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">(Moore et al., 1976</ref>). It seems likely that similar growths are prevalent outside the fore-reef of atolls, though no census data are available because of the difficulties of diving operations at these sites. Some considerable part of the production of the deep fore -reef, which contributes heavily to the sediments of the island slope of Jamaica <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">(Fig. 86)</ref>, may be swept up in the vigorous onshore currents of these atolls, to be deposited later in the still waters of lagoons.</p><p>In conclusion it may be said that the bimodal production suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b273">Smith and Kinsey (1976)</ref>  Halimeda is a very significant contributor to this accumulation both from the production of sand-dwelling plants in shallow water, and from the rock-hanging forms of the pinnacles and possibly of the deep fore-reef.</p></div>

Halimeda Distribution in two Reef Systems</head><p>This chapter describes two reef systems from the point of view of Halimeda, or at least from the point of view of an investigator asking questions about reefs as the habitat of Halimeda. As with all reef studies there are constantly in the background questions of how the reefs were built, but these questions are again likely to be phrased from the point of view of Halimeda: "In what way have the Halimeda populations contributed to the structure and mass of the reef?" It is suggested that this might be a timely bias, since the great majority of studies on coral reef systems have been designed on the unspoken assumption that the essential process in reef-building is the construction of the coral framework. It has already been mentioned (Section IX) that the classic studies on reef productivity, like those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">Sargent and Austin (1954)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Odum and Odum (1955)</ref>, are of small sections of inter-island reefs in which Halimeda is entirely absent or a minor component. And yet Halimeda is one of the principal contributors to reef structure, sometimes perhaps the most important one <ref type="bibr">(Section, IX)</ref>. Two reef systems have been examined with Halimeda principally in mind. They are a section of the fringing reef on the north shore of Jamaica where a Halimeda census was made <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Hillis-Colinvaux, 1972)</ref>, and Enewetak Atoll where two Halimeda investigators have dived.</p><p>A. The Glory Be reef, Ocho Rios, Jamaica "Glory Be" is the name of a house near the village of Ocho Rios, sited roughly in the centre of the north shore of Jamaica. The patch of reef approached from the house was chosen for this study because two headlands marked off a convenient length of reef <ref type="figure">(Fig. 89)</ref>, and because the high cliff of fossil limestone gave a vantage point which greatly aided mapping of the various regions of the reef. The approximate coordinates of the reef section are 77°0' W, 18°24' N.</p><p>The reef at Ocho Rios is part of the Jamaican fringing reef which has been extensively studied and described by Goreau and members of his laboratory working from the nearby Discovery Bay <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Goreau, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Goreau and , and I first became interested in the northshore reef system when conducted overit byT.F. <ref type="bibr">Goreau in 1962</ref>. 1 made a preliminary survey of the Glory Be reef in September 1968 (when the water was somewhat disturbed from the passage of a hurricane), and carried out the main part of the census in three weeks in June 1969. The census extends out only to the beginning of the outer channel or moat zone (7 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 89</ref>), being extended beyond this down to a depth of 20 m (moat, buttress and fore-reef) only by qualitative observation, supplemented by observations at our other work site of Runaway Bay.</p><p>Qualitative descriptions of Halimeda populations down to about 70 m are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Goreau and Goreau (1973)</ref>. Seasonal assays of Halimeda populations at these greater depths are urgently needed.</p><p>A profile through the Glory Be reef is given in <ref type="figure">Fig. 90</ref>, the numbered parts of which are included on <ref type="figure">Fig. 89</ref> and in Table XXXIII. These reef zones need to be understood in the context of the reef nomenclature established by Goreau and his laboratory, the usages of which have changed slightly over the years. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table XXXIII</ref> the Goreau equivalents are given as they appear in <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Goreau and Goreau (1973)</ref>. The comparison of the Glory Be nomenclature with Goreau's reveals not only a finer classification of the near-shore zones at Glory Be, but also some added features of the Glory Be reef system not present in <ref type="bibr">Goreau's generalized</ref>  Goreau calls the inshore zone. These subdivisions each represent a very different habitat, and it is suspected that the four zones together are important to the total carbonate, carbon and Halimeda-segment flux of the reef. The combined inshore zone at Glory Be is separated from the shore side of a reefflat: Zoanthus zone (6) by a lagoon (5) as in the Goreau typical reef. During the two periods of work at the reef, waves did not break at the palmata zone, even though in Goreau's general model they do, and he regards the palmata zone and the breaker zone as one and the same. At Glory Be the waves broke at the leading edge of the reef flat ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 89)</ref>, after crossing the inundated Acropora cervicornis a,nd palmata corals or mixed zone (8) and the moat (7). For this reason we originally called the Glory Be zone (7) "the breaker zone", and it is so described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Hillis-Colinvaux (1974)</ref>.  palmata zone has a more restricted interpretation than in the 1959 description of the reefs, where it is appHed to the entire region between reef flat and buttresses, which in turn are followed by a cervicornis zone. The palmata zone, as delimited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Goreau and Goreau (1973)</ref>  The zonal boundaries in this system are distinct and can easily be identified both in the water and on the panorama <ref type="figure">(Fig. 89)</ref> made from the top of the cliff. The lengths and widths of the principal features of <ref type="figure">Fig. 89</ref> were measured by identifying salient features such as individual rocks from the top of the cliff and on copies of the panorama, then taping the distances directly with a nylon line. Twenty-four lengths measured in this way were sufficient to compute the surface area occupied by each zone. Rough estimates for the mean width of each zone can also be made from a copy of the panorama on which the measured distances are superimposed, allowing the calculation of the relative areas of each zone along a metre-wide transect from the cliff to the outer channel. These estimates <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table XXXIII)</ref>  Nearest-neighbour samples were most convenient in sandy areas where Halimeda populations were sparse and where the swell made it hard for a diver to keep station. The diver chose one plant as it drifted into view, placed one edge of a steel rule against it, and pivoted to find the other plant of the pair. Estimates of percentage cover were found to be the only practicable way of assessing densities of the sprawling plants of opuntia and goreauii. The census occupied about 30 hours of bottom time.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">model. &lt;!

A density of 500 incrassata m~^covers 50%, so 100% cover is taken as the equivalent of 1000 thalli m~2. The crudeness of this conversion for opuntia is selfevident, and it may be that the close-packed branches of a 90% cover stand of opuntia produce considerably more than would 900 incrassata plants. Without direct measures of the productivities of sprawling forms, however, there seems to be no way of making a more accurate estimate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Productivities at Glory Be</head><p>The productivity of the parts of this reef has been discussed in Section IX, and the principal data are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Tables XXI and   XXXIII</ref>, with some of the results of the census being included in the latter. Conversion factors for computing productivities from Halimeda census data were derived from the Glory Be survey and the associated laboratory work and are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table XXXII.</ref> 3, Narrative description of Glory Be reef At least ten species of Halimeda live in the reefs of the north shore of Jamaica, six of which {opuntia, goreauii, gracilis, tuna, incrassata and simulans) grow with varying success over much of the depth range of approximately -0-3 m to -60 m ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 90</ref>; Section IV), or to the start of the deep fore-reef. None is regularly exposed at low tide. Of the remaining species, monile appears to be restricted to shallow water, and discoidea is limited essentially to the fore-reef and fore-reef slope (although it grows in shallow water elsewhere in the Caribbean). The thalli of discoidea sometimes appear to be growing in sand, but on closer examination they are invariably attached to some rock outcrop concealed by a thinnish veneer of sand. The species copiosa and cryptica are restricted mostly to the fore -reef slope and upper part of the deep fore-reef, that is, to depths of approximately 25-100 m. Halimeda copiosa, however, does occur in shallower water in the Pacific (see below and Section IV). These two species are the only ones to establish sizeable populations on the deep fore-reef <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Goreau and Goreau, 1973)</ref>, with cryptica being the more abundant.</p><p>(a) Hard substrates. Proceeding seaward onto the reef from the shore, the first Halimeda species to appear, whether it be a member of the Rhipsahs, Opuntia or Halimeda sections, is determined to a large extent by the substrate available. On the Glory Be reef it is rock, and sprawling over it are large, dense patches of opuntia, sometimes just covered by most low tides, with holdfast filaments developing frequently from between segments where the thallus makes contact with the substrate. When the mapping-transect study was carried out, this species occupied much of the surface of the very shallow inshore rock (regions 2, 4 and 6; Figs 89-91, and <ref type="figure">Fig. 92</ref>) as well as the rock sides of region 2, and rock sides together with coral outcrops of region 5. The total Halimeda cover of the very shallow inshore rocks (region 2), given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table XXXIII</ref>, was the highest encountered in the parts of the reef <ref type="figure">Fig. 92</ref>. Clumps oi opuntia providing, at the site shown, about 50-60% thi-ee-dimensional cover on rocks of the inshore reef of Glory Be, in about 1 m of water. The breadth of most of the segments shown is 5-8 mm.</p><p>surveyed. Beyond the very shallowest regions goreauii sometimes accompanied opuntia, but seemed to be restricted to certain exposures on the coral rocks in shallow water. Past the reef flat (6), goreauii was more conspicuous and tended to replace opuntia in the deeper regions of the reef <ref type="figure">(Fig. 90</ref>).</p><p>(i) Regions of low Halimeda density on hard substrate. The seaward edge of the inshore reef flat (region 4) was conspicuously barren of Halimeda, appearing as a whitish border which can be seen on the panorama <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs 89, 91</ref>) running across <ref type="figure">Fig. 89</ref> from the dock at the right. Instead of supporting the heavy opuntia cover of the adjacent regions, this band of about 0-66 m width had a partial cover of grey-green algal fuzz, tiny opuntia and isolated opuntia cushions which showed signs of being grazed, with curved bites out of the segments, while the region was floored with similar segments. In addition, the few opuntia plants growing in the fringe had a conspicuously rounded cushion or cropped habit, and lacked the straggly projecting branches which result from active growth <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 51)</ref>. The coral rock itself was pitted, with numerous scattered hollows containing urchins at a daytime density of 12 m~^. The densest opuntia cover on this urchin border reached 5%, with overall cover not greater than 1%. The upper portion of the adjoining vertical wall also was relatively barren of macroalgae; lower on the wall Halimedae were present, although their distribution was patchy and sparse. A 1% cover was estimated for the coral rock sides and rock outcrops of the lagoon. Halimeda tuna appeared on some of the latter, sometimes pendant and in shaded sites.</p><p>About two-thirds of the surface of the reef flat : Zoanthus zone ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 91</ref> ; region 6) also lacked Halimeda cover, and was urchin-barren like the one described for the seaward edge of the shore reef. The remaining third had an almost-closed cover similar to that of the inshore reef. Halimeda opuntia was the most prominent siphonaceous alga, and the thalli appeared to be grazed. Here also the seaward vertical face of the reef lacked conspicuous vegetation, including calcareous green algae.</p><p>The Halimeda population was sparse throughout.</p><p>The buttress zone ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">Fig. 93; region 9)</ref>, a region of hard substrate, might also seem a likely site for non-sand-growing Halimedae, including opuntia. Our census did not extend to this region at Glory Be, but at Runaway Bay (between Glory Be and Discovery Bay) Halimeda won little space on this wall of living coral, although scattered thalli of opuntia and goreauii occurred here and there. The absence of this genus from the north-shore buttresses was noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Goreau and Goreau (1973)</ref>. On the hard surfaces provided by the fore -reef slope and deep forereef, the genus is more successful, and at depths of-61-5mto -91m on the deep fore-reef of Discovery Bay cover by Halimeda was estimated as 10%, with cryptica occupying up to 60% of the available space on parts of promontories <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">(Moore et al., 1976</ref>).</p><p>(b) Unconsolidated substrates. The Halimedae of sands and muds are principally members of the Rhipsalis section, although opuntia and gracilis, in their sprawling growth, are sometimes associated with such substrates. The greatest cover achieved by these Halimedae for the parts of the Glory Be reef surveyed was in the shallow sandy flats of regions 3 and 4. These flats, although sometimes barren of macrovegetation, generally supported large populations of sea grasses, the Halimeda species monile and incrassata, and the related calcareous green algae Penicillus (often capitatus) and Udotea flabellum. The resultant cover was essentially closed, and although the sea grass Thalassia testudinum Konig was a clear areal dominant, about 40% cover was provided by the above three genera of calcareous green algae, with the two Halimeda species accounting for about 15%. A fairly closed plant cover also existed in the sandy patches of the inshore reef flat (4), but much of it was provided by a spongy turf of about 16 cm thickness, composed of red and brown algae. Amidst this carpet grew compressed thalli of H. monile and H. incrassata, their buried basal portions white. In some places, about 300 of these Halimeda thalli occurred in a square metre of turf, compressed amidst the fleshy algae.</p><p>(i) Regions of low density of Bhipsalian Halimedae. Much of the lagoon (5) is sandy, and one might expect extensive stands oi Halimeda, the other calcareous Caulerpales, which are predominantly sand growers, and sea grasses. Such stands did occur <ref type="figure">(Fig. 94)</ref>. In these shallow sandy areas, I found Lilliputian forests of Thalassia testudinum, and the densest population of H. incrassata, 441 thallim^^, encountered on this particular reef. But the vegetation was patchy, and there were extensive barren areas along the edges of the reef rock and in the main part of the channel. Where vegetation occurred the sea grasses were usually the commonest, although the Caulerpalean genera Halimeda, Penicillus, Udotea and to a lesser extent Bhipocephalus were prominent too. These algae usually grew in parts of the channel which were some distance from the bases of reef walls, although a conspicuous exception was Udotea ad spinulosa which pushed up in tight clumps of about 40 clonal thalli under reef overhangs. The commonest Rhipsalian species in the inner channel was incrassata, but simulans mingled with it, particularly near the periphery of dense stands. Halimeda cover of the lagoon sands was about 5%.</p><p>Extensive patches of Rhipsalian Halimedae were anticipated in the wide moat (7) where the next unconsolidated substrate occurred proceeding seaward from the shore. There were, however, few obvious calcareous greens when the study was made. Seaward of the reef flat (6), with its few Acropera palmata and 31illepora colonies, was first a channel of ripple-marked sand, some of it halimedoid, with dune-like waves being continually moved by the surge. Neither plants nor urchins were obvious, but worm cones occurred at intervals of a metre or so.</p><p>The rippled area ended in a pebbled or cobbled region, also part of the moat (7). The rounded cobbles, typically 5 cm or so across but many larger, seemed to lie on Halimeda sand and occupied half the area.</p><p>Patches of coral rock occurred throughout the cobble region. This part of the moat contained a Diadema population averaging about 6 m^^, in places reaching a density of 20 m~2. So large a population indicates heavy production, but sizeable algae such as Halimeda occupied only a tiny fraction of the grazed surface. Instead, over much of the pebblecobble floor a fuzz of filamentous green algae grew, and this population seemed to be maintained by urchin grazing <ref type="figure">(Fig. 95)</ref>. About 20% of the moat also contained reasonably dense stands, about 300 m.~^, of <ref type="bibr">Fig. 94</ref>. A grove of H. incrassata with the occasional H. simulans m about 1-6 m of water in the lagoon of Glory Be. Cover by Hali?neda is about 30%, the proportion of young : mature : old Halimeda thalli in the region of which this photograph is a part was 1:2:1 in September 1968. The commonest associated alga in this photograph is Penicillus capitatus. <ref type="figure">Fig. 95</ref>. The cobble-urchin-fuzz system of the moat. The density of Diadema for the region averaged 6 in"^, in places reaching 20 m"^.</p><p>Thalassia, together with white urchins Tripneustes esculentus Leske and heart urchins Clypeaster rosaceus Linnaeus. The density of each of the two urchin taxa was estimated as 1 m~2. Among the sea grasses were occasional small thalli of incrassata, of density about 4 m~^. The Thalassia stands, alternating with the grassless, ostensibly barren areas, gave the impression of advancing and retreating, while the heart urchins and fuzz remained.</p><p>Where there are appropriate substrates, Rhipsalian species also grow in the deeper portions of the reef (Section IV ; <ref type="figure">Fig. 90</ref>) such as the upper fore-reef slope. However, these deep-water Rhipsalian populations are never dense, as they are in the shallows. This is, to some extent, remarkable, for rock-growing pendant species like copiosa a,nd cryptica do achieve very dense populations in deep water. The disturbance of suitable substrates by silting, or by slumping of reef, perhaps accounts for these smaller Rhipsalian populations at depth. <ref type="bibr">4</ref>. Summary: factors affecting Halimeda distributions at Glory Be <ref type="bibr">(a)</ref> Association with sea grasses.</p><p>One of the best places to find a dense (c. 450 m~^) population of Rhipsalian Halimedae is in the region of dense patches of Thalassia. The Thalassia stands constitute welldefined communities, the sand consolidated by a network of Thalassia rhizomes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 96)</ref>, and some of the less dense may contain very sizeable populations of Halimeda, or the dense Halimeda patches may be in adjacent areas. These especially thick Thalassia stands are restricted to shallow water between -0-5m and -3 m. Even in apparently optimum sites the distribution of the Thalassia stands is patchy, and there is evidence that the patches themselves are unstable. Most patches terminate in what could well be called a blow-out : there is an <ref type="figure">Fig. 96</ref>. Edge of a dense stand of Thalassia testudinum, partly fringed by other sea grasses such as Diplanthera wrightii. Here the calcareous alga Penicillus capitatus, with some Udotea, is prominent towards the edge of the bed, and extends into the sand of the lower left. There is a suggestion of a rotational process of colonizing sand, consolidation of the sand by sea-grass rhizomes, development of the dense Halimeda and other populations, and physical destruction of the community. abrupt edge, with barren sand adjacent, and the discontinuity between the Thalassia community and the bare sand reveals a vertical section of the sand consolidated by the Thalassia rhizomes which in places is about 10 cm high. These observations suggest very strongly that there is a rotational process of colonizing sand, consolidation of the sand by sea grass rhizomes, development of the dense Halimeda and other alga or sea grass populations, and then physical destruction of the community. The dynamics of this process are of immense importance to the total Halimeda productivity of the reef. (b) Grazing and the Opuntioid forms. Straggling growth-forms of opuntia on rocks form the densest Halimeda stands, reaching covers of about 90%, which is probably more than the equivalent of 900 Rhipsalian Halimedae per square metre. There seems to be good reason for thinking that the sites where densities like these can be attained are limited by grazers for many opuntia patches show direct signs of having been grazed, and apparently suitable sites are both barren of opuntia and are the habitat or territory of some urchins or fishes. It is possible that there are seasonal or periodic fluctuations in grazer populations, in which event total Halimeda densities may fluctuate very widely from time to time. (c) Factors restricting Halimeda on bare bottoms. Halimeda populations are low on the sandy bottom of the moat and on the fore-reef terrace. For the sandy, duned parts of the moat that lacked vegetation, the explanation may be that the sands are kept too mobile by the wave surge, and that only exceptionally well-anchored plants survive. On the barrens of the moat floor urchin grazing is a possibility, because high densities of urchins were found, and the vegetation which was there, a short soft algal fuzz, is a life-form that might result from heavy grazing.</p></div>

Its windward side is consequently subjected to steady wave attack for about 9 months of the year. Its southern reefs are protected from the trade winds, but are periodically damaged by powerful long-period swells from the southern hemisphere, whereas the reefs of the west and north-west are exposed to relatively calm seas. These differences in the physical environment of the portions of reef bordering the small islets create an initial series of varied macrohabitats, to which are added the different conditions presented by the channels between the islets, and a lagoon of approximately 39 km in diameter, about 65 m at its deepest, with more than 2000 coral knolls or pinnacles <ref type="figure">(Fig. 83, bottom)</ref> and its own circulation system (von <ref type="bibr" target="#b298">Arx, 1948</ref>).</p><p>Basic regions and features of the reef of this atoll are shown in profile in <ref type="figure">Fig. 98</ref>.

The algal ridge has traditionally been called the " Lithothamnion ridge", and the component algae referred to as Lithothamneae or "nullipores".

This ridge, showing various degrees of development, also occurs in the Caribbean <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Adey, 1975 ;</ref>, and it therefore does not represent a difference between the reefs of Atlantic and Pacific as formerly believed <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">(Stoddart, 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Milliman, 1974)</ref>. To the region of shallow waters shoreward of the ridge I have applied the general term back-reef (or reef flat). I have not subdivided it according to predominant coral type as is commonly done, since these divisions are not meaningful to our present understanding of Halimeda distribution at Enewetak.</p><p>Water flowing across this back-reef may continue directly into the lagoon, or its passage may be interrupted by low, carbonate islets built on the reef structure. Various vertical divisions of the lagoon reef have been described, again based on types of coral, but for Halimeda there is at present little reason for stressing them. Diff"erent environments among lagoon reefs are encountered in regions adjacent to interisland channels, on the lagoon side of the passage between islets and bordering the islets themselves. The many pinnacles of the lagoon are active, tall coral heads of immense significance to the productivity and carbonate budget of the atoll.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The distribution and diversity of Halimeda at Enewetak</head><p>Fourteen species of Halimeda are known for Enewetak <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table   XXXIV)</ref>, and although the number may be higher when some of the problems of nomenclature are resolved, it is, even so, the greatest number yet reported from any specific area in the world, and is about the same as the total number of species of Halimeda known for the Atlantic Ocean. The within-habitat diversity, sensu <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">MacArthur (1965)</ref>, at any place in the atoll, however, is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Hillis-Colinvaux, 1977)</ref>. Twenty-one sites were examined during a 3 -week visit to Enewetak, and at no station were as many as half the species found ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">Fig. 97)</ref>. At only 10% of the stations were there six species, and at 40% of the stations there were three or fewer. At two stations, including the site of the Odum transect, no Halimedae were found. A station represented about 1-2 h of diving time. A striking observation first made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Gilmartin (1960)</ref> is that both sand-and rock-adapted species are found at all depths of the lagoon, from the shallows to the bottom, though relative abundance and diversity appear to decrease with depth.</p><p>Rock habitats for the species with this habitat strategy are available on the reef crest, much of the back-reef, in the inter-island channels, at (a) Halimedae on the fore-reef and the spur and groove zones. We have no data on Halimeda distributions on the fore-reef or at the greater depths below, but Jamaican experience suggests that there may well be dense populations or new species waiting to be found there. If these populations exist, they could be important to the carbonate budget of the lagoon because the strong onshore currents might be expected to carry shed segments over the reef. Species to be expected there include copiosa, opuntia, gracilis, macrophysa and gigas, with Tydemania expeditionis. This region is yet part of the "Mare Incognitum" <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">(Ladd, 1961</ref> ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">Smith and Harrison, 1977)</ref> for plants as well as for corals.</p><p>There is no published account of Halimeda on the spur and groove region, but I was able to make one collection in a transitional spur and groove region in 1975. This was on the seaward side of the islet of Mut at the south-western corner of the atoll <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">(Fig. 97</ref>) in about -10 m to -15 m of water. Four species of Halimeda were found on the spurs:</p><p>opuntia, distorta, gracilis and macrophysa, with opuntia being much less common than the others. The species distorta and gracilis sprawled over, through and around the uneven reef surface, and together with macrophysa, which has a discrete rather than spreading habit ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_33">Fig. 99</ref>), filled many of the crevices between living coral heads. Halimeda macrophysa, in addition, hung somewhat more openly on the sides of the spur.</p><p>At the time of the visit, which was mid-December, some of the branches of distorta bore rows of several flabby, relatively uncalcified segments at their growing tips, which I interpreted as indicating very rapid growth. There were also many Halimeda segments in the sand in the immediate vicinity of the spur, which could indicate an equally rapid death and separation of older segments. Blue -green algae with unbranched trichomes were associated with the Halimedae. Cover of the spurs by Halimeda was estimated as approximately 15%, and the relative conspicuousness of Halimeda on them presents a marked contrast to the buttresses of Jamaica where Halimedae were rare. No</p><p>Rhipsalian species were noted in the vicinity of the spurs, but this observation is not necessarily significant because a search could not be made in the time available.</p><p>(b) Algal ridge and hack-reef. At the seaward edge of this region,</p><p>where much of the force of the breaking waves is spent, especially on the windward side, is the Porolithon ridge, almost a pure stand of encrusting red algae. The growth form of HaUmeda is not adapted to the shock of waves as are those of calcareous reds, but the genus does grow, to some extent at least, in the passages and caverns of the surge channels. These are hung with lush green skeins which include the siphonaceous genus Bryopsis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 100)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">Taylor (1950)</ref> reports the HaUmeda species opuntia, micronesica and taenicola from this approximate region on other Marshall Islands atolls, and they might well grow on some of the seaward reefs at Enewetak. Somewhat landward from the ridge Taylor also reports opuntia, taenicola, micronesica and tridens { = incrassata), and from the inner reef flat stuposa, opuntia, hikinensis and lacunaUs, the last two in deep holes. The part of the seaward reef I could explore most readily was that of the southern tip of Enewetak Islet (south-eastern part of the atoll). <ref type="bibr" target="#b277">Stearns (1945)</ref> published on the decadent condition of this particular <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 100</ref>. Surge channel behind the algal ridge on the seaward reef of Enewetak Islet, Enewetak Atoll. Halimeda grows, to some extent at least, in the passages and caverns of these channels, although it is not shown here. The algal growth on the rock surface includes blue-greens, ulotrichean filaments and lush green skeins of Bryopsis.</p><p>reef, and Ladd in his visits of 1950 and 1952 found this and some of the other reefs of the windward shores drab <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Emery et al., 1954</ref>), a condition which has been attributed both to rate of reef growth, and to the effects of bombardment and release of fuel oil during the Second World War.</p><p>At the time of my visit to the area in 1975 the macrofiora was sparse.</p><p>There was, however, a good growth of smaller algae with much associated fauna. Many of the algae grew in short spongy turfs, and as green and blackish slimy rock coatings. The only Halimeda found was macrophysa, living in crevices behind the algal ridge, in water several centimetres deep at low tide.</p><p>In the abandoned limestone quarry of the inner back-reef of Enewetak Islet sizeable populations of the sprawlers distorta and gracilis grew, as well as macrophysa, and a bushy form of minima. The water depth is 1-1-3 m at low tide. This setting is more protected than the open reef flat. ECOLOGY AND TAXONOMY OF Holimeda (c) Inter-island channels.</p><p>In the passes between the islets the flow of water across the algal ridge and back-reef continues into the lagoon uninterrupted by land. Most of the passes are shallow, and the current usually moves strongly in only one direction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">Odum and Odum (1955)</ref>, working in one of these channels on the windward side of Enewetak, obtained a maximum current of 1-44 m sec"^during high-water neap tide, and suggested that currents were probably twice this velocity during incoming springs.</p><p>The lushest growth of opuntia I encountered at Enewetak was towards the lagoon end of one of these channels, the pass between Lojwa and Alembel on the windward side of the atoll <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">(Fig. 97)</ref>. In its shallow ( -2 m to -5 m), well-lighted, fast-moving waters almost every crevice, especially those exposed to full sunlight, seemed filled with this species. Segment shape was particularly variable, and sometimes the segments were tiny, but the characteristics were unmistakably "opuntia" . Such thalli, presented separately to the taxonomist, could well provoke at least a form epithet or two for the literature. Yet such names, under the circumstances, would have no ecological, and probably no real taxonomic significance. Flow-respirometry of one of these Halimeda channels might be expected to reveal productivities as high as any found for the Halimeda-free reef flat.</p><p>The Halimeda species lacunalis f. lata, taenicola, fragilis and micronesica also lived in these "streams", but in more sheltered locations than opuntia. The relatively abundant lacunalis f. lata grew on the seaward and lee side of corals, often under overhangs provided by the undercut coral bases, or under promontories provided by the surface.</p><p>Its segments, too, were sometimes dwarfed, and many of the apical segments grazed. In this inter -island channel it was the second most abundant Halimeda species; only opuntia was commoner. Other Udoteaceae were present too, but never prominent in any of the regions visited. This inter-island channel, lagoonward of midpoint, was one of the two sites with the greatest Halimeda species diversity encountered at Enewetak. (d) Atom bomb craters. There are six nuclear craters underwater or in the reef flats of Enewetak which provide sites for Halimeda colonists, and I examined two of them, CACTUS and <ref type="bibr">LACROSSE, in December 1975</ref>. Both are at the north end of Runit <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">(Fig. 97)</ref>. The larger, LACROSSE, formed in May 1956, is in the back-reef, whereas CACTUS, formed almost exactly two years later, is more an inpocketing of an inter-island channel <ref type="figure">(Fig. 85</ref>). Both craters are open to the sea, but CACTUS had most of the crater rim submerged, and so was flushed, in its shallows at least, with flowing reef water. Both craters were floored with very fine sediments, probably including clay-sized particles. I saw no sediments of comparable fineness elsewhere in the atoll. Both sediment bodies were contaminated with radionuclides. These craters are particularly interesting as sites for colonizers, and sites, moreover, with sediments of a size fraction not widespread in the neighbourhood. Unfortunately it is reported that CACTUS crater, the more interesting one, has been filled in as part of the recent clean-up operation on the atoll.</p><p>There were no Halimedae in LACROSSE, but a dense, pure stand of a lax form of incrassata was found in the centre of CACTUS <ref type="figure">(Fig. 85)</ref>. No population count was made of this stand, but it had the appearance of a density of 200 or more thalli per square metre. This stand was in 1 1 m of water, in the very centre of the crater, where light was poor (visibility was about 1 m), and the water murky with clay or a colloidlike suspension. The bottom was extremely soft and went into suspension at the flick of a flipper. It was also billowed, apparently by worm tubes.</p><p>Away from the centre of the crater where the slope of the floor was already apparent but at a depth of about 10 m, the straggling thalli of incrassata thinned out and merged into a grove of Caulerpa ad serrulata.</p><p>Tube worms with chitinous tubes were collected in this community. No</p><p>Halimedae were found in shallower water, and a quick survey during descent suggested that the sides of the crater were barren of plants. The crater also contained a black-tipped shark.</p><p>The dense incrassata population in CACTUS is of special interest because we found this species to be rare at Enewetak, locating no dense populations other than this one. The species incrassata is the principal Rhipsalian Halimeda in the sandy and muddy shallows at Glory Be in Jamaica. Possibly this species is restricted at Enewetak by a paucity of fine substrates. But it certainly was able to disperse to this unusual site at Enewetak, and this is one of the few pieces of data on dispersal in Halimeda that we possess. It is possible that the dense population was found in the deepest water at the centre of the crater because a vegetative propagule settled there. Had the crater not been filled in, it would have been extremely interesting to see if the resulting clone spread up the sides.</p><p>(e) The lagoon: pinnacles. With over 2000 coral knolls in the lagoon <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Emery et al., 1954)</ref> some considerable variation can be expected in their biota. Of the three on which I collected ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_32">Fig. 97)</ref>, Pole pinnacle, north-west of Rex islet, was the most interesting for Halimeda, and possessed the same high Halimeda species richness that was encountered in the fast-flowing lagoonward end of the inter-island channel between Lojwa and Alembel. Species of section Opuntia other than opuntia, the taxa copiosa, distorta and to a lesser extent minima, achieved prominence on these knolls.</p><p>The flattish top of Pole pinnacle lies approximately 4 m below the surface of the water at low tide ; its base is reached at about -40 m.</p><p>Halimeda distorta and macrophysa filled crevices between colonies of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 101</ref>. Cluster of H. copiosa on Pole pinnacle near Rex Islet at a depth of 12-15 m, in December.

The species copiosa, although present near the top with the other taxa mentioned, was more prominent under overhangs lower down <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 101)</ref>, often growing from under protuberances of the pinnacle. The thalli tended to be small, but this may be a seasonal phenomenon. Halimeda minima occurred under such overhangs too, but was not as abundant as copiosa, and other Halimeda -TTMirr -F ig. 102a. Grove of H. cylindracea in the lagoon near Enewetak Islet, Enewetak Atoll, at a depth of approximately 1 •5-2-5 m. Young, mature and old thalli are present, with many of the mature and older plants supporting relatively dense epifloral and epifaunal populations. The thalli are also silted. There is a spreading mat of bluegreen algae over portions of the sand, and shed segments of Halimeda are visible in the sand. Height range of thalli is c. 11-5-14 cm.</p><p>species were only occasional. On the South Medren pinnacle gigas was the most prominent Halimeda near the surface, that is at about -10 m.</p><p>The commonest Halimeda species on the three pinnacles in December, both on their more or less horizontal tops and their gently sloping or more often steep sides, was macro-physa. Halim^eda m,acro'physa also grew in widely scattered clumps on rock patches away from the pinnacle base. These deep-water thalli had few segments, however, in this way differing from the more familiar shrubbier plants of the sun-flooded shallows.</p><p>On two of the pinnacles Tydemania expeditionis was draped over considerable areas, in water only 8 m deep. <ref type="bibr">Gilmartin (1966) reported</ref> it as prominent at the sites of some of his deepest dives in the lagoon,</p><p>to about -63 m. Lush patches of this alga, which generally has been considered a deep-water plant, were also observed at depths of -3 m <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 102b</ref>. The lagoon floor, here near the base of south Medreii pinnacle at approximately -40 ni, appears to be essentially barren of Halimedae, although the occasional plants were observed. Some of the erect structures in this photograph in the sand near the rock outcrop, height approximately 8 cm, are cylindracea.</p><p>to -5 m on the lagoon reefs of Jimini. Among green algae Tydemania is second only to Holimeda as a carbonate producer at Enewetak. Other noteworthy algal associates of Holimeda on vertical or near vertical faces of pinnacles, particularly below 20 m, were species of Cyanophyta, their reddish or purply filaments at times streaming from under overlapping plates of coral colonies. Masses of some of these filaments also grew out of the sand-rock substrate some distance from pinnacles. These Holimeda populations of the sides of pinnacles require more study because they may well be principal suppliers of carbonate to the reef floor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Gilmartin (1960)</ref> showed, and our own dives confirm, that the lagoon floors have very low densities of Halimedae growing on them, and yet there are the various bits of drill-core evidence that Holimeda segments are important constituents of the lagoonal sediments (Section IX). Holimeda macrophysa and some of the Opuntioids growing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 103a</ref>. A part of the grove shown m <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 102a</ref>, showing the spreading algal mat over loose substrate in the foreground, and overgrowth of the older thalh. The animal mound in the upper left indicates some of the disturbances of the substrate in these communities which might effect the extent of cloning of Rhipsalian Halimedae by "runners" through the sand. Height range of the thalli in this and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 103b</ref> is approximately 9 cm. on the flanks of 2000 pinnacles may be the solution to this problem of the Halimeda sediments at Enewetak. We need Halimeda production data from pinnacles.</p><p>(f ) The lagoon shallows. Coming to an atoll with the experience of a fringing reef, it would be logical to expect the unconsolidated sediments of shallows, with associated coral rock, to be a prime site of Halimeda and carbonate production. There is certainly some, but not what might be expected if the measure is the inshore reef of the Jamaican north shore at Glory Be. At Enewetak the densities of Rhipsalian Halimedae growing on sand are much less striking than on the Jamaican fringing reef. There are more hard-substrate species, but even these do not seem abundant by the standards of a fringing reef.</p><p>The shallows on the lagoon sides of the islets have much living or dead coral and rock debris, among which sandy surfaces are not <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 103b</ref>. Many of the H. cylindracea populations at Enewetak develop in the vicinity of rock although it sometimes is buried, rather than in the more open patches of loose substrate. In the photograph, thalli of cylindracea have developed at the edge of rock substrate.</p><p>extensive. Halimeda macrophysa populations were prominent on rock surfaces or in crevices, sometimes accompanied with lesser amounts of gigas. Halimeda opuntia was much less extensive than in the island channels, though it sometimes festooned branching Acropora. All these populations were greatest in shallow water (as shallow as -1 m), but nowhere were there dense populations like those of opuntia in the rapidly moving waters of channels between islets. There also appears to be some geographic separation of populations of rock-attached forms within the atoll because in the northern parts the commonest species was none of the above three, but lacunalis f. lata. At depths of 1-2 m at low tide it was common near the undercut bases of coral heads and hidden in Acropora thickets. It is possible that it is left in these protected places by grazing pressure, for the segments showed clear signs of being nibbled, perhaps by the common parrot fish.</p><p>Two Rhipsalian species, cylindracea <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs 102, 103</ref>) and stuposa <ref type="figure">(Fig. 72, bottom)</ref>, were abundant on unconsolidated substrates of the shallows. As with the rock forms, there seems to be a geographical separation of their ranges, at least to the extent that stuposa is mostly restricted to the northern parts of the lagoon <ref type="figure">(Fig. 98)</ref>. In shallow parts in the north the two species together formed extensive meadows, though these are not really comparable to the incrassata meadows of Jamaica. Perhaps more significantly, these meadows in no way compare to the Thalassia meadows of Jamaica, not even in the apparent density of the Halimeda contribution to the Jamaican Thalassia meadows. It was remarked in the study of Glory Be that a Thalassiadominated community seemed to be involved in stabilizing patches of sand, and that Rhipsalian Halimedae were more abundant near or in these communities than in the open. Part of the low density of Rhipsalian Halimedae at Enewetak, therefore, may be a reflection of the absence of sea grasses. And this absence of sea grasses may be significant to the economy of the atoll.</p><p>(g) The lagoon floor. If the flats of the lagoon floor were covered with dense stands of Rhipsalian Halimedae, the source of the bulk of the reef carbonate would be explainable in one observation. But the floor is not so covered. This was first demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Gilmartin (1960)</ref> and our observations confirm this <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 102b</ref>). There are very low densities oi cylindracea (called monile in Gilmartin's paper), particularly near the bases of coral pinnacles. But for the most part the lagoon floor has few populations of Halimeda, and the ones that are there are rock-attached forms on coral blocks, particularly macrophysa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Gilmartin (1960)</ref> noted changes in the form of cylindracea with depth ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 104)</ref>, and postulated that the paucity of the species on the lagoon floor was a function of two processes : low light intensity and disturbance by burrowing animals. The relative prominence of animal mounds and castings on the lagoon floor near the base of pinnacles in 40 m of water certainly encourages acceptance of Gilmartin's hypothesis.</p><p>Mounds and diggings show that the bottom is constantly overturned <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 103)</ref>. Plants growing at light intensities of 5% or 10% of that at the surface may well not achieve sufficiently vigorous growth to survive such constant digging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Halimeda at Enewetak: summary</head><p>There are no obvious rivals to Halimedae as carbonate producers among the green algal macrophytes at Enewetak. Tydemania expeditionis is second, but a much lesser producer.</p><p>At least 14 species are present, of which macro'physa, opuntia, cylindracea, gigas, distorta, copiosa and lacunalis f. lata appear to be the commonest <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Hillis-Colinvaux, 1977</ref>). These, then, are the species which would contribute most to the atoll's primary productivity and calcium carbonate budgets.</p><p>Except for one collection, we have no information of the species, their species richness or biomass, seaward of the algal ridge. The high cover they provided at this one site, approximately 15% of a spur, presents a marked contrast to the spurs of Jamaica where Halimedae are rare.</p><p>It is likely that the Halimeda populations of the sides of the pinnacles are the prime producers of the Halimeda segments incorporated into the reef mass and thus are prime builders of the atoll. There are few Halimedae on the lagoon floor, and the lagoon floor, therefore, is not a prime source of Halimeda sediment.</p><p>There are no sea grasses at Enewetak, and this appears to have important consequences for Halimeda populations in unconsolidated sediments. Some of the densest sand-growing populations of Halimeda elsewhere are in association with sea-grass stands, and these dense stands are therefore not found at Enewetak. Communities of Halimeda and other algae do not seem to be able to replace sea grasses on sand substrates of the shallows. Whatever cause keeps sea grasses from Enewetak probably lowers the contribution of the lagoon shallows to the carbonate flux of the atoll.</p></div>

Imbricated arrangement of suprabasal segments is most readily seen in top plant. Specimens from less than 3 m depth, Jamaica, Sombra (smallerplant), and Runaway Bay, Spanish Cove (larger plant), IX 1967, Hillis-Colinvaux and Colinvaux. Scale bar is 2 cm long. (Photograph by The Ohio State University Department of Photography.)Habitat. Grows in sand, mud or other unconsolidated substrate, from about -0'3 to -75 m, but is comparatively uncommon at the extreme depths. HaUmeda simulans may be associated with monile in the Caribbean but is more commonly found in patches of incrassata. In the laboratory it sometimes can be initially mistaken for incrassata (see below), but in the reef it often seems fairly distinct, and sometimes can be readily spotted from above, by noting the rounder thalli in patches of Rhipsalian Halimedae. These individuals are generally simulans, since thalli of incrassata tend to have a more linear appearance. Relatively large populations of simulans may occur, or it may be present as a few thalli at the edge of a grove of incrassata.Geographic distribution.

Non-rliipsalian species have not grown as well, at least initially, and tuna has been the most difficult to maintain under these conditions.At the beginning of the cultm^e work, when looking for evidence of success, some growth observations were especially troubling. Examples include the turning white of segments or branches which then fall off, and the overburdening of thalli with epiphytes, the latter being distinct from the problem of maintaining Halimeda in culture with a minimum number of epiphytes. Both developments, however, are part of the Halimeda growth cycle.Segments and branches are shed, at least in some species, rather like leaves being dropped from a bush or tree m the autumn, and the growth</figDesc><table><row><cell>Months to Over One Year</cell></row><row><cell>1.</cell></row></table><note>followedof Halimeda is thereby different from that of Penicillus capitatus Lamarck and Udotea flabellum (Ellis and Solander) Lamouroux (Colin- vaux et al., 1965) in which there are no dehisceable units.

The ocean groups Table XIX groups the Halimeda species by region of the oceans in which they have been found. Only seven of the modern species are pantropical and are known at least for the western Atlantic, westernPacific and eastern Indian Oceans. Only one of the pantropical species has entered the Mediterranean Sea. Undoubtedly the lists for the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans will increase with more collecting, but definite patterns do emerge. Most striking of these is that characteristic species swarms of Halimedae have evolved for the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, even though the environments of each are sufficiently alike for seven species to be established throughout. The youngest basin of warm water, the Mediterranean, has no endemic species and only one of those found worldwide. This pattern seems to speak of an ancient lineage in which local speciation proceeds but slowly.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

The discrepancy with Caulerpa may be accounted for, at least partly, by differences in technique, particularly the cutting of discs from the siphonaceous Caulerpa thallus which would inevitably produce some loss and disruption of filament contents. More extensive comparisons must be made with caution since the data have been obtained by a variety of procedures, including different light intensities, and the impact of light intensity has not been fully evaluated.

The Halimeda census data for Glory Be reef that were used when calculating the flux of reduced carbon can be used for calculating the carbonate flux also, if we accept some simplifying assumptions. All Halimedae of the reef are considered to be equivalent to incrassata thalli, and the rate of loss of senile segments is considered to be constant at all parts of the reef.The more dangerous assumption is that all of the Halimedae are equivalent to incrassata, though the errors introduced may not be great in the light of the other uncertainties.Table XXX shows that of the two common rock-growing Halimedae of cushion life-form in the Table XXXII.

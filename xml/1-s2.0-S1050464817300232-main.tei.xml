			<abstract>
				<p>Fish blood is one of the crucial tissues of innate immune system, but the full repertoire of fish serum components involved in antibacterial defense is not fully identified. In this study, we demonstrated that turbot serum, but not the heat-inactivated control, significantly reduced the number of Edwardsiella tarda (E. tarda). By conjugating serum proteins with fluorescent dyes, we showed that E. tarda were coated with multiple fish proteins. In order to identify these proteins, we used E. tarda to capture turbot serum proteins and subjected the samples to shotgun proteomic analysis. A total of 76 fish proteins were identified in high confidence, including known antimicrobial proteins such as immunoglobins and complement components. 34 proteins with no previously known immunological functions were also identified. The expression of one of these proteins, IQ motif containing H (IQCH), was exclusively in fish brain and gonads and was induced during bacterial infection. This approach also allowed the study of the corresponding proteomic changes in E. tarda exposed to turbot serum, which is a general decrease of bacterial protein expression except for an upregulation of membrane components after serum treatment. Interestingly, while most other known stresses stimulate bacterial antioxidant enzymes, fish serum induced a rapid suppression of antioxidant proteins and led to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Heat treatment of fish serum eliminated this effect, suggesting that heat labile factors in the fish serum overrode bacterial antioxidant defenses. Taken together, this work offers a comprehensive view of the interactions between fish serum proteins and bacteria, and reveals previously unknown factors and mechanisms in fish innate immunity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Fishery is one of the fastest growing food-producing industries and provides nearly 50% of all culinary fish <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Fish diseases caused by bacterial infection poise a significant threat to the economy and human health <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. A better understanding of the host defense mechanisms will improve the treatment and prevention of these diseases, and may inspire the development of new antibacterial therapeutics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Unlike high vertebrates, fish rely on their innate immune system as the main line of defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Fish usually get injured by rubbing on rocks and coral, and during capturing and shipping. This kind of injuries can increase the potential entry of pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, which trigger the host defense via antibacterial peptides and proteins. In fish innate immunity, the skin and gill are generally regarded as the first line of defense against pathogens because of the anatomical location of these organs. Blood also contains antibacterial peptides and proteins which are indispensable in early innate immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. These factors in fish serum include lysozyme, lectins, pentraxins and complement components <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Previous studies reported that antimicrobial proteins and peptides like lysozyme and lectins can kill bacteria by inducing pore formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. However, pore formation is not the only mechanism of bacteria killing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Immune proteins can enter bacterial cells and bind to intracellular targets, resulting in the inhibition of molecular synthesis and enzymatic activities linked to cell wall integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Some studies reported that the cytotoxicity is caused by the simultaneous depletion of intracellular thiols and induction of metal concentrations, resulting in an oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, the molecular origins of these responses in serum-treated bacteria are not clear. As there has not been a systematic characterization of the interactions between fish serum components and bacteria, the molecular mechanism of serum-mediated bacterial killing is not fully understood.</p><p>Marine fish, as exemplified in Medaka (Oryzias melastigma), typically contain more than 1800 proteins involved in innate immunity. The functions of these proteins were postulated mainly based on the homology of their nucleotide sequences with known mammalian immune proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Further evidence on the antibacterial roles of these proteins is often limited to their enhanced expression after bacterial challenge <ref type="bibr">[15e17]</ref>. However, these techniques seldom led to the discovery of previously unknown immune proteins. Recently, proteomic techniques have been applied to discover bacteria-binding serum proteins, which are likely to be functionally related to antibacterial activities. For example, a proteomic approach was used to identify human plasma factors that bind to Streptococcus pyogenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. By combining a similar affinity-based approach with subcellular fractionation, interactions between shrimp serum proteins and the outer membrane of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were characterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, this approach is still relatively rare and has not been applied to fish.</p><p>In this study, we aim to bridge this knowledge gap by providing the first large-scale systematic characterization of the binding of fish serum proteins to waterborne pathogenic bacteria. We achieved this by using live bacteria for the affinity purification of the bacteria-binding proteins in fish serum. We used Edwardsiella tarda (E. tarda) as the model bacteria, as it is a causative agent of the loss of many economically important fish crops <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The biochemical approach used in this study requires relatively large volumes of fish serum, which necessitates the use of fish with a large body size and genome data. Hence, turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), a commercially valuable marine species known to be affected by E. tarda, was used as the fish model in this work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The use of live bacteria in this approach also enabled the parallel detection of proteomic changes within the bacteria when exposed to these serum factors. The complement system in animal sera is known to kill bacteria via assembly of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) on bacterial cell wall. While the molecular mechanism of MAC formation is well studied, the biochemical and physiological consequences in the bacteria in the wake of MAC assembly are poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Furthermore, most studies have focused on the impacts of purified preparations of complement components or cytotoxic compounds, and the combined effects of the whole serum on the protein expression of bacteria are seldom addressed. This research gap triggered us to investigate the effect of serum treatment on bacteria. The use of live E. tarda bacteria to affinity purify bacteria-binding serum proteins allowed us to examine the change in the bacterial proteome, from the same MS data, during the initial phase of serum exposure. The results of this study provide a unique molecular overview of the interplay between the fish innate immune proteins and the bacterial proteome.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Antibacterial activity of turbot serum on E. tarda</head><p>To investigate the effect of fish serum on waterborne pathogenic bacteria, we observed the viability of three species of bacteria (Edwardsiella tarda, Aeromonas hydrophila and Vibrio alginolyticus) treated with freshly collected turbot serum for 120 min. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>, turbot serum shows an antibacterial effect on all three species. Heat inactivation significantly reduced, but did not completely abolish, the cytotoxicity of turbot serum. We further tested the temporal effect of turbot serum on E. tarda <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. The number of E. tarda cells steadily decreased over time, reaching about 40% of the starting cell number after 4 h of incubation. Interestingly, heat inactivated serum suppressed the growth in bacterial population but did not induce a decrease in cell number. This suggests that turbot serum possessed heat labile factors that can kill bacteria, while heat resistant factors in the serum can block bacterial proliferation. This observation is consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. We confirmed the cell-killing effect of turbot serum by using a fluorescent viability dye <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C</ref>). Scanning electron microscopy indicated that E. tarda treated with turbot serum, but not those treated with culture medium and heat-inactivated serum, developed pores on their cell walls ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Binding of fish serum proteins to E. tarda cells</head><p>As most antibacterial proteins exert their activities by binding to bacterial cells, we asked whether intact E. tarda cells could be used to affinity-purify the antimicrobial proteins from turbot serum. We performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) on turbot serum, E. tarda cells and serum-treated E. tarda <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2AeC)</ref>. When compared to untreated bacteria <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2B</ref>), the 2D gel of serumtreated bacteria <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2C</ref>) contained a large number of additional protein spots, presumably from the binding of turbot serum proteins to the bacteria. None of these additional protein spots corresponded to the abundant proteins in the 2D gel of crude turbot serum ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>), suggesting that the bacteria-binding proteins represent a specific subset of proteins in the serum, rather than just the adhesion of abundant serum proteins in bacterial surface. To confirm that these proteins originated from fish serum and were not a result of the up-regulation of endogenous bacterial proteins, we covalently conjugated turbot serum proteins with a fluorescent dye and used the labeled proteins to treat bacteria. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2D</ref>, E. tarda incubated with the labeled serum were fluorescently decorated, suggesting the binding of serum proteins to the bacterial cells. A gel electrophoretic analysis of the treated cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2E</ref>) indicated the presence of multiple fluorescent protein species associated with the serum incubated E. tarda. Taken together, these data indicate the presence of a large number of bacteria binding proteins in turbot serum, and live E. tarda cells can be used to affinity-purify these proteins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Proteomic analysis of E. tarda-binding proteins in fish serum</head><p>We next adopted mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to systematically identify the affinity-purified turbot serum proteins. E. tarda cells with incubated with turbot serum. After rinsing away the unbound proteins, the entire serum-bacteria complex was lysed, and the released proteins were processed for MS analysis. MS/MS peak lists were interrogated against an in-house combined database that contains turbot and E. tarda genomes, which allows the identification of proteins from both species in the sample. A total of 228 turbot proteins were identified in at least one of the three technical repeats. After excluding fish proteins that were identified in only one of the repeats from further analyses, we obtained a list of 76 proteins <ref type="table">(Table S1</ref>) that we define as bacteriabinding proteins in turbot serum. Western blotting confirmed the binding of one of these proteins, ceruloplasmin, to E. tarda cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S2)</ref>. A gene ontology analysis reveals that 47 (62%) of these proteins have known immune-related functions, including eight complement components, three immunoglobulins and seven coagulation factors <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3A)</ref>. The detection of these proteins confirms the validity of our experimental approach. The remaining 29 proteins have no previously known immune or antimicrobial functions. These proteins are mainly involved in translation, DNA repair and metal binding <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3A)</ref>. Among these non-immune proteins, 49% are classified as serum or secreted proteins, consistent with the serum origin of the sample <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3B)</ref>. The identified bacteria-binding proteins do not significantly differ in size and charge from the general turbot proteome ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3C</ref>), suggesting that their binding to E. tarda cells were not likely associated with physical properties such as size or electrostatic characteristics. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3D</ref> and E shows the known interactions among the human orthologues of the identified proteins. 35% of the orthologues are known bacteria-binding proteins. The largest protein complex bound to E. tarda is involved in wound healing <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3E</ref>). Two other complexes, for complement activation and oxygen transport, were also identified ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3C and D)</ref>. 48% of the detected proteins do not have known interaction partners, possibly because these proteins are relatively less well-characterized. Our study thus allows the generation of hypotheses for the further investigations of these proteins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">IQ motif containing H (IQCH) protein is a tissue-specific factor induced by bacterial infection</head><p>As a proof of concept, we selected one of the identified bacteriabinding proteins with no known immune function for further characterization. IQCH protein is a fish homologue of the human testis-specific NYD-SP5 protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and contains the IQ (calmodulin-binding) motif. We confirmed that the expression of IQCH is highly tissue-specific in zebrafish, restricted to brain, testis and ovary ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 4A</ref>). Our proteomic data indicated that IQCH in turbot bound to E. tarda cells and implicated a function of this protein in bacterial infection. To ask whether the expression of this protein is increased during bacterial infection, we injected medaka with E. Tarda bacteria and detected IQCH RNA in the testis 12, 24 and 48 h later. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 4B</ref>, there was a surge of IQCH expression that peaked at 24 h. This is consistent with a possible role in antibacterial defense suggested by our proteomic data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Fish serum treatment leads to bacterial proteomic responses distinct from other stresses</head><p>We performed proteomic analyses on turbot serum treated E. tarda, in triplicate, for different durations (5, 30, 60, 90, 120 min). The abundance of the peptide signals in the serum-treated bacteria was compared to those in the untreated control at each time points, revealed that the number of differentially expressed proteins progressively increased over time (164e384 from 5 to 120 min, <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>). Most of the differentially expressed proteins were downregulated after 30 min of serum treatment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5A</ref>), indicating a general shutdown in protein expression when E. tarda bacteria were exposed to fish serum. Ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in energy metabolism underwent a rapid decline, in consistent with the proteomic changes demonstrated by E. coli subjected to growth inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. However, unlike nutrientrestricted bacteria, serum-treated E. tarda exhibited a rapid and significant increase in the expression of proteins involved in outer membrane protein assembly and protein transport.</p><p>We compared the protein expression profile of E. tarda after turbot serum treatment with other proteomic studies on the response of gram-negative bacteria to stress conditions or chemical toxins <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5B</ref>). While these studies also showed a general decrease of protein expression in bacteria, some pathways are selectively induced, e.g., fatty acid metabolism, anti-oxidation and carbohydrate synthesis. This suggests the existence of some active responses by the bacteria against the stresses. Our data, however, indicate that these pathways were suppressed by turbot serum. Hence, the combined activities of the components in turbot serum led to a proteomic consequence in bacteria that is distinct from all the previously studied growth-inhibitory factors. In particular, proteins involved in antioxidant defense were strongly reduced as early as 5 min after serum treatment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5C</ref>). For example, the abundance of a peptide derived from catalase, one of the major ROS scavengers in bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, was significantly reduced after turbot serum incubation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5D</ref> and E).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Turbot serum suppresses bacterial antioxidant proteins and leads to ROS accumulation</head><p>We further characterized the RNA level ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6A</ref>) and activity ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6B</ref>) of catalase in serum-treated E. tarda and confirmed the suppression of this enzyme at gene expression and functional levels. Interestingly, the effect of serum on the expression level of catalase was eliminated by a prior heating of the serum at 56 C for 30 min, suggesting that the suppression of catalase expression was mediated by heat labile, possibly protein factors. The suppression of ROS scavengers may lead to an accumulation of intracellular ROS in serum-treated bacteria. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6C</ref>, turbot serum was found to induce more ROS in bacteria. The level of ROS in serumtreated bacteria was even higher than in bacteria treated with 5 mM H 2 O 2 . This result indicates that turbot serum can induce endogenous ROS. Taken together, we demonstrated that exposure of turbot serum caused a suppression of catalase in E. tarda bacteria at RNA, protein and functional levels, probably contributing to the accumulation of ROS in serum-treated bacteria.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Discussion</head><p>In this study, we have characterized host-pathogen interactions by identifying both the bacteria-binding proteins in fish serum and the change in the bacterial proteome in response to serum treatment. This was made possible by a simple, single-pot approach of capturing bacteria-binding serum proteins by using live bacteria cells. We have identified 76 bacteria-binding proteins in turbot serum with high confidence. More than 60% of them are known bacteria-binding proteins, such as apolipoprotein E, blood clotting factors like coagulation factors and fibrinogens, oxygen transport related proteins like hemoglobin, and complement component proteins (highlighted in <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>). We have confirmed that complement components constitute the largest group of bacteriabinding serum proteins in fish. Other bactericidal proteins, such as lysozyme <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, were also identified in our experiments. In addition, our data on the binding of coagulating factors to E. tarda <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>) confirm the use of plasminogen, together with treptokinase and fibrinogen, by bacteria to neutralize the actions of complement factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Our data also show the interaction of transferrin, hemopexin and hemoglobin with E. tarda, a process used by bacteria to scavenge iron through the capture of iron-containing proteins [28e30]. These identified bacteria-binding proteins are consistent with known antibacterial mechanisms and bacterial evasion tactics.</p><p>Apart from the validation of known bacteria-binding properties of plasma proteins, our data also provide the experimental basis for the further characterization of other, less well-known immune proteins <ref type="table">(Table S1</ref>). For example, although the immune functions of warm temperature acclimation related 65 kDa protein (Wap65-2) have been proposed based on circumstantial evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, our data show for the first time its binding to bacteria cells, either directly or in complex with other proteins. In addition, we identified a number of serum proteins with no previous indication of immune-related functions or bacteria-binding properties <ref type="table">(Table S1</ref>). Our data, therefore, can be viewed as a shortlist of proteins potentially acts as factors important in host-bacteria interactions in fish. For example, we demonstrated that IQCH protein, a highly tissue-specific protein induced by bacterial infection, was present in fish serum and could bind to bacteria. Future investigations will confirm the interactions of IQCH protein, as well as other bacteria-binding serum proteins discovered in this study, with E. tarda by Western blotting and by using recombinant proteins. The functional roles of these unknown proteins in the innate immunity of fish should be addressed.</p><p>Our proteomic approach has allowed us to characterize the biochemical consequences of turbot serum treatment in E. tarda. We reported the identification and quantitation of 164, 251, 291, 277 and 384 bacterial proteins relatively from five time points (5, 30, 60, 90, 120 min) after serum treatment. As far as we know, this is the largest proteomic study of the effect of animal serum on bacteria. Although our shotgun approach limited the number of proteins that could be measured across time points, we neverthesless were able to analyze the kinetics of more than 200 bacterial proteins in response to Turbot serum <ref type="table">(Table S2)</ref>. Although the proteomic approach has been applied on gram-negative bacteria exposed to other stresses, these studies generally focused on the impact of single, isolated factors on the bacterial proteome. Fish serum is a complex mixture of molecules, in which at least 76 proteins interact with the bacteria. Here, we showed that the proteomic signature of E. Tarda in response to whole serum treatment was distinct from other previously studied environmental stresses or cytotoxic agents. This possibly represents the combined effects of the multiple serum factors on the bacteria. For example, our observation of the induction of outer membrane proteins after turbot sera treatment is consistent with their role of sequestering complement C4b protein for immune evasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The upregulation of membrane components in bacteria has also been observed after antibiotic treatment. However, unlike other stresses, fish serum appeared to induce a rapid and general shutdown of all proteins apart from outer membrane proteins.</p><p>A recent study has reported that mammalian peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), a family of evolutionary conserved antibacterial innate immunity proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, can bind to the outer membrane of E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> and induce intracellular ROS and metal concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. These findings give us a hint to the bactericidal mechanism of turbot serum proteins. In our data, serum proteins elicited a very strong inhibition on the bacteria antioxidant system <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 4)</ref>. Bacteria defend against oxidative stresses by the thioredoxin system that includes thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and by TCA cycle intermediates such as isocitrate dehydrogenase and phosphoglyceromutase <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. While these factors provide a constitutive protection, peroxide scavengers like catalase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (Ahpc) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> are rapidly induced by stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Unlike other ROS products, H 2 O 2 is more stable and can diffuse across bacterial membranes and causes more widespread damages in the cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In particular, catalases is predominant at coping with a high concentration (millimolar) or a sudden burst of H 2 O 2 because they do not require reductants like NADH, which is necessary for AphC <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. While other stresses stimulate the expression of calatase, our data show that fish serum caused a rapid and dramatic reduction of catalase expression and activity, resulting in a significant accumulation of ROS in E. tarda. As catalase is the primary detoxifier of H 2 O 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, our data suggest that heat labile factors in the serum of fish, and possibly in other animals, can specifically suppress the antioxidants in bacteria and sensitize bacteria to ROS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Our proteomic data also show that Fe-S cluster proteins were reduced, in accordance with previous studies that H 2 O 2 can damage Fe-S cluster proteins by converting stable Fe-S to an unstable [4Fee4S] 3þ <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Through this pathway, ferryl radical ([FeO] 2þ ) can be created and decay into hydroxyl radical (HO ), which can further damage DNA, proteins, and lipids synthesis, resulting in cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>In summary, our proteomic analyses on host-bacterial interactions revealed novel factors in the antibacterial actions of fish serum, and elucidated previously unknown bactericidal mechanisms. Future studies will be focused on the identification of heat labile factors in fish serum that mediate the suppression of antioxidant defenses in bacteria. This knowledge will increase our understanding of the fish innate immunity against waterborne microorganisms.</p></div>

The average length is 23.6 ± 1.01 cm. Traditional syringe method was used to extract serum from turbot. ml of serum could be taken from one fish and stored at À80 C. European Union directive 86/609/EEC are strictly adhered throughout the study. Ethics committee specifically approved this study and all animal handling procedures mentioned in this study were accepted by the Animal Ethics Committee, City University of Hong Kong. DNA barcoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> was used to confirm the species of the fish.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S1</ref>). The target band was cut and DNA was purified using the Universal DNA purification Kit (TIAN-GEN) and sequenced (BGI Hong Kong). The sequence was blasted against with BOLD gene bank (http://www.boldsystems.org/docs/ handbook.php?page%bcdatasubprotocol). Result was shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>. 33840) were cultured in Brain-heart infusion (BHI) at 25 C. Stock cultures were maintained at À80 C in a suspension of BHI containing 25% (v/v) glycerol. When required, 5 times BHI medium was added in E. tarda solution for 12 h culture and then recultured for 3 h next day to get a final concentration that is 5 Â 10 9 units (cfu)/ mL (counting by Neubauer improved cell counting chamber, 0.0025 mm 2 area) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Bactericidal assay</head><p>One ml of bacteria (at 5 Â 10 9 CFU/ml) was separately mixed with 9 ml of heat-treated (56 C, 30 min) or untreated sera and BHI. Initial bacteria numbers were measured. After incubating at room temperature for 2 h, the number of surviving bacteria was counted again using cell counting chamber. The results were expressed as the ratio of bacteria number in each experimental group relative to that of the initial values. In some experiments, E. tarda survival rate during 4 h incubation (counted every 30 min) with or without serum was determined as described previously. Three replicates were used per experiment. In some experiments, the bacteria were labeled by the LIVE/DEAD ® BacLight Bacterial Viability Kits (molecular probes, Invitrogen Detection Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images were taken under a confocal microscope (Leica SPE). 2) for 24 h at 4 C. The cells were then washed in 0.1 M, 0.05 M and 0.025 M of PBS for 10 min each. Samples were then dehydrated through a graded ethanol series of 30, 50, 70, 80 and 95% v/v for 10 min each, washed thrice with 100% ethanol for 10 min each and with acetone twice for 15 min each. With the use of carbon tape, the samples were mounted on aluminium stubs. Sputter coating was performed using gold before imaging. The coated samples were observed under a XL30 ESEMFEG environmental scanning electron microscope (Philips Electronics, Netherlands, Europe).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis</head><p>For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, 48 mg of bacterial lysate or turbot serum was mixed with (IPG) rehydration buffer (8 M urea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.5% (v/v) immobilized pH gradient (IPG) buffer, 0.002% bormophenol blue and 18 mM DTT) and loaded onto a 7 cm Iso-Electric Focusing (IEF) strip (pH 4e7, GE Healthcare). The proteins were allowed to rehydrate overnight at room temperature and then separated in the first dimension of gel electrophoresis by using a commercial flatbed electrophoresis system (GE Healthcare Ettan IPGphor III, Freiburg, Germany), The samples on the pH 4e7 linear strips begins with a relatively low voltage (300 v, 0.5 h), and second round strips go through a gradient running (1000 v, 0.5 h; 5000 v, 1.5 h). In the last step, strips run at 5000 V for half an hour. After the isoelectric focusing, the IPG strips were treated with 2% (w/v) SDS, 6 M urea, 29.3% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.002% bromophenol blue and alkylation followed by 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 15 min and then placing the strip on 12% (w/v) acrylamide gel for the second dimension of gel electrophoresis. The gels were stained with Coomassie blue and a quantitative analysis of spot intensity from 2DE was performed by using an image analysis software (Nonlinear Dynamics Progenesis SameSpots version 2.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Binding of fluorescently conjugated serum proteins to bacteria</head><p>Turbot serum was diluted with HBSS (pH 7.4) and labeled by Amersham CyDye DIGE Fluor Cy5 (minimal dye) (GE Healthcare, code No. 28-9345-33) for 30 min on ice in the dark. The reaction was quenched by 10 mM lysine for 10 min. After labeling, fluorescently conjugated serum was used to incubate bacteria for 2 h. To remove unbound proteins multiple washing with HBSS (pH7.4) was performed (10,000 g, 2 min). Pellets were then lysed in 7 M Urea, 2 M Thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 2% (v/v) IPG Buffer and 40 mM DTT and sonicated (4 min, 70% amplification). The proteins concentration of E. tarda was measured with a colorimetric assay based on the Bradford method (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL. USA). 40 mg of bacteria proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was first scanned with a scanner (Fujifilm FLA-9000) and post-stained with Coomassie blue (Serva 17525). Values are expressed as mean ± SD (n ¼ 3). ** denotes statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.01) with respect to the control group. (B) Catalase activity in bacteria treated with or without serum for 60 min. One unit (U) of catalase was defined as the amount of enzyme that decomposed 1 mmol of H 2 O 2 per minute under the assay conditions at 520 nm. (C) E. tarda was incubated with culture medium (BHI), 5 mM H2O2 and turbot serum (TS) for 30 and 60 min. 10 mM DCFH-DA was added in each group after multiple washing with PBS.</p><p>Images were taken under a fluorescent microscope with excitation 480 nm and emission 520 nm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Western blotting</head><p>10 mg lysates from treated or untreated bacteria prepared as described above were separated in 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Pall corporation, Pensacola, FL, USA Lot: T02465) by using the XCell Surelock minicell blotting module (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, anti-Ceroloplasmin (Cat No: 5723, AnaSpec, Fremont, CA, USA) was used as the primary antibody with a dilution of 1:500 in 5% milk. The blot was followed incubated in 1:2000 secondary antibodies in 5% milk. The antibodies were detected by using enhanced chemilumi-nescence (Western Bright ECL, Advansta, California, USA) horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-based assays and the signal captured by LAS 4000 chemiluminescent imager (Fuji).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.8.">Mass spectrometry</head><p>Bacteria with or without turbot serum treatment (for 5, 30, 60, 90 or 120 min) were washed and lysed in 8 M urea for 2 h as described above. The lysate was reduced in 10 mM DTT in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (30 min at room temperature) and alkylated in 50 mM IAA in 50 mM ammonium bio-carbonate (20 min at room temperature). The samples were diluted with ammonium bicarbonate (50 mM, pH 8.0) so that the final concentration of urea was 1 M, followed by 2 mg trypsin (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) digestion. The mixtures were then incubated overnight at 37 C and dried in a vacuum centrifuge (Eppendorf concentrator plus). Peptides were dissolved in 20 ml 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), followed by ZipTip (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) purification according to the manufacturer's instruction.</p><p>All mass spectrometry data were collected on an Orbitrap Fusion Mass Spectrometer (MS) (ThermoFisher Scientific™, San Jose, CA) coupled to a Proxeon EASY-nLC liquid chromatography (LC) pump (ThermoFisher Scientific™). Peptides were eluted using microcapillary column 50 cm Â 75 mm ID, PepMap C18, 2 mm of particles (ThermoFisher Scientific™). The peptides were separated by using 2 h gradient of 2e90% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of~350 nL/min. They were ionized by electrospray ionization by applying a positive 2.5 kV potential to a laser pulled spray tip at the end of the analytical column. Survey scans of peptide precursors from 350 to 1550 m/z were performed at 120 K resolution at 200 m/ z. Tandem MS was performed by isolation at 1.2 Th with the quadrupole, CID fragmentation with normalized collision energy of 35%, and rapid scan MS analysis in the ion trap. The MS2 ion count target was set to 104 and the max injection time was 250 ms only those precursors with charge state 2e7 were fragmented for MS2. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to 60 s with a 10 ppm of low and high mass tolerance around the selected precursor and its isotopes. The instrument was run in top speed mode with 3 s cycles, meaning the instrument would continuously perform MS2 events until the list of non excluded precursors diminishes to zero or 3 s, whichever is shorter and the data dependent top 20 precursors were selected for MS2.</p><p>The MS/MS peak lists were exported as an .mgf file, and proteins were identified via automated Mascot database searching (Matrix Science 2.2.04) of all tandem mass spectra against of a custom made database containing flounder fish and E. tarda genomes (72762 sequences, NCBI). The instrument setting for the Mascot search was specified as "ESI-FTICR." Parameters used for the database search were as follows: a maximum of two miss cleavages; carbamidomethyl-ation of cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as variable modifications; trypsin as the enzyme; a peptide mass tolerance of 10 ppm; a fragment mass tolerance of 0.2 Da; and an ion score of 29 as the cut off, using a significance threshold of p &lt; 0.05. After peptide identification, any peptides that had conflicting assignments were resolved, either one of identical proteins or by assignment to proteins with the largest number of peptides already present (by following Occam's Razor principle).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.9.">Peptide quantitation</head><p>Peptide quantitation was processed by using Progenesis LC-MS (version 4.1, Nonlinear) and as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Briefly, the profile data of two sample groups with triplicates for each were converted to MS features. After "Automatic Alignment", all features with charge ranged from þ2 to þ7 were subjected to normalization. Following a statistical analysis was processed by using transformed "log-like" arcsin (ANOVA) calculations of all the detected features. The total cumulative abundance was calculated by summing the abundance of all peptides belonged to the respective protein. Proteins were then ranked by p-value (one-way ANOVA) based on the sum of the normalized abundance across all runs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.10.">Quantitative real-time PCR</head><p>Total RNA were isolated from different organs (eyes, heart, liver, intestines, muscle, skin, testis, kidney, brain, gill, spleen) of male and female ovary were isolated to test the IQCH expression level in zebrafish (three biological replicates) by using the RNAprep pure Cell/Bacteria kit (TIANGEN), then reverse transcribed into cDNA using the One-Step FastQuant RT Reagent Kit with gDNase (TIAN-GEN). In brief, qPCR assays were performed using the fluorescent dye Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and ABI 7500 System. Genespecific primers were designed with the Primer-BLAST (NCBI). Specific primers were designed based on the sequence of the mRNA by NCBI blast primer software. IQCH primer sequence: forward 5 0 -TGCTCCAGAGAGAGGACAGT-3 0 ; reverse 5 0 -CAGAAGCAGCT-GAAGGTGGA-3 0 . To detect function of IQCH in immune system, Â 10^7 CFU/ml E. tarda were injected in medaka fish (Oryzias melastigma). As a comparison, the same volume of PBS was injected into fish. Each group has 4 biological replicates. After 12, 24, 48 h post injection, Total RNA were extracted from testis of infected fish and normal fish.

Catalase (kat) primer sequence: forward 5 0 -CTCCTTCGAGGTTCTGGAGC-3 0 , reverse 5 0 -ACCGATCAG-CACCGTCATTT-3 0 . 16s rRNA was used as the reference gene to normalize gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The relative expression levels (fold change) of the tested genes were calculated by using the relative expression based on the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) Method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.11.">Catalase assay</head><p>The catalase activity of E. tarda with or without 1 h turbot serum incubation was determined using an OxiSelect catalase activity assay kit (catalog number STA-341; Cell Biolabs, Inc.). The reaction was arrested after 1 min and the absorbance was measured at 520 nm. The catalase activity was calculated by standard curve generated with the catalase standard supplied with the kit. The result was expressed as U/mg. One unit of catalase is the amount of enzyme that can decomposed 1 mmole of H 2 O 2 per minute at 25 C.</p></div>

			<abstract>
				<p>Heat stress is the most common factor for coral bleaching, which has increased both in frequency and severity due to global warming. In the present study, the stony coral Acropora aculeus was subjected to acute heat stress and entire transcriptomes were sequenced via the next generation sequencing platform. Four paired-end libraries were constructed and sequenced in two groups, including a control and a heat stress group. A total of 120,319,751 paired-end reads with lengths of 2 Â 100 bp were assembled and 55,021 coral-derived genes were obtained. After read mapping and abundance estimation, 9110 differentially expressed genes were obtained in the comparison between the control and heat stress group, including 4465 significantly upregulated and 4645 significantly downregulated genes. Twenty-three GO terms in the Biological Process category were overrepresented for significantly upregulated genes, and divided into six groups according to their relationship. These three groups were related to the NF-kB signal pathway, and the remaining three groups were relevant for pathogen response, immunocyte activation and protein ubiquitination. Forty-three common genes were found in four GO terms, which were directly related to the NF-kB signal pathway. These included 2 NACHT, LRR, PYD domainscontaining protein, 5 nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein, 29 NLRC3-like protein, 4 NLRC5-like protein, and 3 uncharacterized protein. For significantly downregulated genes, 27 overrepresented GO terms were found in the Biological Process category, which were relevant to protein ubiquitination and ATP metabolism. Our results indicate that heat stress suppressed the immune response level via the NLRC3-like protein, the fine-tuning of protein turnover activity, and ATP metabolism. This might disrupt the balance of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis and result in the bleaching of the coral A. aculeus.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Coral reefs are one of the central marine ecosystems in tropical and subtropical oceans that accommodate significant biodiversity. Stony corals play a central role in forming the structure of coral reefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and to fulfil the photosynthesis of symbiotic zooxanthellae whose habitat includes shallow seas with stable water quality and good illumination conditions. In the coral-zooxanthella symbiosis, stony coral provides carbon dioxide and inorganic nutrients for engaged photosynthetic zooxanthella, while zooxanthella supplies oxygen and organic nutrients to stony coral <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, over the past three decades and coinciding with climate change, the phototrophic symbiotic stony coral has suffered from diseases that increase both in frequency and severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Global warming due to climate change involves shifts of the mean annual sea surface temperature, which in turn has threatened the survival and reproduction of stony coral. The morphological and physiological response to heat stress is known as coral bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, a process whereby stony corals either lose their symbiotic zooxanthellae, or whereby the zooxanthellae's photosynthetic pigments degrade. The resulting disruption of the symbiosis between coral and zooxanthellae causes increased mortality and decreased coral adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In recent years, the increased sea surface temperature has caused severe coral bleaching events both with increasing frequencies and intensities, and stony coral is declining at an unsustainable rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Coral bleaching has adversely affected the balance and sustainability of coral reef ecosystems, and therefore attracted increasing research attention.</p><p>Reasons of coral bleaching have been investigated in detail for two aspects of the symbiosis. With respect to the coral, the physiological responses of stony corals to heat stress have been investigated, including the photoprotective mechanisms (MAAs), changes of fluorescent pigments, molecular chaperone mechanisms, apoptosis regulation, and redox equilibrium <ref type="bibr">[7e9]</ref>. It has been concluded that oxidative damage due to an excess of oxygen free radicals, could induce coral bleaching during the exposure to elevated temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. With respect to zooxanthellae, the susceptibility of stony corals to bleaching has been suggested to relate to the genotype of its symbiotic zooxanthellae, because certain genotypic zooxanthellae were found to tolerate high temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. For example, Symbiodinium thermophilum sp. nov. has been considered as a thermotolerant symbiotic zooxanthellae, allowing the survival of corals in the world's warmest sea, the Persian/Arabian Gulf <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In addition, it has also been reported that excess symbiotic zooxanthellae increased the susceptibility of stony corals to bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Therefore, coral bleaching is suggested to represent a systemic reaction of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis to heat stress. Its detailed mechanism is complicated, and still far from well understood.</p><p>Acropora aculeus is a species of stony coral that can be found throughout the Indian Ocean, the central Indo-Pacific, the western Pacific, Australia, Southeast Asia, Japan and the East China Sea. This stony coral is particularly susceptible to coral bleaching, disease, and predation by the crown-of-thorns starfish. As an approach from systemic biology, the next generation sequencing technology has been applied to significantly expand the transcriptome resources of corals [16e20]. In the present study, the transcriptomic response of the coral A. aculeus to heat stress was investigated with next generation sequencing technology, thus paving a new way to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of coral bleaching and environmental adaption. The purpose of this study was to (1) identify the transcripts from coral A. aculeus, (2) survey differentially expressed genes of corals under acute heat stress, and (3) investigate the potential physiological changes that result from these differentially expressed genes. This enabled to understand the molecular mechanism that underlies heat bleaching of the coral A. aculeus.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Corals</head><p>Samples of the stony coral A. aculeus were collected from the coral reef in Lingshui, Hainan Province, China. Corals were maintained in filtered seawater flow-through aquaria at 26 C (with a volume of several hundred liters), at facilities at the Hainan University. Four fluorescent bulbs (Philips T5HO Activiva Active 54 W) produced the light and the corals were subjected to a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle for one month to adjust to laboratory conditions and were allowed to recover from the fragmentation until the onset of the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Heat stress treatment</head><p>To avoid potential influences of inter-colony variability and genetic background, the experiment was performed with clones of the same A. aculeus isolate. An aquaria containing heated seawater (32 C) was prepared. Coral nubbins were randomly divided into two groups, and assigned to either control or heat stress groups.</p><p>The coral nubbins of the control group were kept in 26 C seawater, while the coral nubbins of the heat stress group were directly transferred to 32 C seawater. After 12 h of heat stress, all coral nubbins were sampled with two biological repetitions per group. Each sample was immediately stored in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Construction and deep sequencing of transcriptome libraries</head><p>Coral nubbins were ground in liquid nitrogen and 1 ml Trizol reagent was added (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The obtained mixture was then transferred into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 5000 rpm, 4 C for 5 min, thus discarding the calcium carbonate skeleton. Subsequently, the total RNA was isolated following a protocol described by Stefanik <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The harvested total RNA was quantified via Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific) at 260/280 nm (ratio &gt; 2.0) and its integrity was confirmed with the Angilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Four paired-end fragment libraries (2 Â 100 bp) were constructed and sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq4000 platform according to manufacturer's instructions (BGI, Shenzhen, China). The raw sequencing reads were submitted to the NCBI Short Read Archive under the accession number SRP068263.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Assembly of coral and zooxanthella transcripts</head><p>The raw reads obtained via Illumina sequencing were preprocessed with the Fastx-toolkit pipeline (http://hannonlab.cshl. edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html). Adaptor sequences were removed with the trimmer function, and the quality filter removed all sequences in which 80% of the base pairs had a Phred score below 20. The clean reads obtained from four libraries were merged to assemble transcripts and genes, using the software package Trinity (http://trinityrnaseq.github.io/) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Coral and zooxanthella transcripts were further differentiated via the homologous alignment method with the BLAST software as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The genome sequences of the coral Acropora digitifera and the zooxanthellae Symbiodinium minutum and Symbiodinium kawagutii have been finished <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, and their annotated protein sequences were downloaded and merged to construct a protein BLAST database. All assembled transcripts were aligned to the protein database via local BLASTX program (evalue &lt; 0.00001, max_target_seqs ¼ 1). Transcripts with encoded proteins sharing higher sequence similarity with that from A. digitifera than S. minutum or S. kawagutii were regarded as coral-derived transcripts. Furthermore, transcripts were defined as originating from zooxanthella that encoded proteins with higher sequence similarity with proteins from S. minutum or S. kawagutii. Coral transcripts and corresponding genes were used for subsequent reads mapping and function annotation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Function annotation of assembled coral transcripts</head><p>Likely coding regions of the assembled coral genes were identified, and their encoding proteins were retrieved using the software package TransDecoder (http://transdecoder.github.io/). These genes and proteins were aligned via local BLASTX and BLASTP programs to the SwissProt databases (max_target_seqs ¼ 1). Furthermore, protein domain identification (HMMER/PFAM) and signal peptide and transmembrane region prediction (signalP/ tmHMM) were completed, leveraging various annotation databases (eggNOG/GO/Kegg databases), following the procedure of the Trinotate software (http://trinotate.github.io/). These obtained results were fed into the Trinotate SQLite database for functional annotation, and GO terms were assigned to all assembled coral transcripts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Identification of differentially expressed genes</head><p>The assembled coral transcripts served as reference sequences for reads mapping, and a GTF annotation file was constructed with an in-house Perl script. Alignment of all paired-end reads was performed with the TopHat software package (http://ccb.jhu.edu/ software/tophat/index.shtml), and Cufflinks software (http://coletrapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/) was used to estimate the gene expression abundance and to identify the differentially expressed genes between two groups (pooled, FDR &lt; 0.05) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Differential expression analysis was graphically presented using the CummeRbund package included in the R/Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ cummeRbund.html).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">GO overrepresentation analysis of differentially expressed genes</head><p>Identification of differentially expressed genes generated two gene lists, including both significantly upregulated and downregulated gene lists. GO overrepresentation analysis was implemented via hypergeometric test with an FDR value of 0.01. Differentially expressed genes were selected as test set, while all assembled coral genes were used as reference set. Significantly overrepresented GO terms were calculated from the test set, and displayed as a network, using the BiNGO plug-in to Cytoscape (http://cytoscape.org/) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Construction and sequencing of transcriptome libraries</head><p>The transcriptomes of stony coral A. aculeus subjected to heat stress were sequenced with the Illumina Hiseq4000 platform. A total of four paired-end transcriptome libraries were constructed, including two libraries in the control group and two libraries in the heat stress group. To compare the abundance of gene expression, these four libraries were sequenced to saturated level. After filtration of low-quality sequence and adaptor sequence, a total of 120,319,751 paired-end reads with a length of 2 Â 100 bp were obtained, including 30,435,303 and 29,084,044 reads from two control libraries, as well as 30,648,486 and 30,151,918 reads from two heat stress libraries, respectively (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Transcript assembling and differentiation</head><p>The coral-zooxanthella symbiont transcripts were assembled with the Trinity software package, and they were further differentiated with BLASTX program. All four libraries were merged and submitted to the Trinity software for de novo transcriptome assembly. A total of 404,796 transcripts (N50 ¼ 1722 bp) were obtained, which corresponded to 267,075 genes (N50 ¼ 1269 bp). These transcripts were aligned to the BLAST protein database from the coral A. digitifera and the zooxanthellae S. minutum and S. kawagutii. Among all assembled transcripts, the encoded proteins of 122,988 transcripts (55,021 genes, transcript N50 ¼ 2597 bp, gene N50 ¼ 2589 bp) shared higher homology with A. digitifera, and were consequently defined as the transcripts of coral A. aculeus. Likewise, the encoded proteins of 80,798 transcripts (51,461 genes, transcript N50 ¼ 1840 bp, gene N50 ¼ 1691 bp) that shared higher homology with either S. minutum or S. kawagutii were regarded as the transcripts of symbiotic zooxanthellae <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Abundance estimation of gene expression</head><p>High-quality clean reads were aligned with TopHat software to the reference sequence built from the assembled coral transcripts. The mapping rates of all four libraries ranged from 41.90% to 45.20%, and the unique mapping rates ranged from 35.30% to 36.50%, respectively ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). The relatively small difference of mapping rates and unique mapping rates among all four libraries indicated the existence of lower genetic variability between different nubbins in the A. aculeus colony, and these libraries could be used for the subsequent bioinformatics analysis.</p><p>Gene expression abundance was analyzed via Cufflinks software, and the expression level of each gene was calculated via the method of Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments mapped (FPKM). The overall expression level of coral genes was estimated with the CummeRbund package. The PCA plot was based on gene expression levels of four samples in both groups and revealed that the samples correlated more highly within groups than between groups <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>, and a dendrogram of Jensen-Shannon distances displayed the similarity among the gene expressions in four samples and well parallelism among two replicates of each group <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S1</ref>). The expression levels of all genes are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>. Expression levels of 47,200 and 47,500 genes were detected in the control and heat stress groups, respectively. Furthermore, 642 genes had an FPKM &gt;100 and 21,059 with FPKM &lt;1 among the detectable genes within the control group. The numbers of genes with FPKM &gt;100 and FPKM &lt;1 were 652 and 20,724 in the heat stress group, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Identification of differentially expressed genes</head><p>Gene expression differences were determined with the cuffdiff module in A. aculeus following heat stress.

Four GO terms at lower depth level in the GO tree were directly related to the NF-kB signal pathway, including the negative regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity (GO:0032088, group 1, 54 genes), regulation of the I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade (GO:0043122, group 2, 64 genes), the negative regulation of I-kap-paB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade (GO:0043124, group 2, 43 genes) and the I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade (GO:0007249, group 3, 54 genes). Venn analysis (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/ index.html) revealed 43 common genes among the four GO terms <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6</ref>).

This furthermore suggest that the assembly and differentiation of coral transcripts was reliable in the present study, and that the obtained coral transcripts and genes could be used in the expression abundance analysis. Due to uncertainty of the  species and type of symbiotic zooxanthellae in the experimental coral A. aculeus, the transcriptome response was not analyzed in the present study. In addition, other transcripts without homologies have also not been analyzed further, as they potentially derived  <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Three overrepresented GO term groups correlated with the NF-kB signal pathway for significantly upregulated genes in the coral Acropora aculeus under heat stress. <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. The overrepresented GO term group correlated with pathogen response and immunocyte activation for significantly upregulated genes in the coral Acropora aculeus under heat stress. from other types of zooxanthellae and fungi.</p><p>To understand the potential response of the stony coral to heat stress and to further systematically investigate their bleaching mechanism, the transcriptome libraries of A. aculeus subjected to heat stress were sequenced with the Illumina Hiseq4000 platform. This high throughput RNA-Seq method enabled identification of a large number of differentially expressed genes under heat stress. Statistical analysis revealed relative dispersion and parallelism between two repeats per group, suggesting that the transcriptome comparison was of higher statistical confidence. A total of 9110 differentially expressed genes were identified in the comparison between the control and heat stress groups, including 4465 significantly upregulated and 4645 significantly downregulated genes. A gene expression abundance analysis demonstrate that the transcriptome of A. aculeus had been remodeled under heat stress, which might cause pigment loss and result in consequent coral bleaching. RNA-Seq analysis for transcriptome profiling has been suggested as a robust and reliable strategy to assess transcriptional responses of the coral species to various environmental conditions, and also as a powerful approach to reveal the molecular basis for environmental adaption.</p><p>To further understand the physiological change of the coral under heat stress, GO overrepresentation analyses of these differentially expressed genes were conducted using BiNGO software. A total of 23 overrepresented GO terms were found at multiple levels in the Biological Process category for the 4465 significantly upregulated genes. These could be divided into six groups according to their relationship. Three groups were related to the NF-kB signal pathway, while the other two groups were relevant to both pathogen response and immunocyte activation. This result indicate that the expression levels of several immune-related genes could be modulated via the NF-kB signal pathway in the coral A. aculeus under heat stress. The NF-kB signal pathway had been reported to be involved in the response to eutrophication and heat stress in the stony corals Galaxea fascicularis and Acropora millepora, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. In the present study, a novel modulation mode of the NF-kB signal pathway was revealed in the stony coral under heat stress. In the four overrepresented GO terms, which were at a lower level and directly related to the NF-kB signal pathway, 43 common genes were involved in the negative regulation of the NF-kB signal pathway. Twenty-nine NLRC3-like proteins accounted for 67.4% of all common genes, which had been reported to be negative regulators of innate immune signaling that attenuates Toll-like receptor signaling via modification of the signaling adaptor TRAF6 and the transcription factor NF-kB <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. Furthermore, the result presented here, was consistent with the observation that TRAF-6 and NF-kB gene expressions were downregulated after exposure to elevated seawater temperatures in the stony coral Acropora aspera <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Therefore, our results suggest that heat stress could suppress the immune response of coral A. aculeus via negative regulation of the NF-kB signal pathway by the NLRC3-like protein, which resulted in coral bleaching due to increased susceptibility to pathogenic microorganisms. Several reports in coral O. faveolata and P. damicornis also support a possible suppression of the immune response under heat stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. A suppression of the immune response would result in the susceptibility of the corals to pathogenic microorganisms, and further influencing the balance of coralzooxanthellae symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>For the 4645 significantly downregulated genes, 27 overrepresented GO terms were assigned to the Biological Process category. These GO terms were further divided into six groups, two of which were relevant to protein ubiquitination. There was also an ubiquitination-related and overrepresented GO term for significantly upregulated genes. This suggests protein ubiquitination to be dynamically and accurately regulated under heat stress. A finetuned protein ubiquitination might aim to degrade the inactivating proteins induced by heat stress in coral A. aculeus, which was also reported for the corals Porites lobata and Montastraea faveolata in a state of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Furthermore, the other two groups of overrepresented GO terms were related to the ATP metabolism. ATP concentrations have been reported to significantly drop in A. hyacinthus during a bleaching event as a result of the natural disturbance <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The reduced expression of ATP metabolismrelated genes might result in an alteration of the ATP concentration in A. aculeus, which would further affect the coral energy budget in the stress response. For example, because ATP can supply direct energy to most physiological activities, especially to molecular chaperones, which use this supplied ATP energy to recover the correct conformation of proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Therefore, an alteration of the ATP concentration would negatively impact protein repair and degradation in A. aculeus under heat stress. These results indicated that protein ubiquitination and ATP metabolism could be modulated to influence protein metabolism, which would further influence the balance of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis.</p><p>The coral A. aculeus is particularly susceptible to bleaching and disease. In conclusion, we found a repressed level of immune response, a fine-tuned protein turnover activity, and reduced ATP metabolism in coral A. aculeus when subjected to heat stress. These physiological changes might disrupt the symbiotic balance between the stony coral and zooxanthellae, resulting in coral bleaching and eventually, death of the coral A. aculeus. The repression of the immune response leads to disarray of the dynamic maintenance of the type and quantity of symbiotic zooxanthellae, while the invasion risk of pathogenic microorganisms increases considerably <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. In addition, an increased seawater temperature has been reported to increase the abundance and alter the structure of natural Vibrio populations that are associated with the stony coral <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. A large number of invasive pathogenic microorganisms compete with the coral and symbiotic zooxanthellae for limited resources, resulting in the loss of the symbiotic zooxanthellae or the degradation of the photosynthetic pigments of the symbiont. This could ultimately result in coral bleaching and death <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The fine-tuned protein turnover activity and ATP metabolism might also contribute to a disruption of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiotic balance and an associated burst of coral bleaching, <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Grouping of differentially expressed genes in four overrepresented GO terms (GO:0032088, negative regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity; GO:0043122, regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade; GO:0043124, negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade; GO:0007249, I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade) were directly related to the NF-kB signal pathway for significantly upregulated genes in the coral Acropora aculeus under heat stress. since biological metabolism and energy budget are of important significance for normal physiological activity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Number of assembled coral genes, assembled zooxanthella genes, total differentially expressed genes, significantly upregulated genes, and significantly downregulated genes.</figDesc></figure>

			<abstract>
				<p>The objective of this study was to identify the gonadal somatic cells in the Yesso scallop using a novel molecular marker. This study is the first to identify the bone morphogenetic protein 2a (Bmp2a) gene as a gonadal somatic cell-specific gene in this bivalve. We performed a transcriptomic survey to identify the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) superfamily members that act in Yesso scallop gonad development. BLAST survey, phylogenetic tree, and RT-PCR analyses screened BMP molecules (i.e., bmp2a and bmp10a), which are members of the TGFβ superfamily that show gonad-specific expression. Among the BMPs from the Yesso scallop, in situ hybridization accompanied by RNAscope assay identified that bmp2a mRNA was specifically expressed in the gonadal somatic cells localized in the interspace between germ cells. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that bmp2a mRNA expression increased during the reproductive phase. The relative expression of bmp2a mRNA was lowest at the beginning of the growing stage and peaked at the mature stage in both sexes. These observations indicate that bmp2a-positive gonadal somatic cells support germ cell growth and differentiation during the reproductive phase for both sexes. This study provides new insights into gonadal somatic cell biology in marine invertebrates and we propose that TGFβ signaling is necessary for gonad development in bivalves. ability to control germ cell fate (Jemc, 2011). Research on fish gonadal somatic cells has revealed fundamental knowledge regarding the essential functions of gonadal somatic cells in guiding germ cell development and supporting gametogenesis. For example, during embryogenesis, gonadal somatic cells play a critical role in guiding the primordial germ cell migration by secreting a chemokine (Herpin et al., 2008). In testis, Leydig cells produce sex steroids and Sertoli cells nurse germ cells by providing structural, nutritional, and hormone-regulatory support (Schulz et al., 2010). In the ovary, theca cells supply an androgen substance for granulosa cells to produce estradiol-17 beta (E 2) for oocyte growth and maturation (Lubzens et al., 2010). These observations indicate that gonadal somatic cells are capable of differentiation that supports germ cell development, such as</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Aquatic organisms have evolved unique reproductive organs. Evolutionary processes have resulted in various germinal acinus structures that are associated with a variety of reproductive strategies. In fish, gonadal cells consist of gonadal somatic cells and germ cells from larval to adult stage. The fish germ cells have been clearly characterized with various molecular markers, whereas those of marine invertebrates have been rarely characterized and with few markers. For example, mitotic germ cells (i.e., oogonia and spermatogonia) of Pacific oyster were identified by a vasa-like gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Fabioux et al., 2004)</ref>. In addition, immature germ cells (i.e., spermatogonia and oogonia or primary oocytes) in Stony coral were identified by piwi <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Shikina et al., 2015)</ref>. These germ cell markers have enabled us to visualize germ cell distribution during embryogenesis and gonad development throughout the reproductive cycle. In contrast to germ cell studies, there has been less focus on gonadal somatic cells, even though somatic cells have a crucial by germ cell migration, proliferation, sex differentiation, and maturation processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Schulz et al. (2010)</ref> reviewed the basic structure of the spermatogenic tubule segment in fish with cystic-type spermatogenesis, unlike in mammals. In fish, each spermatogenic/ovarian cyst is encircled by Sertoli cells or granulosa cells, respectively. These cystic structures were revealed by studies of gonadal somatic cells in fish reviewed in elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Schulz et al., 2010)</ref>. Therefore, gonadal somatic cell markers in marine invertebrates are powerful tools for identifying gonadal somatic cells and visualizing germinal tubule segment structure associated with cystic-type spermatogenesis, which can help us better understand gametogenesis.</p><p>As an example of a gonadal somatic cell-specific gene, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Sawatari et al., (2007)</ref> first characterized gonadal soma-derived growth factor (gsdf) from rainbow trout and reported that the Gsdf recombinant protein promoted primordial germ cell proliferation; therefore, they proposed that paracrine transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling is involved in germ cell development. gsdf is a member of the TGFβ superfamily but it is not assigned to any of known subfamilies of this group. Importantly, gsdf is not found in tetrapods and widely characterized in teleosts, such as the medaka Oryzias latipes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Shibata et al., 2010)</ref> and zebrafish Danio rerio <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Yan et al., 2017)</ref>. In addition, gsdf was identified in the coelacanth Latimeria menadoensis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Forconi et al., 2013)</ref>, which indicates that gsdf was acquired from a two rounds of whole-genome duplication event. Although all gsdf homologs exhibited Sertoli/granulosa cell-specific expression and can be used as a gonadal somatic cell marker in fish, no ortholog has been characterized in invertebrates.</p><p>Among marine invertebrates, the phylum Mollusca includes over 100,000 species that have evolved unique reproductive organs. Therefore, Mollusca is an interesting animal phylum for studying the evolution of diversified reproductive systems. However, little is known about molecular markers that can identify molluscan gonadal somatic cells. To the best of our knowledge, oyster-gonadal-TGFβ-like (og-TGFβ-like) in Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas shows gonadal somatic cell-specific expression in both sexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fleury et al., 2008)</ref>. in vivo knockdown of og-TGFβ-like led to reduced gonad area (23% less) for both sexes and halted vitellogenesis, which indicates a function of growth factor in germ cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Huvet et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Our research investigated bivalve reproductive physiology by examining the Yesso scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis, which is advantageous as an experimental animal because it has high commercial value in aquaculture. The Yesso scallop is a completely gonochoric species with a morphologically separated gonad organ, which allows us to analyze the gonad development, sex differentiation, and sexual maturity. For the annual reproductive cycle, Yesso scallops normally enter the growing phase in winter and spawn in spring once per year in the northern coast of Japan. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Osada et al. (2007)</ref> determined reproductive status throughout the year and classified the gonad development into seven stages: I, undifferentiating; II, early differentiating; III, growing; IV, mature; V, spawning; VI, post-spawning; and VII, degenerating stages. However, the cell-cell interactions between germ and somatic cells, and the cystic structure are still unclear in this species because germ cells and gonadal somatic cells are not clearly characterized by each molecular marker gene.</p><p>To understand gonad development in this scallop, we recently analyzed immature germ cell distributions in the Yesso scallop throughout the year using vasa as a germ cell marker <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mokrina et al., 2021)</ref>. Moreover, for the gonadal somatic cells, "auxiliary cells" were previously proposed in the scallop ovary based on electron microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Dorange &amp; Le Pennec, 1989)</ref>; however, the details of cell classification are still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to identify the specific marker gene for firm identification of gonadal somatic cells in the Yesso scallop. Previous studies noted that vitellogenin <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Osada et al., 2004)</ref> and foxl2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Nagasawa et al., 2019)</ref> are expressed in the gonadal somatic cells in the Yesso scallop, but they are only expressed in female gonads, and potential markers for male somatic cells remained unclear. In this paper, we characterize a novel molecular marker that is specifically expressed in the gonadal somatic cells of the Yesso scallop. The gene designated as bone morphogenetic protein 2a (Bmp2a) is a TGFβ superfamily member. In addition, we report the spatio-temporal expression pattern of bmp2a as a gonadal somatic cell marker in the Yesso scallop. Observation of bmp2a-positive gonadal somatic cells indicated changes of the germinal acinus structure for both sexes during the reproductive phase.</p></div>

First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher, Tokyo, Japan).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Alignment and phylogenetic analysis</head><p>To survey all TGFβ superfamily members in the Yesso scallop transcriptome, the protein BLAST search (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) was conducted with the M. yessoensis transcriptome data and og-TGFβlike (ABU50369) as a query sequence. For multiple sequence alignment, the protein sequences of TGFβ superfamily members from various animals, including bivalves and teleosts, were aligned using ClustalW through the DDBJ site (https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw). Domain analysis was performed using SMART (http://smart. embl-heidelberg.de/smart/set_mode.cgi?NORMAL=1). Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with all TGFβ superfamily member sequences in the Yesso scallop and other species using PhyML (http://www. atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/). Maximum likelihood analysis was performed with bootstrap analysis (100 reactions). A phylogram was generated with the output file using a graphical viewer in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). The GenBank accession numbers of the aligned amino acid sequences are described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">RT-PCR</head><p>Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as above described. RT-PCR analysis was conducted using gene-specific primers <ref type="table">(Table S2</ref>). PCR was conducted at 95 • C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 • C, 30 s at 58 • C , and 90 s at 72 • C , followed by a final elongation step of 72 • C for 5 min. The cDNA was amplified using Ex Taq HS (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. rpl16 was used as an endogenous reference gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Feng et al., 2013)</ref>. The expression pattern was determined using two biological replicates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay for Vasa</head><p>Gonad specimens were sampled from the one-to two-year-old adult Yesso scallops (n = 5 for each sex in October, November, and December 2019, and January and February 2020, farmed in Hokkaido, Japan). The gonad tissue was sliced from the middle part of gonad, fixed with 10% formalin in ASW at 4 • C overnight, and embedded in paraffin wax. IHC was performed as described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mokrina et al., 2021)</ref>. Briefly, 6-μm thick, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were attached onto FRONTIER glass slides (Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan), boiled in HistoVT One solution (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 30 min for antigen retrieval, and immersed in 1% hydrogen peroxide in methanol solution to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Non-specific binding was blocked by incubation with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque) at RT for 30 min. Mizuhopecten yessoensis Vasa antibody was applied for primary antibody reaction (diluted 1:18000 with TBST). The primary antibody complex was detected by the ImmPRESS horse anti-rabbit IgG polymer kit peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) with the Histofine DAB substrate kit (Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) and counterstained with hematoxylin. The sections were dehydrated and mounted using Softmount (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) assay for bmp2a</head><p>The paraffine sections of gonad specimens were prepared as above described in Section 2.5. The RNAscope ISH was performed using the RNAscope 2.5 HD reagent kit BROWN (Advanced Cell Diagnostics Inc., CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-sense bmp2a probe cocktail (20ZZ probe named My-LOC110466608 targeting 2-1086 of XM_021523199.1) was designed and provided from the manufacturer (Advanced Cell Diagnostics Inc.). Concurrently, RNAscope Negative Control Probe-DapB (Advanced Cell Diagnostics Inc.) was purchased and conventionally used as an alternative of sense probe. Briefly, 6-μm thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were attached onto FRONTIER glass slides (Matsunami Glass), baked at 60 • C for 60 min, deparaffinized in 100% xylene, dehydrated in 100% ethanol, and baked again at 60 • C for 15 min. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by incubating in hydrogen peroxide at RT for 10 min. The section slides were immersed in the target retrieval buffer at exactly 98 • C for 25 min using a food steamer, permeabilized at 40 • C for 15-30 min, and hybridized with the probe cocktail at 40 • C for hrs using a HybEZ II hybridization system with EZ-batch slide system (Advanced Cell Diagnostics Inc.). The hybridized probe was amplified, visualized with the HRP/DAB system, and counterstained with hematoxylin and bluing reagent. The sections were dehydrated and mounted using Softmount (Wako Pure Chemical Industries).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Dual RNAscope ISH-IHC assay</head><p>The paraffine sections of gonad specimens were prepared as above described in Section 2.5. The dual RNAscope ISH-IHC assay, the RNAscope ISH technology in combination with IHC, was performed according to the manufacture's workflow (https://acdbio. com/science/applications/research-solutions/dual-ish-and-ihc). Firstly, the RNAscope ISH was carried out with bmp2a probe and visualized with DAB substrate as above described in Section 2.6 without counterstaining. Secondly, the IHC for Vasa was performed as above described in Section 2.5 with small modifications. Briefly, after the signal detection of RNAscope ISH, the DAB-stained sections were transferred to the IHC detection step started by boiling in HistoVT One solution (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 30 min for inactivation of the labelled HRP activity and antigen retrieval. The treatment of 1% hydrogen peroxide in methanol solution was skipped. For a dual color staining, the Vina Green chromogen kit (Biocare Medical, CA, USA) was applied for the second chromogenic reaction. The dual colorimmunostained section was counterstained with hematoxylin and bluing, dehydrated, and mounted using Softmount (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Importantly, the optimal concentration of Vasa antibody was set at higher concentration (diluted 1:6000 with TBST) than an ordinally IHC procedure with HRP/DAB system described in Section 2.5 due to a lower sensitivity of chromogenic reaction and a partial digestion of antigen by the permeabilization step during the RNAscope procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8.">Real-time qPCR analysis</head><p>Total RNA and cDNA were prepared from the gonads of one-to twoyear-old adult Yesso scallops (n = 6 for each sex in November 2018, and January and March 2019, farmed in Hokkaido, Japan). The bmp2a mRNA levels were quantified using a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System with PowerUP SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA, USA), as described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Nagasawa et al., 2019)</ref> with gene-specific primer sets <ref type="table">(Table S2</ref>, <ref type="figure">Fig. 4A</ref>). The program was initially set at 50 • C for 2 min and 95 • C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 • C, 15 s at 56 • C, and 15 s at 72 • C. Dissociation curve analysis was set at 95 • C for 15 s, 60 • C for 1 min, and 95 • C for 1 s. The cycle threshold values were set at 0.1 to define the level of arbitrary fluorescence intensity using QuantStudio Design &amp; Analysis Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Amplification efficiency (E, %) was calculated from a standard curve constructed from a diluted series of pooled cDNA samples (1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16). Four stable reference genes [40S ribosomal protein S23 (RS23), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1A), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F (EIF3F), and 60S ribosomal protein L16 (RPL16)] were chosen from previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Li et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Feng et al., 2013)</ref> and validated again with our specimens. Using geNorm software (https://genorm.cmgg.be/), the two best reference genes (RS23 and RPL16) were selected among the four genes (geNorm stability values, M, were 0.320, 0.342, 0.352, and 0.379 for RS23, rpl16, EF1A, and EIF3F, respectively) for all gonad cDNA specimens and applied to calculate normalization factors. The mRNA expression levels were calculated using the relative standard curve method with the normalization factors calculated above. For statistical analysis, Bonferroni's multiple comparison test was conducted.</p></div>

Among the 11 TGFβ candidate genes in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we numbered genes that overlapped; for example, three Bmp2s were isolated in the output and numbered (i.e., Bmp2a, Bmp2b, and Bmp2c). Multiple sequence alignment detected that all 11 TGFβ candidate genes have the seven conserved cysteine residues that are typical TGFβ-specific motifs, although Gsdf and og-TGFβ-like lacked one cysteine residue <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>. Domain analysis revealed that all 11 TGFβ candidate genes of the Yesso scallop possessed a TGFβ domain <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>, but no other conserved domain was detected. The phylogenetic tree with TGFβ superfamily members from various animals indicated that og-TGFβ-like and a couple of Bmp sequences from the Yesso scallop formed one cluster: specifically, Bmp2a and Bmp10a clustered with og-TGFβlike in a clade, whereas other scallop Bmp2s and Bmp10s were grouped in other clades <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3)</ref>. The detailed phylogram that focused on the first clade indicated that Bmp2a was much closer to og-TGFβ-like than Bmp10a ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>). Among the Bmp2s, the scallop Bmp2a was 19.7/ 52.6%, 21.8/52.7%, and 21.9/48.8% identical/similar to og-TGFβ-like, Bmp10a, and pf_Bmp2, respectively <ref type="table">(Table S3)</ref>. For the Bmp10s, the scallop Bmp10a was 20.6/45.4%, 21.3/49.7%, and 18.1/44.1% identical/similar to og-TGFβ-like, Bmp10b, dr_Bmp10, respectively <ref type="table">(Table S3</ref>).</p></div>

Simultaneously, IHC with Vasa antibody was conducted for sequential sections to detect germ cell distribution. In the dual RNAscope ISH-IHC assay <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>, Vasa protein signals were specifically detected in the immature germ cells in both testis and ovary, as described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mokrina et al., 2021)</ref>. Meanwhile, bmp2a mRNA signals did not overlap with Vasa protein signals, which indicated that the bmp2a mRNA was specifically expressed in the gonadal somatic cells of both testis and ovary during the reproductive phase <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6)</ref>. In testes, bmp2a mRNA signals were observed every month and were predominantly detected in January and February during the growing and mature stages, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6A)</ref>. Both Vasapositive germ cells and bmp2a-positive gonadal somatic cells coincidentally increased from December to February. In ovaries, bmp2a mRNA signals were detected in the gonadal somatic cells surrounding growing oocytes but not in the area around the mature oocytes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 6B)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Gonad-specific TGFβ superfamily members in molluscs</head><p>The transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) family is a structurally conserved but functionally diverse group of extracellular signaling proteins widely distributed in metazoans. Members of the TGFβ superfamily play critical roles in signaling pathways and are involved in cellular processes like cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and cellular homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Shibata et al., 2010)</ref>. Although most TGFβs show ubiquitous expression patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Lelong et al., 2000)</ref>, gsdf showed specific expression in teleost gonads <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sawatari et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Shibata et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yan et al., 2017)</ref>. Similarly, the Pacific oyster og-TGFβ-like showed specific expression in gonads <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fleury et al., 2008)</ref>. In this study, we first characterized a TGFβ member showing gonad-specific expression in the Yesso scallop. A consensus structure of TGFβ members include the seven conserved cysteine residues, which form a three-dimensional structure and dimer in the carboxy-terminal region of the mature protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kingsley, 1994)</ref>. Intriguingly, gsdf and og-TGFβ-like, which are known gonadal somatic cell-specific genes, have six conserved cysteines and lack the seventh cysteine residue <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fleury et al., 2008)</ref>. Our BLAST survey confirmed that no gsdf ortholog was found in the Yesso scallop transcriptomes, which supports that gsdf was acquired at a two rounds of whole-genome duplication event <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Forconi et al., 2013)</ref>. In contrast, the BLAST survey with og-TGFβ-like query revealed 11 TGFβ-related sequences in the Yesso scallop. Most TGFβ-related sequences in the Yesso scallop showed the seven conserved cysteine residues except for Bmp7like and Inhibin. Multiple alignment revealed that the scallop Bmp2a and Bmp10a possessed all seven conserved cysteines, which indicates similar three-dimensional structural properties between the scallop Bmps and fish Gsdf homologs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all molluscan TGFβ-related genes were distinct from the teleost gsdf clade, which indicates that there are no gsdf orthologs in molluscs. Although other Bmp2 and Bmp10 isoforms formed different clades, Bmp2a and Bmp10a were positioned in the same clade with og-TGFβ-like. This gonad-specific expression pattern of those bivalve TGFβs contrasts with the pleiotropic roles commonly ascribed to most TGFβs in a variety of physiological processes (Ten <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dijke et al., 2000)</ref>.

Tissue distribution of bmp2a and bmp10a mRNAs in an adult male Yesso scallop (1.5 years old) by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. cDNAs from peripheral organs (mouth, foot, labial palp, testis, digestive gland, kidney, mantle, and gill) were used. rpl16 was used as an endogenous reference gene because it shows stable expression among all peripheral organs, which was validated in the Yesso scallop.</p><p>revealed that Bmp2a is the closest sequence to og-TGFβ-like, followed by Bmp10a ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>, <ref type="table">Table S3</ref>). Taken together, this study first identified the gonad-specific TGFβ in the Yesso scallop following og-TGFβ-like in the Pacific oyster and indicated the indispensability of the TGFβ signaling system for bivalve gametogenesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">bmp2a mRNA expression in the gonads during the reproductive phase</head><p>In bivalves, somatic cells surrounding the germ cells have been described as "follicle cells" in the mussel <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Pipe, 1987)</ref> or "Sertoli cells" in the clams Pitar rudis and Chamelea gallina <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Erkan and Sousa, 2002)</ref>. These morphological observations support a close interaction between gonadal somatic and germ cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Erkan and Sousa, 2002)</ref>. This study identified a couple of bmps (i.e., bmp2a and bmp10a) as gonad-specific TGFβ. However, the mRNA localization remained unclear because the general ISH method was not able to detect both bmp mRNA signals. Remarkably, we newly applied RNAscope technology, an extremely sensitive ISH method, and successfully observed the bmp2a mRNA expression for the first time in the gonadal somatic cells, although bmp10a expression has yet to be further analyzed. Our observation found that bmp2a mRNA signals were consistently detected in the gonadal somatic cells but not in the germ cells that expressed Vasa in both testes and ovaries during the reproductive phase. Indeed, the bmp2a-expressing cells were positioned in the interstitial space between the germ cells. These observations clearly indicate that bmp2a can be used as a marker gene of gonadal somatic cells in the Yesso scallop. In testis, the bmp2a-expressing cells were dominated from the growing (January) to mature stages (February), whereas no bmp2a-expressing cells were seen in the area that consists of spermatids and sperm at the mature stage (February). The results demonstrated that bmp2a-positive somatic cells are closely associated with spermatogonia and spermatocytes to support germ cell differentiation in testis. In ovaries, the bmp2aexpressing cells were mainly observed at the oocyte growing phase (December-February). Specifically, the bmp2a mRNA was detected in the somatic cells around the growing oocytes but not in the mature oocytes. The observations for both sexes indicated that the bmp2a-positive cells may correspond to the Sertoli-like cells in testis or follicle-like cells in ovary in the Yesso scallop. It is important to note that the shifts of bmp2a mRNA signals at different maturational stages were identical to the mRNA quantification results by qPCR analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Putative roles of BMP2a in gonad development in the scallop</head><p>The qPCR analysis revealed seasonal changes of bmp2a mRNA expression level in gonads at different maturational stages. The bmp2a mRNA level was relatively low at the immature stage (November) in both testis and ovary. The bmp2a mRNA level increased at the mature stage (January) and remained high until after spawning (May) in both gonads. The involvement of TGFβ in germ cell maintenance has been reported in the rainbow trout Gsdf <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Sawatari et al., 2007)</ref> and Pacific oyster og-TGFβ-like <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Huvet et al., 2012)</ref>, which function as activators of germ cell proliferation and are involved differentiation into the meiotic germ cells. Our qPCR results propose that the scallop Bmp2a supports germ cell proliferation and maturation processes for spermatogonia/ spermatocytes or primary/growing oocytes. Functional analysis using gene knockdown or knockout experiments is required to better understand the scallop Bmp2a function in gametogenesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Structure of germinal acinus with gonadal somatic cells in the scallop</head><p>This study successfully visualized gonadal somatic cells and mitotic germ cells using a specific molecular marker individually in the Yesso scallop. Therefore, we proposed the basic structure of germinal acinus of the Yesso scallop <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 8)</ref>. Briefly, somatic and germ cells form a lobule structure. Germ cell differentiation is generally synchronized in the germinal acinus (lobule) in both mitotic and meiotic phases, similar to fish gonads <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Schulz et al., 2010)</ref>, whereas no obvious cystic structure encircled with somatic cells was identified in the scallop gonads. In the scallop testis, mitotic gem cells (i.e., spermatogonia) proliferate on the basal membrane of the lobule lumen in the growing stage (October). Then, spermatogenesis progresses toward the center of the germinal acinus, similar to mammalian testis structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Schulz et al., 2010</ref>). The <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Localization of bmp2a mRNA and Vasa protein in the adult Yesso scallop gonads by using dual RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The testes at undifferentiating stage (October), at early differentiating stage (November), and ovary at mature stage (January) were subjected to the analysis. Sequential sections were prepared for the dual ISH-IHC (left panels, A-C) or HE staining (right panels, D-F). High-magnification images (a-f) were captured from the area outlined by dashed line (A-F). In the dual ISH-IHC, bmp2a mRNA (brown) and my-Vasa protein (green) are detected in somatic cells and germ cells, respectively. Insets indicate that no signal is observed with the RNAscope negative control probe-DapB. The bars represent 50 µm. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) bmp2a-positive gonadal somatic cells contact spermatogonia and spermatocytes, but they have no such contact with spermatids and sperm at the mature stage (February). Our results showed that bmp2a-positive somatic cells are distributed like mammalian Sertoli cells that contact and support the various germ cell types. In the scallop ovary, oocytes synchronously grow in the germinal acinus during the growing (October) and mature stages (February), whereas the bmp2a-positive somatic cells consistently attach to the growing oocytes until completion of oocyte maturation. These observations demonstrated that the germinal acinus structure of the Yesso scallop is similar to the mammalian testis structure in terms of gonadal somatic cell distribution with possible regulatory functions in germ cell support, as in mammals.</p></div>

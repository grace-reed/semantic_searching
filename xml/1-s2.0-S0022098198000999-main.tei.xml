			<abstract>
				<p>High concentrations of fine suspended particulate matter (SPM) on nearshore coral reefs are generally assumed to be a stress factor for corals. However, the extent to which SPM serves as a food source for corals has not been quantified. Using C-labelled natural particulate matter, this study investigates the relationship between concentration and suspension feeding on fine SPM by four common species of Scleractinian coral on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. In ingestion trials, only one species (Porites cylindrica Dana) conformed to traditional saturationkinetic models (Michaelis-Menten, Hollings type I) with ingestion rates reaching maximum at low to moderate SPM concentrations (4-8 mg l). For the remaining three species (Pocillopora damicornis Linnaeus, Montipora digitata Dana and Acropora millepora Ehrenberg) ingestion 21 rates increased linearly over the full range of SPM concentrations (1-30 mg l). All study species assimilated a major proportion of the ingested label, but assimilation efficiency was inversely related to SPM concentration. At low concentrations (1 mg l), estimates of assimilation efficiency ranged from 89 to 95% of the ingested SPM, decreasing to 40-50% at the highest concentrations (30 mg SPM l). The maximum rate of SPM carbon assimilation can cover less than 5% of basic metabolic costs, which is not significantly different from reported contributions of zooplankton feeding to coral energy budgets. More importantly, SPM feeding at high particle concentrations may cover up to half of the carbon and a third of the nitrogen required for tissue growth.</p>

On coral reefs, SPM constitutes a diverse food source derived from a variety of sources including detrital matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Marshall, 1965)</ref>, resuspended sediment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Larcombe et al., 1995)</ref>, coral mucus <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Coffroth, 1990)</ref> and excretory products from other animals (e.g., from fish, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Meyer and Schultz, 1985)</ref>. In addition, such particles are subject to colonisation by bacteria and microalgae, which increases the organic value of this food package <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Riley, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wotton, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Although hermatypic corals gain the majority of their carbon requirement through their symbiotic association with unicellular algae (zooxanthellae, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Falkowski et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Muscatine, 1990)</ref>, they are also passive suspension feeders with the potential for utilising a range of food sources (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sebens, 1987)</ref>. Corals on nearshore reefs in the GBR lagoon often experience high concentrations of fine SPM for extended periods of time (up to 20 mg l , <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Larcombe et al., 1995)</ref> which raises the hypothesis that SPM is a potentially more important food source in nearshore habitats than in oligotrophic (offshore) environments. Although heterotrophy has been recognised as an important function of hermatypic scleractinian corals for half a century (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Yonge, 1930)</ref>, no studies have quantified the importance of SPM for corals. In a recent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mills and Sebens (1997)</ref> showed that corals ingest large particles (Artemia cysts) settled on their tissues. The organic content of bedload particles, however, may be less than 0.3% on coral reefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Johnstone et al., 1990)</ref>, whereas that of fine suspended particles is typically above 3% (M. Dommisse, pers. comm.).</p><p>Numerous early studies documented the ability of hermatypic corals to capture and ingest various sources of particulate food, including zooplankton, phytoplankton and bacteria (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Muscatine, 1973)</ref>. Only a few studies, however, have tested the capacity of corals to utilise SPM (as defined above) as a food source, despite its abundance in many nearshore waters. Attempts to quantify feeding on SPM by corals have mainly used artificial food substrates, including colloidal graphite <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lewis, 1977)</ref>, plastic beads <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clayton and Lasker, 1982)</ref>, and Artemia cysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clayton and Lasker, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sebens and Johnson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Helmuth and Sebens, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Johnson and Sebens, 1993)</ref> which have little resemblance to natural SPM. Important shortfalls in most early studies on suspension feeding in corals (or by suspension feeders in general) are that the experimental flow regime and particle concentration were often not characterised. Both parameters govern the rate of delivery to the feeding structures of passive suspension feeders (particle flux, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Shimeta and Jumars, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abelson et al., 1993)</ref>. Recent studies on suspension feeding have focused on hydro-mechanical aspects of particle capture (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Helmuth and Sebens, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sebens et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shimeta and Koehl, 1997)</ref> rather than on the energetic importance of particle capture. Due to this variation in objectives and experimental protocols among previous studies, the energetic importance of suspension feeding on particulate matter, especially for corals, is still uncertain.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to quantify particulate feeding for four species of hermatypic, Scleractinian coral as functions of SPM concentrations typical of those found across the GBR lagoon. Specifically, I test whether ingestion as a function of SPM concentration for these species conform to traditional models of functional responses (rectilinear: type 1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Holling, 1959</ref><ref type="bibr">curvilinear: e.g., Michaelis-Menten, Parsons et al., 1984</ref> to be able to identify what particle loads cause feeding saturation. Furthermore, I estimate what proportion of the ingested material is assimilated by corals at different SPM concentrations to assess the energetic importance of particulate matter as a food source for corals in different turbidity regimes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Selection of coral species</head><p>Four coral species from three families commonly dominating coral assemblages in the GBR region were chosen for this study: Pocillopora damicornis, Montipora digitata, Acropora millepora and Porites cylindrica. The choice of coral species was mainly based on two morphological and behavioural properties. Firstly, all species have a digitate to branching growth form and comparable polyp sizes (1-2 mm diameter, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.  1</ref>) which minimise potential effects of geometry on local flow patterns and thus flux of particles and rate of encounter with tentacles <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Eckman and Nowell, 1984)</ref>. The use of branching rather than massive growth forms ensures that suspension feeding rather than gravitational deposition is quantified <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abelson et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Johnson and Sebens, 1993)</ref>. Secondly, all species generally have their polyps extended during both day and night, which allows a direct comparison of diel SPM consumption among species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Collecting and maintenance of corals</head><p>All corals were collected from fringing reefs in Pioneer Bay and Cattle Bay on the inshore side of Orpheus Island in the central region of the GBR. Turbidity regimes in 21 these areas range from 1-8 mg suspended particulate matter (SPM) l . Montipora digitata is an intertidal species <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Veron, 1986)</ref> and was collected from less than one meter depth below datum. All other species were collected from a narrow subtidal depth range (3-4 m below datum) to minimise potential differences in heterotrophic capacity which could arise through differences in feeding strategies in different light regimes. Coral samples consisted of 4-6 cm long terminal branches, cut from the colony with bone cutters. Only one branch was sampled per coral colony, and only widely spaced colonies were sampled to maximise the number of clones in the analysis. Each branch was mounted on a stand consisting of a PVC cup (16 mm high 16 mm wide) with a vertical stalk for attachment to racks and to the bottom of flow tanks <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The base of each branch was embedded in non-toxic wax to keep the coral firmly attached to its stand, and all mounted branches were placed on racks and transported while submerged to holding tanks with running seawater. Corals were held in the tanks for a maximum of one week prior to experimentation to avoid stress from prolonged exposure to laboratory conditions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Collecting and labelling of SPM</head><p>To provide a suspension of particulate matter which closely resembles that experienced by corals in situ, all experiments used natural SPM collected by filtration of seawater (10 mm) pumped from 3-5 meter depth, immediately above the reef crest in Pioneer Bay, Orpheus Island. Particulate matter resulting from 24 h of filtration was resuspended in 10 l of seawater and strained through a 100 mm mesh to remove large zooplankters. A 1-l subsample was taken from the suspension and used to determine the 21 weight-specific concentration ( | 300 mg dry weight l ), and the remainder (8 l) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">14</ref> incubated with C in a 20-l transparent carboy.

After labelling, the suspension was centrifuged twice for 10 min at 3500 rpm, divided into 4-ml portions, and stored in the freezer (2708C) until used. By subsampling from a frozen stock suspension rather than preparing new stocks prior to incubation, identical substrates were used in all feeding trials and consisted of dead particulate matter with minimum microbial activity during incubations. Results of pilot studies showed that material from frozen aliquots is ingested by corals as readily as live material <ref type="bibr">(Anthony, unpublished)</ref>.</p><p>To standardise feeding to mg SPM, the radioactivity (dpm) per ml labelled SPM stock suspension was determined for five randomly chosen samples.

Volume-4 21 specific activity of the SPM stock was 1.5 ? 10 (6S.E. 1.0 ? 10 ) dpm ml . Five 1-ml aliquots from the labelled stock suspension were filtered (0.7 mm) through Whatman GF / F filters, and dried for 72 h at 558C to obtain weight-specific concentration, which was 1.9 (6S.E. 0.1) mg dry SPM ml . Weight-specific radioactivity of the labelled SPM stock was thus 750 dpm (mg SPM) and was used to convert dpm data to mg SPM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Experimental design</head><p>Experiments were divided into: (1) a 1-h feeding phase followed by (2) an assimilation phase in which half of the fed coral population was allowed to digest and assimilate the ingested ration as well as egest unincorporated label.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Feeding experiments</head><p>All feeding trials were run using four 2-l acrylic incubation chambers constructed as mini-flumes (30 cm long 8 cm wide 3 8 cm high) in which a constant, unidirectional flux of SPM was established ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A</ref>). The flow in each flume was generated by a propeller driven by a 24 V DC motor (Electro Craft, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with a solid state speed control. One motor was driving the propellers of all four chambers through a series of belts and pulleys to assure similar flow speeds in all tanks. A mean 21 unidirectional flow speed of 5-7 cm s was used in all incubations, typical for the flow regime at 3-5 m depth in the wind-protected Pioneer and Cattle Bays. Furthermore, the flow was smoothed by flow straighteners in the upstream end of each chamber. Two 6-mm diameter holes in the floor of the chamber in the working section (20 cm downstream) functioned as attachments for the coral stands ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A</ref>).</p><p>All feeding trials were run at night and in darkness to minimise uptake of CO 2 through photosynthesis of zooxanthellae. Corals were allowed to adjust to chamber conditions for 2-4 h prior to the experiments, during which period the chambers received a constant flow of seawater directly from the reef. The feeding phase was initiated when the polyps of all corals were fully extended, typically at 20:00 h. 14 Immediately prior to a feeding trial, the C-labelled SPM suspension was rinsed three times by centrifugation (3500 rpm for 10 min) to minimise dissolved organic label and added to each chamber through the injection port. Although, rinsing and centrifugation is likely to cause loss of labelled surface bacteria and organic films, the weight-specific radioactivity of the experimental SPM did not vary from that of the stock samples determined by filtration [750 dpm (mg SPM) , see above].</p><p>After 60-min of incubation, one coral was removed from the each chamber, briefly submerged in seawater to remove uningested adhering label, and cut from its base directly into a 20-ml glass scintillation vial with 2 ml tissue solubiliser (Soluene-350, Packard). The samples were incubated at 558C until all tissues were digested (48-72 h), and bleached in 200 ml H O to reduce colour quenching. Ten ml scintillation fluid 2 2 (Hionic Flour, Packard) was added to each sample and left for 24 h to allow solubilised tissue inside the skeleton to become extracted. Each piece of skeleton was transferred to an empty vial, washed, dried, and analysed for surface area (see Section 2.7). Less than 2% of the sample radioactivity was lost when removing the coral skeleton from the scintillation vial.</p><p>Ingestion of particulate matter was determined from the amount of radioactivity in coral tissues, controlled for uptake of dissolved organic label evolving during incuba-tions. Uptake of dissolved label was determined from the tissue-radioactivity of corals incubated in filtered (0.45 mm) water to which a labelled filtrate (0.2 mm) was added. This method was preferred over using corals with contracted polyps (non-feeding) as controls, since the latter have a reduced surface for uptake of dissolved matter and thereby produce underestimates of dissolved uptake by feeding corals. The amount of dissolved label added to these control chambers was based on the mean concentration of dissolved label during control runs without corals (sets of four chambers) using two different SPM concentrations (1 and 30 mg l ). To quantify this evolution of dissolved 14 C, four 2-ml water samples were taken at t 5 1, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min, filtered 0.2 mm through 13 mm Nucleopore membranes, fixed in 1% formalin to prevent microbial activity and consequent loss of CO , and determined for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Based on this assay, control corals were incubated in water with a concentration of dissolved C corresponding to 15% of the mean concentration of particulate C <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Assimilation of SPM</head><p>The second coral branch from each feeding chamber was transferred to a smaller chamber ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2B</ref>) with a flow-through of filtered (1 mm) unlabelled seawater in which the coral was allowed to digest and assimilate the ingested particulate matter, and egest any unincorporated material. The duration of this phase was kept at 24 h, as pilot studies showed that . 95% of ingested, indigestible markers (6-mm latex beads) are egested within this time frame (Anthony, unpublished data). The assimilation phase was typically initiated at 21:00, and the corals were exposed to a natural light regime corresponding to 5 m depth during the following day to allow natural metabolism.</p><p>Respiratory loss of CO from the corals during the assimilation phase was determined using a technique modified from that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Crosby et al. (1989)</ref>. The filtered water from each egestion chamber was collected in 25-l carboys with formalin (1% final solution) to prevent the evolution of CO from microbial activity. Air displaced from each carboy while filling was bubbled through a series of four 25-ml sealed centrifuge vials with 10 ml 2 M NaOH which functioned as CO traps. At conclusion of the assimilation 2 phase, 100 ml of 1 M citric acid was injecting into the carboys (pH 1-2) to stimulate release of CO from solution, and the water was ventilated with N for 48 h. A 2-ml 2 subsample from each vial in the CO traps was added to 10 ml StarScint (Packard) and determined for radioactivity by scintillation counting. The decline in radioactivity over the series of vials provided an effective means of monitoring a high efficiency ( | 98% <ref type="formula">)   14</ref>of CO retention by the traps. After completion of the assimilation phase, each coral fragment was cut from its base and treated as described for the feeding phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Normalisation of ingestion data</head><p>2 Feeding data were standardised to mg SPM ingested per cm colony surface area per h. For Montipora digitata, Acropora millepora and Porites cylindrica, colony surface area was calculated based on the simple geometrical shapes and dimensions of coral branches. For Pocillopora damicornis, which has a more irregular surface, total number of corallites (polyps) were counted and converted to surface area from the number of corallites per cm (676S.E. 5 for N 5 10 9-mm quadrats).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Feeding responses to concentrations of suspended particulate matter</head><p>All four species demonstrated a capacity to feed on fine SPM, and rates of ingestion increased markedly with increasing particle concentration for all species <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>. However, ingestion rates were relatively low for all species, with maxima of less than 5 mg SPM per square cm coral surface area per hour. For three of the four species, rate of ingestion increased five-to ten-fold as a function of SPM concentrations between and 21 30 mg l . These three species (Pocillopora damicornis, Montipora digitata and 2 Acropora millepora) showed simple linear feeding responses (R from 0.82 to 0.96) over the wide range of SPM concentrations. P. damicornis showed a tendency to become saturated at high SPM concentrations as indicated by a significant fit to both the piecewise linear and curvilinear models, as well as to the simple linear model <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 1)</ref>. However, estimates of the saturation (C , Hollings type 1) and half-saturation (K, saturation Michaelis-Menten) constants for P. damicornis were located in the upper range of the SPM concentrations used (20 and 28 mg l , respectively), which renders the non-linear models inappropriate for the feeding response of P. damicornis within this range of concentrations (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Currie, 1982)</ref>. Only Porites cylindrica showed convincing saturation as the feeding rate did not increase significantly over the concentration range 4-30 mg l . The feeding response of P. cylindrica could be explained equally well by l , approximately an order of magnitude lower than that estimated for P. damicornis (27.562.0). Of the three linear feeding responses, ingestion rates of P. damicornis and M. digitata were generally higher compared to that of A. millepora as indicated by the results of the ANCOVA <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2)</ref>. Interestingly, the slopes of the linear feeding responses for P. damicornis, M. digitata and A. millepora were almost identical (0.12-0.136S.E. 0.01, F 50.85, p50.43, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>). Below the level of saturation, the slope of the feeding 2,71 response for P. cylindrica (0.29) was three-fold those of the three simple linear responses, suggesting that feeding of this species at low SPM concentrations is more directly related to particle availability than for the other species.</p><p>Based on the control incubations, approximately 25% of the radioactivity in coral tissues after the feeding phase could be attributed to uptake of dissolved C. This ratio of dissolved to particulate uptake remained constant (2663%) across species and between lowest and highest SPM concentrations used. A factor of 0.75 was thus used to correct all ingestion data for uptake of dissolved label. Interestingly, only a maximum of 15% of the total label (at t545 and 60 min) was in dissolved form ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref>), suggesting that dissolved label is more readily taken up than particulates.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Ingestion rate as a function of particle concentration</head><p>All four species demonstrated a capacity to feed on fine suspended particulate matter, a capacity that was positively correlated with particle availability as hypothesised in this study. Surprisingly, the relationship between particle concentration and rate of ingestion was a simple linear function of concentration rather than a traditional saturation curve for three out of the four species (P. damicornis, M. digitata and A. millepora). Even particle concentrations mimicking observed peak turbidity regimes in some nearshore coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon (16 and 30 mg l ), did not cause significantly lower rates of ingestion than expected from the linear model. Interestingly, since particle concentrations at the study sites rarely exceed 8 mg l , maximum experimental concentrations were at least three times higher than those normally experienced by these corals. Only P. cylindrica conformed convincingly to traditional saturation-kinetic models by reaching maximum rate of ingestion at low-to-moderate particle concentrations (4-8 mg l ). P. damicornis showed a tendency to become saturated at concentrations .16 mg l , and would most likely saturate at lower concentrations than both M. digitata and A. millepora over a broader range of concentrations. However, constructing feeding response curves based on higher particle concentrations would not reflect the conditions under which these species naturally feed.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rigler (1961)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Holling (1959)</ref>, a rectilinear functional response is expected for filter feeders, i.e., feeding rate is a linear function of prey concentration until it reaches a plateau. For three of the four species (P. damicornis, M. digitata and A. millepora) such a plateau was not reached within the range of particle concentrations used in this study. The feeding responses for P. cylindrica, however, was equally well modelled by the rectilinear (Hollings type I) and curvilinear (Michaelis-Menten) relationships. Tentatively, feeding by coral polyps can be modelled analogous to active sites in enzyme kinetics, showing increasing levels of saturation with increasing substrate concentration (curvilinear response) rather than a linear increase up to a certain plateau (rectilinear response). Theoretical models of shapes of feeding responses for filter feeders also predict curvilinear rather than rectilinear responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lehman, 1976)</ref>. For passive suspension feeders the shape of the feeding response curve is likely to be governed by both morphological, physiological and behavioural characteristics of the organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hart and Latta, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Leonard, 1989)</ref>. However, an explanation as to why only P. cylindrica showed saturation is not apparent from the results of this study, yet a number of hypotheses appear plausible. Firstly, a lower tentacle cleaning rate as determined by the velocity of ciliary feeding currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Muscatine, 1973)</ref> may be a limiting factor at high particle concentrations. The low cleaning rate of the congeneric Porites lutea in sediment-rejection experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Stafford-Smith, 1993</ref>) adds support to this hypothesis. Secondly, space-limitations of polyp coelenterons may define a limit to ingestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lehman, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Taghon and Jumars, 1984)</ref> and will be relatively more important for small-polyped species such as P. cylindrica and M. digitata. For example, 21 the maximum SPM ingestion rate for P. cylindrica of 2 mg (cm colony surface) h 21 21</p><p>( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5)</ref> corresponds to a volumetric intake of 2 ml (cm colony surface) h , assuming neutral buoyancy and disregarding effects of hydration on particle volume.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>Since P. cylindrica carries approximately 65 polyps per cm colony surface <ref type="bibr">(Anthony, unpublished)</ref>, each polyp would ingest a volume of the order 0.03 ml which corresponds to one spherical particle of 400 mm diameter per hour. Thirdly, high particle concentrations may elicit a stress response and stimulate the coral to stop feeding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21</head><p>However, the tentacles of all corals exposed to maximum particle loads (30 mg l ) remained expanded during the full length of the incubations suggesting that the feeding behaviour of the corals was not adversely affected by high particle concentrations. Fourthly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lewis and Price (1975)</ref> noted for Atlantic corals that poritids and pocilloporids only employed tentacular feeding whereas acroporids showed both tentacular and mucus feeding. Whether such differences in feeding behaviours and mechanisms are responsible for the different kinetics observed in, for example P. cylindrica and A. millepora, is unclear and deserves further study.</p><p>Based on absolute values of the maximum feeding rates in this study (less than 5 mg 2 per cm per h), all four coral species showed low affinity for fine particulate matter, which would tend to prevent feeding saturation. Furthermore, only 1-h incubations were used in this study (to minimise the build-up and uptake of dissolved label) which may be insufficient time to accumulate enough material to cause saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Patterson, 1991)</ref>. Periods of high turbidity over reefs are often of the scale of days to weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Larcombe et al., 1995)</ref> rather than of hours. A common slope (DI /DC) for the three linear responses of 0.12 to 0.13 (60.01, S.E.) indicates that the successful capture and ingestion of fine particles by P. damicornis, M. digitata and A. millepora increases only one-fold for every eight-fold increase in food availability. In the absence of saturation and other factors inhibiting capture and ingestion, the expected increment in feeding rate per increment in food concentration would be closer to unity for passive suspension feeders, given that potential particle capture is directly related to particle flux. For example, the expected slopes of prey capture rate to abundance for Madracis mirabilis (a small-polyped species, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sebens et al., 1996)</ref> and P. damicornis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clayton and Lasker, 1982)</ref> in zooplankton feeding experiments were in the order of 0.5. The generally low feeding rates and low slope observed in this study may be related to the small particle size as suggested by aerosol-filtration theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rubenstein and Koehl, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Shimeta and Jumars, 1991)</ref>. The spacing between tentacle tips for the coral species used in this study was of the order 500-2000 mm whereas the range of particle sizes was 10-100 mm, thereby excluding sieving as a likely mode of capture for corals feeding on fine SPM. Sieving is suggested to be an important mechanism in the capture of zooplankton for both octocorals <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sebens and Koehl, 1984)</ref> and scleractinian corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sebens et al., 1996)</ref>. For particles with diameters only 1 / 20 to 1 / 5 of the spacings between coral tentacles, and at flow velocities typical 21 of lagoonal coral reefs (5-10 cm s ) the predominant mode of capture is most likely direct interception, i.e., the particle follows a streamline that brings it within one particle radius of a tentacle <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Rubenstein and Koehl, 1977)</ref>. In order for such small particles to be intercepted by a tentacle they must travel in streamlines closer to the tentacles than large particles, and thus have a lower probability of capture than larger particles of similar abundance. For spionid polychaetes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shimeta and Koehl (1997)</ref> found that the probability of encounter increased as the square of the particle diameter, corresponding to an almost 100-fold increase in capture probability with an increase in particle size from 10 to 100 mm.</p><p>Only coral species with a branching / digitate growth form and small polyps were used in this study, as this morphology is expected to facilitate higher capture rate of small prey items than that of massive large-polyped species, in part due to a larger area of contact (projected tentacle surface) with the flowing water. According to the model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abelson et al. (1993)</ref>, coral species with a high ratio of body height to basal width encounter high fluxes of small suspended particles, whereas massive and encrusting forms encounter fluxes of predominantly heavier, resuspended material. Also, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sebens et al. (1996)</ref> found that Madracia mirabilis (small polyps, branching) captured .36-times more plankton per unit of biomass than Montastrea cavernosa (large polyps, massive). The use of individual coral branches rather than whole colonies in this study, however, may overestimate in situ feeding rates due to partial depletion of the water by polyps upstream, especially in large clones <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anthony, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sebens et al., 1997)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Feeding responses as a proxy of tolerance to turbidity regimes</head><p>The low saturation constant (C or K) of P. cylindrica in contrast to the absence saturation of saturation for the other three species may suggest that P. cylindrica performs poorly in high-turbidity habitats. Moreover, it raises the hypothesis that the suitability of a high-turbidity regime for a given coral species may be indicated by the saturation characteristics (parameters C or K) of that species. However, the relative saturation abundances of the four study species in habitats of different turbidity levels along an inshore-offshore transect across the Great Barrier Reef lagoon <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Done, 1982)</ref>, does not add convincing support to this hypothesis. For example, P. damicornis is abundant in most coral reef habitats across the GBR lagoon from extreme inshore to exposed offshore reefs. Although M. digitata (the best SPM feeder) is often the dominant coral species on shallow mudflats where it is periodically exposed to extremely turbid conditions, P. cylindrica (the poorest SPM feeder) also prospers in extremely turbid habitats (D. <ref type="bibr">Barnes, pers comm.)</ref>. Nevertheless, complete saturation of SPM feeding in P. cylindrica at concentrations as low as 2-4 mg l renders this species a poor heterotroph in high-turbidity regimes and supports previous assumptions that members of the genus Porites rely mainly on autotrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Johannes and Tepley, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Edmunds and Spencer-Davies, 1989)</ref>. Saturation parameters of feeding response curves may therefore not serve as a useful proxy for detecting tolerance levels of corals to high particle loads, but provides a useful tool for estimating the capacity of a species to utilise the particle availability in a given turbidity regime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Effects of SPM concentration on estimates of assimilation efficiency</head><p>The estimates of assimilation efficiency were high for all species. At low particle concentrations, almost the total consumption of particulate matter was assimilated (mean 94%), and an average of 64% of the ingested matter was utilised at the highest SPM 21 concentration (30 mg l ). This inverse relationship between AE and rate of ingestion corroborates the pattern for other marine invertebrates <ref type="bibr">(Zamer, 1986 and references therein)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sorokin (1973)</ref> also reported high rates of assimilation for corals feeding on planktonic bacteria (and lower rates for phytoplankton) but data are, however, not readily comparable to this study mainly due to different methods of standardisation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Zamer (1986)</ref> found that the temperate symbiotic sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima assimilated between 68% and 95% of the ingested carbon (based on gravimetric methods), not significantly different from the results of this study.</p><p>Assimilation efficiency as estimated in this study, however, must be interpreted with caution due to shortfalls of the labelling method, since only the live portion of the organic fraction (mainly bacteria and microalgae) was labelled with C. Although this labelling method is satisfactory to provide a marker for ingestion, assuming that the label is homogenously distributed among particles, it will almost certainly overestimate assimilation efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lopez et al., 1989)</ref>. Since most suspension and deposit feeders will readily digest and assimilate the live organic coating and reject / egest the less labelled refractory matrix (see review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wotton, 1994)</ref>, assimilation will reflect the utilisation of the more intensely labelled live organic matter rather than the whole particles. Notwithstanding this source of error, the community of microorganisms coating the fine particles (which are targeted in the labelling process) presumably constitute the most nutritionally important component of suspended particulate matter. The results of this study demonstrate that the major proportion of this organic component is utilised by suspension feeding corals, even at the highest concentration used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Importance of fine SPM as a food source for corals</head><p>The maximum feeding rates on fine SPM observed in this study [5 mg SPM (cm 21 21 colony surface area) h ] are low compared with data on suspension feeding by corals in other studies. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Clayton and Lasker (1982)</ref> found that in concentrations corresponding to 30 mg dry weight of Artemia nauplii l , P. damicornis ingested 2 approximately 40 mg nauplii per cm colony surface per h (based on a polyp density of per cm , this study). This value is approximately eight times the feeding rate found in this study. However, the feeding rates of P. damicornis as found by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Clayton and Lasker (1982)</ref> are not readily comparable to those in this study due to differences in experimental protocol and types of food. The mean size of Artemia nauplii is 600 mm compared to a particle size range of 10-100 mm in this study, resulting in a several-fold higher capture probability of nauplii due to size per se, and even more so if capture of nauplii is aided by sieving (see above) and gravitational deposition.</p><p>Relative to daily respiratory and photosynthetic carbon fluxes, the contribution of carbon from SPM appears to be insignificant. For example, using an organic carbon content of 5% for fine SPM in the study area (M. Dommisse, pers. comm.) and an assimilation efficiency of 79% <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6)</ref> (cm surface area) d at the highest particle concentration (30 mg l ). For comparison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Muscatine et al. (1984)</ref> reported rates of respiration and gross photo-21 21 synthesis in Stylophora pistilata of 125 and 138 mg C (cm surface area) d , respectively. Despite a small contribution to daily energy budgets, feeding on SPM may, however, be important for coral growth. It is well documented that most of the carbon translocated from zooxanthellae is lost as respiration or excretion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Spencer-Davies, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Falkowski et al., 1984)</ref>, in part due to low contents of N and P necessary for tissue synthesis. Assuming a 1 to 5% daily increase in tissue mass in P. damicornis (Spencer-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Davies, 1991)</ref> and an animal carbon content of 0.94 mg per cm surface area <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Muller-Parker et al., 1994)</ref>, the carbon-specific growth rate of this species ranges from 9 to 46 mg C per cm per day (24 h). At high particle concentrations (30 mg l ), the daily assimilation of 4.75 mg organic carbon per cm from SPM can thus potentially account for 10-52% of the growth needs in P. damicornis. The low respiratory loss of C assimilated from SPM (13-34%, <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>) supports the hypothesis that a large proportion of the heterotrophic carbon is channelled into growth. Applying similar calculations and assumptions to assimilation of nitrogen suggests that particle feeding can account for 7-33% of the tissue growth, given an organic C:N ratio of 6.4 for coral animal tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Muller-Parker et al., 1994)</ref> and 10 for fine SPM <ref type="bibr">(Anthony, unpublished)</ref>.</p><p>Several studies have addressed the hypothesis that coral-algae associations may be nutrient limited and depend on an external supply of nutrients in either dissolved or particulate form (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Falkowski et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Spencer-Davies, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atkinson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Stambler and Dubinsky, 1992)</ref>. Based on a mass-balance estimate for Acropora palmata, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bythell (1988)</ref> suggested that 70% of the required nitrogen intake came from particulate feeding. Fine SPM provides a large surface area for colonisation by microorganisms and hence a coating with organic nutrients <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Wotton, 1994)</ref>. Concentrations of macronutrients (N and P) bound up with fine SPM in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon are almost two orders of magnitude higher than concentrations of dissolved macronutrients (M. Dommisse, pers. comm.), rendering fine SPM a potentially important vehicle for nutrient delivery to corals, even at low rates of consumption.</p><p>The results of this study support previous suggestions that suspended particulate matter occurring over lagoonal or inshore reefs may be an important food source for corals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Goreau et al., 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lewis, 1977)</ref>, even relative to other food sources. Daily intakes of SPM in this study are not significantly different from estimated feeding rates on zooplankton feeding by Scleractinian corals in situ. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Porter (1974)</ref> found that zooplankton feeding by Montastrea cavernosa could account for only between 0.2 and 11% of the coral's daily energy requirements. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Johannes et al. (1970)</ref> estimated that the availability of zooplankton in coral-reef waters is sufficient to cover only 5.4% of the coral's dark respiration. Due to a high content of nitrogen and phosphorus in zooplankton <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Corner and Davies, 1971)</ref>, however, this food source is likely to be more efficient than SPM in delivering nutrients to corals. Nevertheless, contrary to nocturnal zooplanktivores, the polyps of species such as P. damicornis, M. digitata, A. millepora and P. cylindrica are also expanded during the day, and thus have the potential for sustaining their heterotrophy full time. Furthermore, concentrations of fine SPM on inshore reefs do not show the diel patterns characteristic of zooplankton <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Porter, 1974)</ref> and may stay high for extended periods of time, maintained mostly by wind and swell <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Larcombe et al., 1995)</ref>. P. damicornis, M. digitata and A. millepora, which all ingest SPM as a linear function of concentration, may thus have higher daily heterotrophic intakes than nocturnal zooplanktivores in lagoonal, high-turbidity habitats.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Morphology of the four study species.

			<abstract>
				<p>The green alga Ostreobium is an important coral holobiont member, playing key roles in skeletal decalcification and providing photosynthate to bleached corals that have lost their dinoflagellate endosymbionts. Ostreobium lives in the coral&apos;s skeleton, a low-light environment with variable pH and O availability. We present the Ostreobium nuclear genome and a metatranscriptomic analysis of healthy and bleached corals to improve our understanding of Ostreobium&apos;s adaptations to its extreme environment and its roles as a coral holobiont member. The Ostreobium genome has 10,663 predicted protein-coding genes and shows adaptations for life in low and variable light conditions and other stressors in the endolithic environment. This alga presents a rich repertoire of light-harvesting complex proteins but lacks many genes for photoprotection and photoreceptors. It also has a large arsenal of genes for oxidative stress response. An expansion of extracellular peptidases suggests that Ostreobium may supplement its energy needs by feeding on the organic skeletal matrix, and a diverse set of fermentation pathways allow it to live in the anoxic skeleton at night. Ostreobium depends on other holobiont members for vitamin B12, and our metatranscriptomes identify potential bacterial sources. Metatranscriptomes showed Ostreobium becoming a dominant agent of photosynthesis in bleached corals and provided evidence for variable responses among coral samples and different Ostreobium genotypes. Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the adaptations of Ostreobium to its extreme environment and an important genomic resource to improve our comprehension of coral holobiont resilience, bleaching and recovery.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Coral health depends on the harmonious association between the coral animal and its microbial associates, together known as the holobiont. A wealth of studies shows that climate change threatens coral health by disrupting the association between the coral and its photosynthetic dinoflagellate endosymbionts (Symbiodiniaceae), culminating in coral bleaching and death. The role of other microbes in coral resilience is just starting to be understood, and our current knowledge is largely based on correlations between coral health status and the presence of microbial taxa inferred from metabarcoding. Whole-genome sequences of corals and their symbionts are an invaluable resource to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the functioning and resilience of the holobiont. Recent genomic studies have shown that the coral host, dinoflagellate symbionts, and prokaryotes living in the coral tissue have complementary pathways for nutrient exchange, highlighting the interdependence and possible co-evolution between these members of the coral holobiont <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. To date, most work has focused on the coral animal and microbiota associated with its living tissue, with very little work done on the highly biodiverse and functionally important microbiota inhabiting the skeleton of the coral <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p><p>The green alga Ostreobium sp. is an important eukaryotic symbiont living inside the coral skeleton ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. This endolithic alga is the principal agent of coral reef bioerosion, burrowing through the limestone skeleton of corals and other reef structures and dissolving up to a kilogram of reef CaCO 3 per m 2 per year <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.

Part of the carbohydrates produced by Ostreobium photosynthesis makes their way into the coral tissue, extending the time it can survive without its dinoflagellate partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. While these ecological and physiological phenomena have been described, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved is scarce, severely limiting our understanding of key processes in healthy and bleached holobionts.

Developing this knowledge will be essential to understand and manage the roles that skeletal microbiota play during coral bleaching.</p><p>Ostreobium has an extreme lifestyle for a green alga <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. It lives in a very dimly lit environment, with mostly the low-energy, far-red wavelengths not used up by Symbiodiniaceae available <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The action spectrum of Ostreobium photosynthesis extends into far-red wavelengths, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are little known <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. The daily rhythm of oxygenic photosynthesis and respiration within the skeletal matrix leads to strong fluctuations of pH and O , ranging from total anoxia at night to ca. 60% of air saturation during the day <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, and the skeleton limits diffusion of O and other compounds. Free-living algae do not normally encounter these stressful conditions, and the mechanisms allowing Ostreobium to thrive in this extreme habitat are virtually unknown.</p><p>From an evolutionary perspective, Ostreobium is a member of the green plant lineage (Viridiplantae), which includes the land plants that originated in the Streptophyta lineage and a broad diversity of algae in the Chlorophyta lineage <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1C</ref>). Ostreobium is in Bryopsidales, an order of marine algae that has evolved in the Chlorophyta. While Ostreobium forms microscopic filaments, many representatives of this order are larger seaweeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>So far, the genomic resources available for coral holobiont research have been limited to the coral animal, its dinoflagellate photosymbionts, and a small fraction of the prokaryotes associated with its tissue (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> [2] <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>). Here, we present the first nuclear genome of an Ostreobium species to extend the available genomic toolkit into the coral skeleton, an element of the holobiont crucial for our comprehension of coral resilience, bleaching, and recovery. We expect that these genomic resources will spur new insights into processes of coral bleaching encompassing the entire holobiont, as this knowledge will be essential to safeguard the future of coral reefs in a changing climate. Based on comparative analyses of the Ostreobium genome with those of other green algae, we show Ostreobium's innovations in light-harvesting antennae and derive insights and hypotheses about its functions as a coral symbiont, and as an alga living in an extreme environment.</p><p>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>We obtained a draft nuclear genome of Ostreobium quekettii (SAG culture collection strain 6.99, non-axenic) by assembling sequence reads from Illumina and Nanopore platforms (Data S1). We assembled the final haploid nuclear genome in 2,857 scaffolds (total 146.26 MB of assembled bases; N50 length 73.43 KB), with an average sequence coverage of 99.72x for short-read data and 25.2x for long-read data. The genome is diploid with ~1.29% heterozygosity. The GC content is 52.4%, which is higher than 40.4% of Caulerpa lentillifera (the closest relative of Ostreobium for which a nuclear genome has been sequenced), but less than most other green algae (Data S1). Gene annotation of the haploid representation of the genome resulted in 10,663 predicted protein-coding genes, of which RNA sequencing data supported ~52%. We recovered 60.7% of the complete core conserved BUSCO eukaryote genes, which is similar to C.lentillifera (59.2%) and Ulva mutabilis (65.8%) (Data S1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photobiology in a dark place</head><p>Our work shows that Ostreobium has more light-harvesting complex (LHC) proteins than most green algae and Arabidopsis thaliana <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 2A</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S1</ref>). This expansion of the LHC protein arsenal is found in both photosystems, with duplications of the Lhca1 and Lhca6 gene families associated with PSI ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S1A</ref>) and the presence of both Lhcp and Lhcb families associated with PSII ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S1B</ref>).</p><p>Most green algae possess a single Lhca1 gene, while Ostreobium has two Lhca1 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure    2</ref>).

While most microalgae have a single Lhca6 copy (and none in the seaweeds C. lentillifera and U. mutabilis), Ostreobium contains three copies ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S1A</ref>), supported by different chromosomal contexts and their presence in our transcriptome.</p><p>In the PSII-associated LHC, Ostreobium possesses an unusual combination of both the Lhcp and major light-harvesting complex (Lhcb) protein families <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 2A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S1B</ref>).</p><p>Lhcb is found in most species of the green lineage except prasinophytes that use the Lhcp family instead <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Only the streptophyte Mesostigma viridis is known to encode proteins of both families ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S1B</ref>), suggesting that Lhcp and Lhcb were both part of the LHCII antenna system of the green plant ancestor and the families were differentially lost in different green algal and land plant lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>.</p><p>Although Ostreobium shows a high diversity of LHC genes, it lacks many genes for photoprotection and photoreceptors.

Ostreobium also lacks all the lightharvesting complex-like (LIL) genes coding for OHP1, OHP2, LIL3, ELIP, and four-helix proteins. While the function of LIL proteins has not been comprehensively determined, their involvement in response to light stress is known <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. The loss of genes involved in high-light sensitivity also extends to the chloroplast genome of Ostreobium, which lacks the chloroplast envelope membrane protein gene (cemA) that is needed in Chlamydomonas to persist in highlight conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Ostreobium has fewer known photoreceptors than do most other green algae. We identified three blue light photoreceptors: a phototropin (not shown), a plant cryptochrome, and a photolyase/blue-light receptor (PHR1; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S2</ref>). Given the predominance of far-red light in coral skeletons, one might expect the red/far-red phytochromes to be present in Ostreobium, but this was not the case.

Most green algae appear to have no specific photoreceptors for red light <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, but the animal-like cryptochrome in Chlamydomonas can be activated by red light <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. This protein's functions include the transcription of genes involved in photosynthesis, pigment biosynthesis, cell cycle control and circadian clock <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. This gene is not found in Ostreobium, which also lacks the Cry-DASHtype cryptochromes observed in many other green algae ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S2</ref>). Ostreobium does have two genes similar to the Arabidopsis putative blue-light receptor protein called PAS/LOV (Uniprot O64511) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Ostreobium also lacks the rhodopsin-like photoreceptors.</p><p>Besides the photoprotective LHC genes and photoreceptors, Ostreobium and C. lentillifera appear to have lost the light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), another important light signalling gene involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis. The reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide can be catalysed by either of two non-homologous enzymes: the nuclear encoded LPOR and the plastid-encoded light-independent (DPOR) protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. Most green algae have both systems, and DPOR has been lost in many eukaryotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. The Ostreobium genome provides the first evidence for the loss of LPOR in any eukaryote, and a screening of C. lentillifera also came back negative, suggesting that the loss may have occurred in the common ancestor of Bryopsidales. Both genera encode DPOR in their chloroplast genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. Although both enzymes catalyse the same reaction, they have different features: DPOR is encoded, synthesised and active in the plastid, and is highly sensitive to oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, while the nucleus-encoded LPOR is synthesised in the cytosol and active in the plastid, and requires light to be activated <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. DPOR might be an advantage over LPOR for endolithic photosynthetic organisms because of the low-light, lowoxygen environments they inhabit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The unusually large arsenal of LHC proteins appears to be confined to the Ostreobium lineage. The genus is present in a diverse range of light environments, from old oyster shells in the intertidal, where it experiences full-spectrum sunlight, to the coral skeleton (far-red enriched) and in mesophotic habitats (blue light), hinting at its capability to harvest energy from photons of many different wavelengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. While from the genome data alone, we cannot derive that the different LHC proteins convey a capability for photosynthesis at different wavelengths, it is known that different molecular arrangements of LHC proteins and the specific pigments binding to them have an impact on their spectral properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>, which could help Ostreobium acclimate to different light environments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interactions with other holobiont members</head><p>As far as holobiont functioning goes, interactions between the coral animal and its algal and bacterial symbionts are best understood, and interactions between the Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria are just starting to come into focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref>, but little is known about interactions involving Ostreobium. It is well known that several algae are auxotrophic for certain nutrients, e.g. vitamin B12 (cobalamin), a cofactor involved in the synthesis of methionine that many algae obtain from associated bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref>. The Ostreobium genome shows that the metabolic pathways involved in the production of vitamins B1, B2, B6 and B9 are complete, but it is auxotrophic for vitamin B12 (cobalamin). The Ostreobium genome encodes a B12-independent methionine synthase (METE) in addition to the B12-dependent version (METH, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>), so while the alga most likely does not strictly require B12 for growth, the presence of METH suggests that it uses B12 provided by other holobiont members.

An expanded repertoire of ammonia transporters was identified in Ostreobium (Data S1), potentially reflecting an adaptation to increase and diversify ammonia uptake in the alga.

It adds to the evidence for the roles that endolithic organisms play in the holobiont N cycle. During carbon cycling in the holobiont, glucose has been postulated as one of the main carbohydrates exchanged between Symbiodiniaceae and corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. While carbon compounds fixed by endoliths are known to be transferred to the coral animal and subsequently assimilated, neither the exact transferred molecules nor the molecular mechanisms involved in their translocation have been characterised, but the Ostreobium genome encodes four genes coding for H + -glucose transporters that might be involved in this process (Data S1).</p></div>

Our work clearly shows genomic adaptations of Ostreobium to the low light and variable oxygen conditions it experiences in endolithic environments, with an unparalleled arsenal of light-harvesting complexes and expansions in pathways for fermentation and reactive oxygen processing. Despite this progress, many questions remain about the mechanisms involved in this alga's interaction with the holobiont, their immediate physiological effects on the partners and longer-term ecological consequences.</p><p>One challenge in this area of research is that the roles and impacts of Ostreobium vary in time, with a relatively minor contribution to holobiont photosynthesis in healthy corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The results and datasets generated in this study provide a foundational reference for future research into the biology of this key holobiont member, and the intricate role that Ostreobium plays in coral biology. This will be of particular importance in the light of global climate change, as the increased frequency of bleaching and lower pH will boost Ostreobium populations and carbonate dissolution rates.</p><p>.

Briefly, for scaffolds that were not designated as chlorophyte sequences, we assessed the genome scaffold individually based on a combination of other criteria (i.e., taxonomic designation, outliers of GC-content and/or read coverage, and mapping of transcripts and intron-containing transcripts). Following Blobtools [67], for GC content and read coverage independently, we define an outlier as a value outside of the range of median ± interquartile range. For scaffolds that have no taxonomic designation, we do not exclude read-coverage outlier sequences if their GC is within the expected range, as these sequences likely represent repetitive regions of the genome. For scaffolds with a bacterial designation and mapped Ostreobium transcripts, we further require &gt;10% of these transcripts to contain intron(s) to identify these scaffolds as non-contaminant. Full-length organellar genome sequences were also recovered using known O. quekettii plastid (KY509314.1) and mitochondrial (NC_045361.1) genomes as query in a BLASTn search and removed from the assembly.

We ran identical BUSCO analyses on the C. lentillifera, Ulva mutabilis and C. reinhardtii genomes to allow direct comparison (Data S1). The coral skeleton and live tissue were collected using a hammer and chisel and were transported in seawater to perform the experiment at the Instituto de Ciencias del Mar y Limnología, UNAM. Three fragments were placed in each control and "experimental" tank at ~28ºC. Following 18 days of acclimation, heaters were turned on in the treatment tank to reach ~32ºC. After five days of severe heat exposure, bleached corals were moved back into the control tank to recover at 28ºC, where they remained for 38 days (post-bleaching period). Postbleached and controlled coral fragments were flash-frozen and preserved in liquid nitrogen.</p></div>

The enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (catalysing the production of acetaldehyde from pyruvate) was not found but the reaction is probably catalysed by another enzyme. We expect Ostreobium to use other electron acceptors to produce ATP and re-oxidize NAD(P)H and FADH2. Ostreobium possesses the enzymes required to produce succinate, lactate, formate, acetate, ethanol, alanine, and glycerol, but lacks H and acetate production from acetyl-CoA (PAT1/PAT2 and ACK1/ACK2).

While expression levels for these haplotypes tended to increase, some did not change significantly while others differed by an order of magnitude or more. These differences suggest that Ostreobium strains may differ physiologically or change in relative abundance during the experiment. Such differences in the microbiome -whether Ostreobium strains or other holobiont members -may result in high variability among coral samples in experimental work. Indeed, we found considerable differences in expression levels between samples within conditions, suggesting that future metatranscriptome experiments should be planned to use generous replication. The metatranscriptomes also provide some hints as to where Ostreobium may source its needs for vitamin B12 (cobalamin). We detected 29 bacterial transcripts from the vitamin B12 pathway, including several Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria that are known to be abundant in the coral skeleton (Data S1) [43]. These results contribute to defining potential mutualistic relationships between bacteria and Ostreobium in the holobiont</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>However, our results are showing that Ostreobium blooms during bleaching cause a shift of expression levels between microbiome members, with Ostreobium becoming the dominant oxygenic phototroph. These changes likely have implications flowing through the entire microbiome interaction network, but our knowledge of this is in its infancy. Important questions remain as to what extent the Ostreobium bloom leads to a beneficial metabolite exchange with the coral host, and how the fitness costs/benefits of Ostreobium add up across the entire coral life cycle. The fact that there are &gt;80 different species-level operational taxonomic units in Ostreobium complicates the matter further [43, 60]. Genome-scale data from Ostreobium and other interacting partners critically link these physiological features to underlying molecular mechanisms.</figDesc></figure>

			<abstract>
				<p>Coral reefs provide habitats for a disproportionate number of marine species relative to the small area of the oceans that they occupy. The mutualism between the cnidarian animal hosts and their intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts provides the nutritional foundation for coral growth and formation of reef structures, because algal photosynthesis can provide .90% of the total energy of the host. Disruption of this symbiosis (&quot;coral bleaching&quot;) is occurring on a large scale due primarily to anthropogenic factors and poses a major threat to the future of coral reefs. Despite the importance of this symbiosis, the cellular mechanisms involved in its establishment, maintenance, and breakdown remain largely unknown. We report our continued development of genomic tools to study these mechanisms in Aiptasia, a small sea anemone with great promise as a model system for studies of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Specifically, we have generated de novo assemblies of the transcriptomes of both a clonal line of symbiotic anemones and their endogenous dinoflagellate symbionts. We then compared transcript abundances in animals with and without dinoflagellates. This analysis identified .900 differentially expressed genes and allowed us to generate testable hypotheses about the cellular functions affected by symbiosis establishment. The differentially regulated transcripts include .60 encoding proteins that may play roles in transporting various nutrients between the symbiotic partners; many more encoding proteins functioning in several metabolic pathways, providing clues regarding how the transported nutrients may be used by the partners; and several encoding proteins that may be involved in host recognition and tolerance of the dinoflagellate. KEYWORDS anemone dinoflagellate innate immunity metabolic compartmentation symbiosis Coral reefs comprise only a small part of the world&apos;s ocean environment but are habitats for a disproportionately large fraction of all marine species. Corals are able to produce the massive and biologically rich reef habitats despite growing in nutrient-poor waters because of the energy acquired through their mutualistic symbiosis with dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. These unicellular algae inhabit the symbiosomes (phagosome-derived vacuoles) of gastrodermal cells in corals and other cnidarians (Figure 1) and transfer up to 95% of their photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host (Muscatine et al. 1984). Reef-building corals are declining worldwide due largely to anthropogenic causes, which include pollution, destructive fishing practices, and increasing sea-surface temperatures (De&apos;ath et al. 2012). Such stresses can lead to coral &quot;bleaching&quot;, in which the algae lose their photosynthetic capacity and/or are lost altogether by the host. In severe cases, bleaching can result in the death of the host. The threat of bleaching is particularly alarming because many corals already live near the upper limits of their thermal tolerances, and most climate-change models predict that these tolerances will be exceeded frequently in the coming decades, leading to widespread coral death and a resulting loss of the reef habitats (Hughes et al. 2003).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite the great ecological importance of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these relationships are established, maintained, or disrupted <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Davy et al. 2012)</ref>. This situation has resulted in part from the difficulties inherent in studying corals directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Weis et al. 2008)</ref>. Thus, we and others have turned to the small sea anemone Aiptasia, which is normally symbiotic with dinoflagellates closely related to those found in corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Lajeunesse et al. 2012)</ref> but offers many experimental advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Weis et al. 2008)</ref>. In particular, Aiptasia lacks the calcareous skeleton that hinders biochemical and microscopic analyses of corals, grows rapidly by asexual reproduction under standard aquarium conditions to form large clonal populations, can be induced to spawn and produce larvae throughout the year in the laboratory (S. F. <ref type="bibr">Perez and J. R. Pringle, unpublished data)</ref>, and (importantly for this study) can be maintained indefinitely in an aposymbiotic (bleached) state so long as it is fed regularly <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Schoenberg and Trench 1980)</ref>. The intracellular localization of the dinoflagellate <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>) raises some key questions about regulation of the symbiosis. First, how does the host recognize, take up, and maintain appropriate symbionts without generating a deleterious immune response that could result in a failure of algal uptake, digestion of the algae after uptake, or apoptosis of the host cells? Second, what metabolites do the two organisms exchange across the symbiosome membrane, and how? It seems likely that the symbiotic state involves both transporters and regulation of metabolic pathways that are distinct from those found in aposymbiotic animals. Third, what changes in transport occur at other membranes? For example, although both gastrodermal and epidermal cells in aposymbiotic anemones presumably excrete ammonium as a toxic waste product, as do other aquatic invertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Wright 1995)</ref>, at least some of that ammonium must be redirected to the dinoflagellates in symbiotic anemones <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Pernice et al. 2012)</ref>. Particularly intriguing questions are how the epidermal tissue layer is nourished (as it lacks both dinoflagellate symbionts and direct access to food particles in the gastric cavity) and whether the nature and mechanisms of this nourishment change upon the establishment of symbiosis.</p><p>To investigate these questions, we used RNA-Seq to generate an extensive, annotated transcriptome assembly for symbiotic Aiptasia. This transcriptome was then used as a reference to compare global transcript abundances between symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones. Previous studies have identified few genes that were differentially expressed between the two states, possibly because of the insensitivity of the technologies used, the small fraction of cells that contain dinoflagellates, and/or a lack of probes for the relevant genes. In contrast, we identified nearly 1000 genes with significant expression differences, many of which were large. Many of these expression differences suggest interesting and testable biological hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>Aiptasia strain and culture All animals were from clonal population CC7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Sunagawa et al. 2009)</ref>, which in spawning experiments typically behaves as a male (S. F. <ref type="bibr">Perez and J. R. Pringle, unpublished data)</ref>. For experiments performed at Stanford, the stock cultures were grown in a circulating artificial sea water (ASW) system at $25Â°with 20 to 40 mmol photons m 22 s 21 of photosynthetically active radiation on an $12-hr light/12-hr dark (12L:12D) cycle and fed freshly hatched brine shrimp nauplii approximately twice per week. To generate aposymbiotic anemones, animals were placed in a separate polycarbonate tub and subjected to several repetitions of the following process: cold-shocking by addition of 4Â°A SW and incubation at 4Â°for 4 hr, followed by 1-2 days of treatment at $25Â°in ASW containing the photosynthesis inhibitor Diuron (Sigma-Aldrich D2425) at 50 mM (lighting approximately as noted above). After recovery for several weeks in ASW at $25Â°in the light (as noted above) with feeding (as noted above, with water changes on the days following feeding), putatively aposymbiotic anemones were inspected by fluorescence microscopy to confirm the complete absence of dinoflagellates (whose bright chlorophyll autofluorescence is conspicuous when they are present).</p><p>For experiments performed at Cornell, anemones were grown in incubators at 25Â°in ASW in 1-liter glass bowls and fed (as noted above) approximately three times per week. Symbiotic anemones were kept on a 12L:12D cycle at 18 to 22 mmol photons m 22 s 21 of photosynthetically active radiation. Aposymbiotic animals were generated by exposing anemones under the same lighting and feeding regimen to 50 mM Diuron in ASW, with daily water changes, for $30 d or until the anemones were devoid of algae, as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. After bleaching, aposymbiotic anemones were maintained in the dark for $2 yr (with feeding as noted above) before experimentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p>Three separate experiments were performed using somewhat different conditions <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. For experiment 1 (RNA-Seq), both symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones were held at 27Â°on a 12L:12D cycle, with feeding and water changes as noted above, for 1 month before sampling to allow them to acclimate. The aposymbiotic anemones were checked immediately before sampling by fluorescence microscopy to ensure that they were still symbiont-free. Anemones were collected $2 d after the last feeding and $5 hr into the light period. Each of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> The spatial organization of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. A simplified schematic diagram of a section of cnidarian body wall is shown; note that the drawing is not to scale (e.g., the dinoflagellate typically fills most of the symbiosome). The two major tissue layers are the epiderm, which faces the outside sea water and lacks both dinoflagellate symbionts and direct access to food in the gastric cavity, and the gastroderm, which faces the gastric cavity and may contain dinoflagellate symbionts in some of its cells. These two cell layers are separated by the largely acellular mesoglea. After phagocytosis by a host gastrodermal cell, the dinoflagellate resides within a "symbiosome" (believed to be derived from a phagosome that does not fuse with lysosomes) and transfers fixed carbon to the host.</p><p>three biological replicates per condition consisted of two to five pooled anemones (for a total of $35 mg wet weight); samples were stored in RNALater (Ambion AM7021) at 220Â°until processing.</p><p>For experiment 2 (RNA-Seq), both symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones were starved for 2 wk before sampling. Symbiotic anemones were maintained at 25Â°on a 12L:12D cycle, whereas aposymbiotic anemones were maintained at 25Â°in constant dark. Anemones were collected 9 hr into the light period of the symbiotic anemones. Four symbiotic or eight aposymbiotic anemones ($50 mg wet weight in each case) were pooled in each of four biological replicates per treatment, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and held at 280Â°until processing.</p><p>For experiment 3 (RT-qPCR), both symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones were maintained at 25Â°on a 12L:12D cycle with feeding every 2 d, followed by water changes; samples were collected 2 d after the last feeding and 6 hr into the light period. Collection and storage of anemones were as in experiment 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNA isolation and sequencing</head><p>In experiment 1, total RNA was extracted from whole anemones using the RNAqueous-4PCR Kit (Ambion AM1914) following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA-integrity number (RIN) of each sample was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and only samples with a value of nine or more were used. Approximately 3 mg total RNA were processed (including a poly-A + -selection step) using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina FC-122-1001) following the manufacturer's instructions to produce indexed libraries. The resulting libraries were pooled based on their indices (as described in the kit instructions), and clustering and sequencing (both 101-bp paired-end reads and 36-bp single-end reads) were performed by the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer.</p><p>In experiments 2 and 3, total RNA was extracted using the ToTALLY RNA Total RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion AM1910) following the manufacturer's instructions, except that the RNA was precipitated using 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 4 volumes of 100% ethanol. The resulting RNA was purified using the RNA Clean and Concentrator-25 Kit (Zymo Research R1017). For RNA-Seq, the RIN of each sample was verified to be nine or more using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and $4 mg total RNA per sample were processed using the TruSeq Kit (as noted above) to produce indexed libraries. The resulting libraries were pooled into eight samples per lane, and clustering and sequencing (101-bp paired-end reads) were performed by the Cornell Life Sciences Core Laboratory Center using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. Processing of samples for RT-qPCR is described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Read filtering and transcriptome assembly and annotation</head><p>Transcriptome assembly used all of the 101-bp paired-end reads obtained from symbiotic anemones at both Stanford and Cornell <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>; reads available through the NCBI Short-Read Archive). Before assembly, the reads were processed as follows: (1) reads of ,60 bp or containing $1 N were discarded; (2) any read for which ,25 of the first 35 bases had quality scores .30 was discarded; and (3) reads were trimmed to the first position for which a sliding 4-bp window had an average quality score of ,20. The remaining readpairs were then processed using FLASH <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Magoc and Salzberg 2011)</ref> to join reads whose ends overlapped by $10 bp with no mismatches. Finally, adapter sequencers were removed using cutadapt with the default settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Martin 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The processed reads were assembled in three sets because of memory constraints. Each set was assembled using an additivemultiple-k-mer approach <ref type="bibr">(k-mers of 51, 59, 67, 75, 83, 91)</ref> with the Velvet/Oases assembler (Velvet version 1.1.07 and Oases version 0.2.02) <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Zerbino and Birney 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Schulz et al. 2012)</ref> and merged using the Oases merge function with a k-mer of 27. The final outputs of each assembly were merged with one another by again using the Oases merge function. Near-identical contigs ($99% identical over the length of the shorter contig) were merged using UCLUST version 5.2.32 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Edgar 2010)</ref>. To cluster alternative transcripts from the same gene (and presumably also transcripts from highly similar paralogs), UCLUST was used again, as follows. Contigs were aligned locally in both directions and clustered together if the alignment consisted of $20% of the total length of each contig and the sequence was $99% identical over the alignment. These parameters were chosen because they produced valid clusters on a test dataset from zebrafish in 93% of cases (with the remaining cases being mostly the near-identical paralogs common in teleosts because of genome duplication) (E. <ref type="bibr">Lehnert and B. Benayoun, unpublished results)</ref>.</p><p>To assign putative functional roles to the transcripts, we aligned them to the SwissProt protein database and the NCBI nonredundant protein database (nr) using the blastx program from the standalone BLAST 2.2.25+ software suite with an E-value cutoff of 1e25 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Camacho et al. 2009)</ref>. The results of the alignment to SwissProt were imported using the Blast2GO software package and used to assign Enzyme Codes and Gene Ontology (GO) terms to the predicted proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ashburner et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Conesa et al. 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Classification of contig origin using a transcript-sorting algorithm and alignment of genomic reads</head><p>To classify contigs into those derived from Aiptasia, those from the dinoflagellate symbionts, and those from other aquarium organisms that might have been in the gastric cavities or associated with the mucous coats of the isolated anemones, we developed the machinelearning program TopSort, which uses support vector machines to classify transcripts as cnidarian, dinoflagellate, fungal, or bacterial <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Burriesci 2011)</ref>. The basic principle of TopSort is that if there are N features for each element in a dataset, each element can be represented as a point defined by these features in N-dimensional hyperspace. If classes of elements are distinguishable by the N features, then there should be an N-1-dimensional hyperplane that cuts the space such that one class can be separated from the others. If elements are clustered such that they are separable by another shape in N-space (e.g., a hypersphere), then an appropriate transform of the hyperspace to another space will make them separable by a hyperplane. The features used for TopSort were GC content, amino acid and codon biases (where a strong BLAST hit allowed a reliable prediction of reading frame), phylogenetic classification of the top five best BLAST hits to the nr database (scoring each hit as cnidarian, non-cnidarian animal, dinoflagellate, non-dinoflagellate alveolate, plant, fungus, bacteria, or none-of-the-above), and best BLAST hit to a custom database composed of the sequences of known origin that were not chosen for either the training or test set. BLAST hits to the species from which the training and test sequence sets were derived were discarded to avoid the potential development of a classifier that was highly accurate on the test and training sets but useless for a novel dataset.</p><p>To build the training and test sets and the custom database, we used publicly available sequences for the cnidarians Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata; the dinoflagellates Alexandrium tamarense, A. catenella, A. ostenteldii, A. mitum, Karlodinium micrum, Karenia brevis, and Symbiodinium strain KB8 (clade A); the fungi Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus niger, and Neurospora crassa; and the bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica (see Supporting Information, File S1 for accession numbers). We also included contigs from an earlier aposymbiotic Aiptasia transcriptome <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lehnert et al. 2012</ref>) that had $30 reads mapping to them from the aposymbiotic libraries produced during experiment 1 of this study, as well as a large set of contigs from axenically cultured clade B Symbiodinium strain SSB01 (Xiang et al. 2013; T. Xiang and A. Grossman, personal communication). Sequences from each of the four phylogenetic groups were binned by length (150-300, 300-500, and .500 bp), and equal numbers of sequences from each phylogenetic group were selected randomly from each bin (1076 for 150-300 bp; 2000 for both 300-500; and .500 bp) to make the training set, whereas equivalent numbers were selected to make the test set. The remaining sequences from each phylogenetic group were assigned to the custom database.</p><p>In addition, we tested the assembled contigs for alignment to Aiptasia genomic DNA sequences. We isolated genomic DNA from aposymbiotic Aiptasia and obtained approximately 101 Gb of untrimmed sequence reads from six separate libraries (accession numbers SRR646474 and SRR606428). We aligned the genomic read-pairs to our contigs and obtained the mean count of read-pairs for each contig from the six libraries. A previous test had shown that only 20 of $60,000 contigs derived from cultured axenic Symbiodinium strain SSB01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Xiang et al. 2013</ref>; T. Xiang and A. Grossman, personal communication) had any Aiptasia genomic reads mapping to them. However, this clade B strain may have many sequence differences from the clade A strain found in CC7 anemones, so it seemed conceivable that low levels of Symbiodinium in the putatively aposymbiotic anemones from which the genomic DNA was derived might lead to misclassification of dinoflagellate transcripts as cnidarian. We determined that 15,499 of the 23,794 contigs classified as dinoflagellate by TopSort had zero genomic reads mapping to them, whereas the median of the mean read counts for the contigs classified by TopSort as cnidarian was $200. Thus, we chose a mean read count of 10 as the cut-off to classify a contig as cnidarian by genomic evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expression analysis by RNA-Seq</head><p>The 36-bp reads (experiment 1) were trimmed as described above. With the 101-bp paired-end reads (experiment 2), the forward reads were shortened to 36 bp for expression analysis and then trimmed as described above. Reads were aligned using bwa <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Li and Durbin 2009)</ref> to the representative contigs (i.e., the longest contig in each cluster produced by UCLUST; see above). A read was counted toward the total for each contig if it aligned with no errors or gaps to a unique region of the transcriptome. The R package DESeq was used to call contigs as differentially expressed if the false-discovery-rate-adjusted P # 0.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anders and Huber 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Expression analysis by RT-qPCR RNA was extracted and purified as described above, treated with DNase using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion AM1907) following the manufacturer's instructions, and diluted to a concentration of ng/ml. cDNA was then synthesized using the GoScript Reverse Transcriptase System (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table S2)</ref> were designed using Primer Quest (Integrated DNA Technologies) for 29 contigs with a variety of read counts and expression patterns; four of these contigs had previously been identified as appropriate internal reference standards as described below. The predicted product sizes of 110-238 bp were confirmed by agarosegel electrophoresis after conventional PCR amplification. Primer efficiencies were determined using Real-time PCR Miner <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Zhao and Fernald 2005)</ref> and ranged from 90% to 100%. The RT-qPCR products were also sequenced (Cornell Life Sciences Core Laboratory Center), and all matched the expected product identities.</p><p>To quantify transcript levels, we used a ViiA 7 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) with reaction conditions as follows: 12.5 ml of 2â€¢ Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 200 nmol of each primer, and 18 ng of cDNA in a total volume of 25 ml. Each sample and a no-template control was run in duplicate with thermocycler parameters of 95Â°for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95Â°for 15 sec and 60Â°f or 60 sec, and a subsequent dissociation curve to confirm the absence of nonspecific products. To confirm the absence of genomic-DNA contamination, a pool of all eight RNA samples (see above) was used as template in a separate reaction as described above except omitting the reverse-transcriptase. Real-time PCR Miner was used to calculate the critical threshold (C T ) of each gene from the raw fluorescence data.</p><p>To identify reliable reference standards to use for qPCR normalization, we evaluated six housekeeping genes that appeared to be plausible candidates and have been used for this purpose in previous studies of cnidarian gene expression (File S1). Briefly, the expression levels of these genes were tested across a variety of experimental conditions (e.g., heat shock and cold shock) in both aposymbiotic and symbiotic anemones and evaluated for stability of expression using the software geNorm <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Vandesompele et al. 2002)</ref>. Based on this analysis, the genes encoding 60S ribosomal protein L11, 40S ribosomal protein S7, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5, and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase were selected as standards. The stabilities of these genes in experiment 3 were confirmed using geNorm before calculating a normalization factor from the geometric mean of their expression values <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Vandesompele et al. 2002)</ref>  <ref type="table">(Table S1</ref>). The expression levels of all 29 genes were then normalized via the normalization factor, and relative expression values were calculated using the following equation: 1/(1 + Primer Efficiency)^C T . Log 2 fold-changes in expression in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic anemones were then calculated as the quotients of the relative expression values from the aforementioned equation. The R software package was used to perform correlations between log 2 fold-change data from qPCR and RNA-Seq experiment 1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequencing and assembly of the transcriptome of symbiotic Aiptasia</head><p>We isolated total RNA from a clonal population of symbiotic anemones raised under nonstressful culture conditions, enriched for poly-A + RNA, and used this RNA to synthesize paired-end Illumina libraries, from which we obtained a total of $345 million pairs of reads containing $70 Gb of sequence. The raw reads were trimmed and processed as described in Materials and Methods, leaving $228 million pairs of reads and $45 Gb of sequence. These reads were assembled in three batches using Velvet/Oases and a multiple-k-mer approach (see Materials and Methods). The resulting assemblies were merged using the Oases merge option, and redundant contigs ($99% identical over the length of the shorter contig) were collapsed using UCLUST, yielding an initial set of 140,945 contigs with lengths of 102 to 32,510 bp.</p><p>To estimate the number of genes represented by these contigs and to choose a representative contig for each gene, we clustered contigs with good alignments ($99% identical over $20% of the length of the shorter contig). This resulted in 52,717 clusters, and the longest contig from each was taken as representative for further analysis (see File S4 for the full set of 52,717 representative contigs). Although 31,014 clusters contained only a single contig, 19,380 contained two to nine contigs, and 2323 clusters contained 10 or more contigs, with a largest cluster of 230 contigs (see Discussion).</p><p>Classification of contigs using TopSort and comparison to genomic sequence It is difficult or impossible to obtain animal RNA without contamination by RNA from the intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts and (although presumably in much smaller amounts) from other organisms in the nonsterile aquarium system. To address this issue, we developed the TopSort support-vector-machines algorithm to classify contigs as putatively of cnidarian, dinoflagellate, bacterial, or fungal origin. Sequences of reliably known origin were used to create training and test sets, and each contig was scored on several metrics (see Materials and Methods). After training on the training set, the accuracy of TopSort on the test set was $95% for contigs of 150-300 bp and .99% for contigs of .300 bp, for an overall error rate of 2-3%.</p><p>We used TopSort to classify the 52,717 representative contigs in our dataset <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>, column B). As expected, most contigs were classified as cnidarian or dinoflagellate. However, the 2-3% error rate of TopSort with the test dataset suggested that hundreds of the putatively cnidarian contigs might actually be dinoflagellate contigs that had been misclassified, which would be a significant problem for subsequent analyses of gene-expression differences between symbiotic and aposymbiotic animals. Thus, we also aligned reads from Aiptasia genomic-DNA sequence libraries to the transcriptome (see Materials and Methods). Approximately 94% of the contigs classified by TopSort as cnidarian had supporting genomic evidence, as compared to only $5% of contigs classified by TopSort as noncnidarian <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>, columns C-E). These results validated the performance of TopSort in initial classification and yielded a set of 26,219 high-confidence Aiptasia contigs (henceforth referred to as "cnidarian"), on which we have focused for our further analyses to date. In the remainder of this article, we also use the term "dinoflagellate" to refer to the 22,668 contigs classified as dinoflagellate by TopSort and lacking matches to Aiptasia genomic DNA, and we refer to contigs for which the classifications by TopSort and genomic match conflicted as "ambiguous."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization and annotation of transcriptome</head><p>The cnidarian contigs ranged in size up to .32 kb, with a median of 1644 bp, whereas the dinoflagellate contigs had somewhat smaller maximum and median sizes ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). The remaining contigs ("Other" in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>) had a size distribution similar to those of the cnidarian and dinoflagellate contigs. It is therefore unlikely that the failure to classify these contigs as cnidarian or dinoflagellate was simply attributable to their being shorter than average and thus more difficult to annotate by BLAST or to align to genomic reads.</p><p>To assign putative functions to the representative cnidarian and dinoflagellate contigs, we used blastx to align them to the SwissProt and NCBI nr databases, retaining only alignments with E-values #1e-5. Of the 26,219 cnidarian contigs, 16,373 (62%) had such alignments to 9386 distinct accession numbers in SwissProt <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 4</ref>). In contrast, of the 22,668 dinoflagellate contigs, only 7895 ($35%) had such alignments to 5054 distinct accession numbers <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 4)</ref>. Similar numbers were obtained by aligning sequences to the nr database <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 4</ref>). Using Blast2GO with its default cutoff of 1e23, we assigned GO terms based on the SwissProt annotations. We were able to assign 10,521 distinct GO terms to cnidarian sequences and 5747 distinct GO terms to algal sequences.</p><p>To investigate why there were so few distinct accession numbers relative to the numbers of representative contigs, we examined the distributions of contigs per accession number <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 5</ref>). In both the cnidarian and dinoflagellate cases, $76% of accession numbers annotated only one representative contig, and another $14% annotated two representative contigs (as might occur with a duplicated gene or two sufficiently different alleles of the same gene). In contrast, some accession numbers were hit by much larger numbers of representative contigs <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 5</ref>). Although there are several possible explanations for such cases (including the existence of extended gene families, complex alternative splicing, and/or somatic differentiation), we suspect that most reflect a failure of contigs derived from the same gene to cluster with the algorithm used, perhaps because of repeat structures within the genes. In any case, if we assume (as a worst-case scenario) that all such cases result from such failures to cluster, and that the failure rate was identical between the successfully annotated and unannotated contigs, then we can infer that the numbers of "unigenes" (sequences derived from distinct genes) present in our dataset are $14,500 for Aiptasia and $14,000 for Symbiodinium, representing substantial fractions of the total gene numbers expected from information on other eukaryotes (see Discussion).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of differentially expressed transcripts</head><p>To compare gene expression in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic anemones, we performed two RNA-Seq experiments using somewhat different conditions (see Materials and Methods and <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). In each experiment, we identified many transcripts that appeared to be differentially expressed, including many in which the changes in abundance were five-fold or more <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 6</ref>, columns B and C). Although the two experiments identified many of the same genes, there were also differences that probably reflect both the noise inherent in such analyses and actual differences in expression attributable to the different experimental conditions. However, we hypothesized that any genes involved directly in the maintenance of symbiosis (e.g., genes encoding proteins found specifically in the symbiosome) would show similar expression differences in both experiments. Therefore, we identified these contigs <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 6</ref>, column D) and focused on them in subsequent analyses.</p><p>Although our further analyses to date have also focused on transcripts with convincing annotations by blastx, it is important to note that 101 of the cnidarian transcripts that appeared to be differentially expressed in both experiments, including 21 with expression changes of five-fold or more, could not be annotated at this time <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table 6</ref>, column E). Fifty-two of these transcripts (including four of the 21 with expression changes of five-fold or more) contained apparent open reading frames with $100 codons. Identifying the functions of these unknown proteins may be critical to understanding the structural and biochemical bases of the symbiosis.</p><p>To evaluate the reliability of the RNA-Seq data, we also performed an RT-qPCR experiment using culture conditions similar to those of experiment 1 <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. We tested 29 contigs that exhibited a range of fold-changes and read counts, including some that were of particular biological interest <ref type="table">(Table S1</ref>). To assess the overall agreement between the RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR experiments, we determined the Spearman rank correlation coefficient of the log fold-change for all contigs, excluding those that had apparently infinite changes in expression (i.e., were only found in either symbiotic or aposymbiotic anemones). The correlation coefficient of 0.96 (P = 3e214) showed a strong correlation between the RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR datasets.</p><p>In what follows, we discuss several sets of cnidarian genes whose differential expression suggests testable biological hypotheses.</p><p>Genes involved in metabolite transport Given the intimate relationship between the symbiotic partners, transporters involved in moving metabolites between compartments seem likely to be of special importance in maintaining the symbiosis. To identify such transporters, we screened the differentially expressed transcripts associated with the GO term "P:transport" for those encoding putative transporters of small molecules. Although the GO annotation of Aiptasia is incomplete, we were able to identify 48 upregulated and 18 downregulated transcripts encoding putative transporters and transport-related proteins <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table S3</ref>). We focus in what follows on the such proteins that were most highly upregulated in symbiotic anemones ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7)</ref>.</p><p>Transport of photosynthetically fixed carbon and other organic metabolites: Among the transcripts strongly upregulated in symbiotic anemones were two (Table 7, lines 1 and 2) that encode proteins n a The full list of assignments of individual contigs to their species of origin is provided in File S5.</p><p>b See text. c Genomic evidence was defined as $10 paired-end reads aligning from Aiptasia genomic DNA libraries prepared from aposymbiotic anemones (see Materials and Methods). d Classified as cnidarian by TopSort but lacking genomic evidence or classified as noncnidarian by TopSort but with apparent matches to Aiptasia genomic DNA. e Many of these are presumably transcripts from contaminants that were present on the surfaces or in the gastric cavity of the anemones from which the genomic DNA was prepared. However, the high rate of apparent false-positives among the putatively bacterial and fungal sequences probably also reflects Bayes' rule, whereby the ratio of false-positives to true-positives is high when the a priori probability of a true-positive is low.</p><p>n a Includes both the contigs classified as "ambiguous" (see text) and those classified as fungal or bacterial. b Some of the very long contigs may represent hairpin or chimeric assemblies, a possibility that we have not explored in detail. However, the predicted product of the 32,510-bp contig actually aligns to a portion of titin, a muscle protein that is the largest known protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Labeit and Kolmerer 1995)</ref> and ranges in size from 27,000 to 33,000 amino acids in humans, depending on the splice isoform <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Labeit and Kolmerer 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bang et al. 2001)</ref>.</p><p>closely related ($39% identify in amino acid sequence) to the mammalian facilitative glucose transporter GLUT8, which localizes to the endosome membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Augustin et al. 2005)</ref>. This localization depends on a dileucine motif near the N-terminus, and indeed dileucines are present at amino acids 32-33 and 26-27 of the two Aiptasia Glut8 proteins. One or both of the Aiptasia Glut8 proteins thus are likely to be involved in the transport of photosynthetically produced glucose across the symbiosome membrane into the host cytoplasm (see Discussion). However, it should also be noted that the transcript encoding a predicted Na + -glucose/myo-inositol co-transporter was detected only in symbiotic anemones ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref>, line 3), and a transcript encoding a related protein was also upregulated 2.2-fold <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table S3</ref>, line 26). Interestingly, a transcript encoding a third member of this protein class was strongly downregulated in symbiotic anemones <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table S3</ref>, line 65).</p><p>Lipids may also be an important energy currency in symbiotic animals (see further discussion below), and in this regard, it is interesting that the transcripts for a putative lipid-droplet surfacebinding protein (potentially involved in the mobilization of stored fats for transport), a protein similar to scavenger receptor class B member 1 (related to CD36-type fatty acid transport proteins), and a putative carnitine transporter (potentially involved in entry of fatty acids into mitochondria for degradation) were all strongly upregulated in symbiotic animals <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 7</ref>, lines 4-6). In the last regard, it should also be noted that the transcripts for several putative acyl-carnitine transferases were also upregulated in symbiotic anemones <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table S3,</ref> lines 25, 43, and 44).</p><p>Also dramatically upregulated was the transcript for a member (Npc2D) of the Npc2 protein family (line 7 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure  S1A</ref>). In mammalian and Drosophila cells, Npc2 binds cholesterol in the lumen of the endosome and lysosome and transfers it to Npc1, a transmembrane protein that exports the cholesterol to other intracellular locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Frolov et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Sleat et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Huang et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Infante et al. 2008)</ref>. Consistent with a previous study of the anemone Anemonia viridis (Ganot et al. 2011), we identified multiple transcripts encoding Npc2-like proteins in the Aiptasia transcriptome and in the transcriptomes of three other cnidarians. A multiplesequence alignment and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis identified two subclades, suggesting that there has been at least one duplication event in the Anthozoan lineage ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>). One subclade (including the Npc2A proteins of both A. viridis and Aiptasia) clustered with the canonical Npc2 proteins found in most animals (including mammals and Drosophila), whereas the second subclade contained both the A. viridis <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Sabourault et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ganot et al. 2011)</ref> and Aiptasia Npc2D proteins that are upregulated during symbiosis. Strikingly, all of the proteins in this second subclade have sequence alterations at conserved positions in the sterol-binding site ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). Mutations to alanine at these positions are known to disrupt cholesterol binding in human cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ko et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Wang et al. 2010)</ref>, raising interesting questions about the roles of these proteins in symbiotic cnidarians (see Discussion).</p><p>Other putative organic-metabolite transporters also showed large changes in expression. In particular, a transcript encoding a putative taurine transporter was detected only in symbiotic anemones <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 7</ref>, line 8), whereas the transcripts for an aromatic-amino-acid transporter and a GABA/glycine transporter were upregulated 4.9-fold and 6.9-fold, respectively (Table 7, lines 9 and 10). Interestingly, taurine has been reported to comprise $35% of the amino-acid pool in symbiotic Aiptasia <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Swanson and Hoegh-Guldberg 1998)</ref>, although its specific functions are not well-understood. Determining the intracellular localization of the transporter identified here could provide insight into the possible function(s) of taurine. The transcripts for other putative amino-acid transporters also showed significant differences in expression between symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table S3,</ref>  <ref type="bibr">lines 16, 28, 30, 34, 39, 40, 45, 52, and 55</ref>), suggesting that the establishment of symbiosis produces profound changes in amino-acid transport and metabolism (see Discussion).</p><p>Transport of inorganic nutrients: CO 2 is an excreted waste product for animals such as aposymbiotic anemones, but it is required for photosynthesis when dinoflagellate symbionts are present.

However, to maintain a high concentration of inorganic carbon in the symbiosome, the host may need to convert CO 2 to the less freely diffusing bicarbonate anion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bertucci et al. 2013)</ref>. We identified one carbonic-anhydrase gene that was upregulated 4.3-fold in symbiotic anemones <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 7</ref>, line 11), while a second gene was downregulated three-fold <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table S3</ref>, line 63). In addition, it is not clear that CO 2 diffuses sufficiently rapidly through the relevant membranes to support efficient photosynthesis, and some studies have suggested that aquaporins may play a role in facilitating this diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Kaldenhoff 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Uehlein et al. 2012)</ref>. Thus, it is of interest that that we found two aquaporins to be upregulated 13-fold and 4.3-fold in symbiotic anemones <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 7</ref>, rows 12 and 13).</p><p>Although aposymbiotic anemones, like other aquatic animals, excrete excess (and potentially toxic) ammonium produced by amino acid breakdown <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Wright 1995)</ref>, symbiotic anemones need to supply nitrogen to their dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Pernice et al. 2012)</ref>. Thus, it was not surprising that we found differentially expressed genes encoding am-monium transporters. These genes were in both of the two major families found in animals: a "rhesus-like" gene and an "AMT-like" gene were upregulated 130-fold and 5.9-fold, respectively, in symbiotic anemones ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref>, rows 14 and 15), suggesting that they might be involved with ammonium supply to the dinoflagellate, whereas another rhesus-like transporter was downregulated 2.9-fold <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table S3</ref>, row 61), suggesting that it might be involved in ammonium excretion.</p><p>The host must also supply other inorganic nutrients to the dinoflagellates. For example, phosphate and sulfate must be translocated across the symbiosome membrane either as the inorganic ions or as parts of some organic metabolites. In this regard, it is of interest that we found the genes for two putative inorganic-phosphate transporters to be upregulated approximately two-fold in symbiotic anemones, a gene for a putative UDP-sugar transporter to be upregulated 2.7fold, and a gene for a putative sulfate transporter to be upregulated 3.1-fold <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table S3,</ref>  <ref type="bibr">lines 19, 22, 27, and 42)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genes controlling certain metabolic pathways</head><p>To explore the integration of metabolite transport with the overall regulation of metabolic pathways, we looked for the presence and coordinated regulation of genes encoding the enzymes of particular pathways that we hypothesized might be involved in the animal's response to the presence of a symbiont. For these analyses, we used the full transcriptome but only the expression data from RNA-Seq experiment 1, because the starvation of the anemones in experiment 2 seemed likely to have had a strong effect on the expression of metabolicpathway genes.</p><p>Lipid metabolism: There appear to be systematic changes in lipid metabolism between symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones. Four genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty-acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a fatty-acid elongase, and Î” 5 -and Î” 6 -fatty acid desaturases) were upregulated 3.5-fold to 6.2-fold <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table S4</ref>, lines 1-4), and at least nine genes encoding proteins putatively involved in lipid storage or its regulation were also differentially regulated <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table S4</ref>, lines 5-13). In addition, many genes involved in b-oxidation of fatty acids were upregulated in symbiotic anemones <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S4</ref>, lines 17-21, 23, 24, and 30). Although some of the fold-changes were not large, the consistency is striking, and gastrodermal and epidermal cells may well differ in their expression patterns in ways that obscure the full extent of the changes in a particular cell population (see Discussion). Finally, although the glyoxylate cycle (which allows cells to achieve a net synthesis of longer carbon chains from two-carbon units such as those derived by b-oxidation) is not generally present in animal cells, we identified genes putatively encoding its two key enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table S4</ref>, lines 31 and 32), consistent with a previous report of the presence of this cycle in cnidarians <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kondrashov et al. 2006)</ref>. Although the malate-synthase transcript showed no statistically significant differential expression, the isocitrate-lyase transcript was upregulated 3.9-fold in symbiotic anemones. Interestingly, we did not see significant upregulation of the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for metabolizing mediumchain and short-chain fatty acyl-CoA (MCAD, SCAD, crotonase, and M/SCHAD in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table S4</ref>, lines 25-28), suggesting that the metabolic change accompanying the establishment of symbiosis primarily involves long-chain and/or very-long-chain fatty acids.</p><p>Amino-acid metabolism and the SAM cycle: Consistent with previous observations (Wang and Douglas 1998), we found that the transcripts for both a glutamine synthetase and an NADPH-dependent glutamate synthase were upregulated in symbiotic anemones ( <ref type="figure">Figure  4</ref>), suggesting that the epidermal cells, the gastrodermal cells, or both synthesize glutamate via a complete GS-GOGAT cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Miflin and Habash 2002)</ref> rather than (or in addition to) simply obtaining it from the dinoflagellate. We also identified both upregulated and <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> Npc2-like proteins that putatively do or do not have the ability to transport cholesterol. (A) Consensus phylogenetic tree constructed from alignments ( <ref type="figure">Figure S1B</ref>) of 25 Npc2-like proteins (see Materials and Methods). Oscarella carmela, a sponge, served as the outgroup, and the single human Npc2 protein, the single mouse Npc2 protein, and one of the eight Drosophila melanogaster Npc2 proteins were included in the analysis. The cnidarian sequences included are from two corals (Acropora digitifera and Montastraea faveolata), three anemones (Aiptasia sp., Nematostella vectensis, and Anemonia viridis), and a hydrozoan (Hydra magnipapillata). The Npc2-encoding transcripts found to be upregulated in symbiotic anemones, which fall outside the clade containing the mammalian and Drosophila sequences, are shown in red with their foldchanges ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7,</ref>  downregulated transcripts encoding glutamate dehydrogenases <ref type="figure">(Figure 4)</ref>, which normally catabolize glutamate to a-ketoglutarate and ammonium in animal cells (where the concentrations of ammonium are typically too low to allow the reverse reaction to proceed effectively). The subcellular localization program WoLF PSORT <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Horton et al. 2007)</ref> predicts that the downregulated and upregulated enzymes should localize to the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively, consistent with a previous report that corals contain both mitochondrial and cytosolic glutamate dehydrogenases <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dudler et al. 1987)</ref>. It seems likely that these initially rather puzzling observations (upregulation of one glutamate dehydrogenase and downregulation of another; upregulation of enzymes both of glutamate synthesis and of glutamate breakdown) reflect the differing metabolic needs of different cell types, and/or of different compartments within the same cells, in symbiotic anemones.</p><p>We also observed multiple changes in the expression of genes governing the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids and the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) cycle ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Based on the failure to find a gene encoding cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) in the A. digitifera genome, it was hypothesized that cysteine is an essential amino acid in cnidarians that must be obtained directly from either prey or the symbiont <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Shinzato et al. 2011)</ref>. However, we found an Aiptasia transcript encoding a CBS (best BLAST hit, rabbit CBS, Q9N0V7; E-value 9e2166), suggesting that anthozoans resemble other animals in their ability to synthesize cysteine from methionine. The CBS transcript was downregulated 2.1-fold in symbiotic anemones, perhaps reflecting a decreased need for cysteine synthesis in the host because it is being supplied directly by the dinoflagellate. Conceivably in more obligately symbiotic corals, the enzyme is never needed and the gene has been lost altogether. It should also be noted that cysteine synthesis via the CBS pathway is a drain on the homocysteine pool, which otherwise remains available for the synthesis of methionine and the SAM cycle. The concordant upregulation of four genes encoding enzymes of the SAM cycle ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) suggests that it may assume an increased importance in symbiotic animals, although the very wide range of possible methylation targets makes it difficult to guess at the precise biological significance of this regulation. The apparent switch of pathways used for synthesis of methionine from homocysteine ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) may also reflect an alteration in the kinetics and/or localization of the SAM cycle.</p><p>Interestingly, despite the presence of a CBS, we could not find a gene(s) encoding aspartokinase or homoserine dehydrogenase in the transcriptomes of symbiotic or aposymbiotic Aiptasia or in the A. digitifera genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Shinzato et al. 2011)</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table S5</ref>, lines 15-17), implying that anthozoans would be unable to achieve a net synthesis of homoserine (and hence of homocysteine and other sulfur-containing amino acids) from central metabolic intermediates. If confirmed, this would be consistent with the situation in other animals (in which <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> Expression changes of genes governing b-oxidation of fatty acids. The diagram (adapted from Houten and Wanders 2010) shows the localization of proteins involved in fatty-acid transport and b-oxidation in relation to the membranes of the mitochondrion and cell (as known from other animal cells). Statistically significant expression changes from RNA-Seq experiment 1 are shown when applicable; upregulation in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic anemones is shown by positive/red numbers, and downregulation is shown by negative/blue numbers.

A related puzzle is that the Aiptasia transcriptome and the A. digitifera genome appear to contain genes encoding both a homoserine O-acetyltransferase and a cystathionine g-synthase, which would allow the synthesis of cystathionine from homoserine ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>), but not a cystathionine b-lyase, which in many microorganisms is responsible for the synthesis of homocysteine from cystathionine <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table  S5,</ref>  <ref type="bibr">lines 18-20)</ref>. Further studies will be needed to resolve these issues.</p><p>These questions about methionine and cysteine metabolism raised a broader question about the degree to which the amino-acidbiosynthetic capabilities of anthozoans resemble those of bettercharacterized animals, in which 12 of the 20 amino acids needed for protein synthesis cannot be synthesized from central-pathway intermediates and so must be obtained (directly or indirectly) from the diet. To address this question, we asked if the elements of aminoacid-biosynthetic pathways were present in the Aiptasia transcriptome. As expected, it appears that Aiptasia should be able to synthesize the eight generally nonessential amino acids from intermediates in the central metabolic pathways <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table S5,</ref>  <ref type="figure">lines 1, 2, 22-36)</ref>. In addition, like other animals, they should be able to synthesize arginine from ornithine via the urea cycle <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table S5</ref>, lines 37-42), although a net synthesis of ornithine and arginine would not be possible because of the apparent lack of either an acetylglutamate kinase or an ornithine acetyltransferase <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table S5</ref>, lines 43 and 44). Similarly, although the Aiptasia transcriptome revealed genes encoding various enzymes involved in interconversions within other groups of amino acids, key enzymes needed to synthesize these groups of amino acids from central-pathway intermediates appear to be missing <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table S5,</ref>  <ref type="bibr">lines 15-17, 45-79)</ref>. Thus, Aiptasia, like other animals, apparently must obtain 12 amino acids (or their amino-acid precursors) from their food, their dinoflagellate symbionts, or both. This conclusion is generally compatible with radiolabeling studies suggesting that leucine, isoleucine, valine, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine are all translocated from the dinoflagellates to the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Wang and Douglas 1999)</ref>.</p></div>

Among the groups of genes identified in this way were three that are potentially involved in the animal host's tolerance of the symbiotic dinoflagellates.</p><p>Response to oxidative stress: Because the presence of an intracellular photosynthetic symbiont presumably imposes oxidative stress on an animal host (see Discussion), it was quite surprising that of the eight differentially expressed genes identified under this GO term, six (including a catalase gene) were actually downregulated in symbiotic animals ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6A</ref>). Moreover, one of the two upregulated genes encodes a predicted guanylate cyclase, which may have many functions unrelated to oxidative stress. The other upregulated gene is one of a pair encoding distinct Aiptasia proteins ( <ref type="figure">Figure S2A</ref>) that had a human peroxidasin as their top blastx hit <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">(Table S6</ref>, section A). However, a function for these proteins in coping with oxidative stress is doubtful for two reasons. First, the second gene is downregulated in symbiotic animals ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6A</ref>). Second, despite the blastx results, neither of the Aiptasia proteins contains the peroxidase domain found in canonical peroxidasins with peroxidase activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Nelson et al. 1994)</ref> ( <ref type="figure">Figure S2, A and B)</ref> Inflammation, tissue remodeling, and response to wounding: Of the 15 differentially expressed genes associated with this cluster of GO terms, eight were downregulated and seven were upregulated in symbiotic animals ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6B</ref>).

The pattern appears even stronger when it is noted that one of the three upregulated genes with a putatively pro-inflammatory function encodes just one of at least three distinct Aiptasia plasma-kallikrein homologs ( <ref type="figure">Figure S2C</ref>), the other two of which are downregulated ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6B)</ref>, and that the upregulated ficolin may function specifically in recognition of Symbiodinium (Logan et al. 2010) rather than just as a general activator of the complement innate-immunity pathway.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>To explore the cellular and molecular basis of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, we undertook a global analysis of the transcriptomes of symbiotic and aposymbiotic Aiptasia. This study has yielded (1) extensive transcriptome assemblies that should be of great value for a wide variety of future studies; (2) testable hypotheses about changes in metabolism and metabolite transport that may occur in the host on symbiosis establishment; and (3) novel information and hypotheses about genes that may be involved in symbiont recognition and tolerance by the host. The transcriptomes also provide a reference for future studies of gene expression under other conditions such as exposure to various stresses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transcriptome assembly and annotation</head><p>We have sequenced, assembled, and partially characterized the transcriptomes of both a clonal stock of symbiotic Aiptasia and the endogenous clade A symbionts present in that stock; this same stock was also used in previous, less extensive transcriptome studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Sunagawa et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lehnert et al. 2012)</ref>. The animal and algal transcripts were separated bioinformatically using the TopSort algorithm, which we developed for this purpose, and comparisons to genomic sequence obtained from fully aposymbiotic animals. Although the assemblies appear to be of high quality overall, there remain some areas where improvements could be made. For example, it remains unclear both why reads from some genes assembled into multiple contigs that clustered based on regions of nucleotide identity (up to 230 contigs in a cluster) and why a few accession numbers have so many representative transcripts aligning to them. Because it seems unlikely that alternative splicing and gene duplications alone could explain the magnitude of the effects observed, we presume that they result from some combination of these factors and the inherent complexities of de novo transcriptome assembly. For example, two of the contig clusters with the most members encode putative actins and olfactory C proteins. In most animals, actins are encoded by families of genes and expressed at high levels, whereas olfactory C proteins are members of very large gene families. Highly abundant transcripts may have some error-containing reads that recur with sufficient frequency that they are assembled into distinct contigs, and gene families with many members could generate chimeric contigs if they have identical subsequences that are longer than the k-mers used for assembly. In addition, templates derived from more than one gene may arise during the reverse-transcription or PCR steps of library preparation; the resulting fusion reads may lead to incorrect assembly of contigs, as well as increase the proportion of such contigs substantially when the Oases merge function is used [from 3.6% to 12.2% in one reported case <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Chu et al. 2013)</ref>]. The question about accession numbers can perhaps be explained by similar mechanisms. One approach that might help with these problems would be to assemble the reads initially with a greater k-mer length and coverage cutoff to obtain fewer misassemblies for the most abundant transcripts and gene families, remove the reads that map to these transcripts, and then assemble the remaining lower-coverage reads with less stringent thresholds.</p><p>The assemblies could also be improved by investigating more closely the contigs for which the species of origin could not be determined with the methods used to date. To this end, the performance of TopSort could probably be improved in one or more of several ways. First, it could be retrained with a new dataset that includes transcriptome or genome sequence from an axenic clade A Symbiodinium strain (to improve recognition of contigs from the clade A strain resident in Aiptasia stock CC7). Second, it could be extended such that it assigns contigs not just to the four groups used to date (cnidarian, dinoflagellate, fungi, and bacteria) but also to other groups (such as diatoms and ciliates) that may be present in nontrivial amounts in the guts and/or mucous layers of the anemones; this would also require retraining with a dataset that included unequivocal sequences from those groups. Third, the classification metrics could be extended to include other sequence features found to be specific to the phyla of interest [such as the spliced leader sequences thought to be present in many dinoflagellate transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Zhang et al. 2007)</ref>]. In addition to improving the performance of TopSort, its assignments could also be tested further using alignment to transcriptome or genome sequence from a clonal, axenic Symbiodinium strain (preferably of clade A), essentially as we have already done using Aiptasia genome sequence. Ultimately, however, some contigs may remain ambiguous in assignment until assembled genomes of both partner organisms are available for alignment.</p><p>Several additional issues will require further investigation as the relevant resources become available. First, the numbers of unigenes found here for both symbiotic partners ($14,000 by conservative estimate) are significantly less than those expected for the full genomes. For Symbiodinium, this probably reflects, at least in part, the existence of many genes that are expressed at significant levels only in free-living and/or stressed organisms. For Aiptasia, it presumably reflects the absence in the current transcriptome of genes that are expressed at significant levels only in specialized and nonabundant cell types (e.g., in nerve and muscle), at other stages in development (e.g., in embryos and larvae), or under other environmental conditions. Second, only 62% and 74% of representative Aiptasia transcripts could be annotated using the SwissProt and nr databases, respectively, and these numbers were even lower (35% and 49%) for Symbiodinium. This incomplete annotation presumably reflects the poor representation in the databases of genes and proteins unique to these relatively understudied organisms, as well as the great phylogenetic distance of the dinoflagellates from more intensively studied groups. Finally, the Symbiodinium transcriptome reported here has not yet been analyzed in depth. However, we should soon be able to use this transcriptome to make interesting comparisons of gene expression in this Symbiodinium strain growing in culture vs. in hospite, in this strain after exposure to various stressors, and in different Symbiodinium strains grown in this same host, as well as to make informative comparisons to the genomic and transcriptomic sequences that are currently becoming available for other Symbiodinium types <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bayer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Shoguchi et al. 2013)</ref>.</p></div>

Because mammalian GLUT8 is localized to the endosome membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Augustin et al. 2005)</ref>, it is likely that one or both of the Aiptasia GLUT8 orthologs localize to the symbiosome membrane ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7A</ref>), a hypothesis that should be readily testable by immunolocalization studies once appropriate antibodies are available. The putative Na + -glucose/myo-inositol co-transporter might also be involved in glucose transport across the symbiosome membrane. It should be noted that there must also be a Symbiodinium protein that transports large amounts of glucose into the symbiosome lumen ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7B)</ref>; it should be possible to identify the corresponding gene(s) among those expressed differentially in Symbiodinium cells growing in hospite relative to those growing in culture.</p><p>Possible glucose transport between cells: To our knowledge, there is currently no information regarding whether and how the gastrodermal cells provide energy to the epidermal cells, cells in the mesoglea, and gastrodermal cells that lack dinoflagellates and/or access to nutrients from the gastric cavity, and regarding whether these modes of nourishment change on establishment of symbiosis. Nourishment of the epidermal cells is a major issue because these cells neither contain dinoflagellates nor have direct access to food, but they presumably require large amounts of energy for maintenance, reproduction, nematocyst replacement, and mucus production [which is extensive and has been reported to consume as much as 40% of the energy available to corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Crossland et al. 1980)</ref>]. Thus, one or more of the upregulated glucose transporters might be found in the basolateral membranes of the gastrodermal cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7, C and D)</ref>, the basolateral membranes of the epidermal cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7E</ref>), or both. These questions should be resolvable by immunolocalization experiments and/or experiments in which gene expression is evaluated in separated tissue layers <ref type="bibr">(Ganot et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Fatty-acid metabolism and transport: Our previous study of the transfer of fixed carbon from the dinoflagellates to the host was more comprehensive in its evaluation of polar than of nonpolar compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Burriesci et al. 2012)</ref>. Thus, it is conceivable that the upregulation of genes encoding proteins of fatty-acid metabolism and transport reflects a significant role of fatty acids in this transfer ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7F</ref>). Importantly, however, (1) we saw upregulation of genes of both fattyacid synthesis and fatty-acid breakdown (suggesting that gastrodermal and epidermal cells may be behaving differently) and (2) in most animals, high levels of glucose (such as those expected in the cytoplasm of gastrodermal cells harboring dinoflagellates) inhibit b-oxidation and stimulate fatty-acid synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Randle 1998)</ref>. Thus, we think it more likely that gastrodermal cells synthesize fatty acids from the glucose provided by the dinoflagellates during the day ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7G</ref>), store them in neutral fats or wax esters <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Crossland et al. 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Harland et al. 1993)</ref>, and subsequently mobilize them to serve as an energy supply at night and/or for transfer into the mesoglea ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7H</ref>) and thence into the epidermal cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7I</ref>). The epidermal cells would metabolize the fatty acids by b-oxidation ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7J</ref>) to provide energy and acetyl-CoA building blocks. The apparent upregulation of the glyoxylate cycle <ref type="figure">(Figure 7K</ref>) (see Results) would be explained by the need of the epidermal cells to synthesize carbohydrates, amino acids, and other compounds from acetyl-CoA. Testing of these hypotheses should be possible by immunolocalization of the relevant proteins, in situ mRNA hybridization, and/or examination of gene expression in separated gastrodermal and epidermal tissue layers.</p><p>Transport of sterols as building blocks and/or symbiosis signals: A previous study showed that the anemone A. viridis has at least two genes encoding Npc2-like proteins, one of which is in a subfamily <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> Summary of hypotheses about metabolism and metabolite transport as suggested by the gene expression data and previously available information.

Not shown because of their potential complexity are the other changes in inorganic-nutrient transport (e.g., a damping of NH 4 + and CO 2 excretion across the apical plasma membranes of the gastrodermal cells) that are likely to occur upon the onset of symbiosis. All of these hypotheses should be testable through a combination of experiments including protein localization by immunofluorescence and/or cell fractionation, studies of separated gastrodermal and epidermal cell layers, sterol-binding experiments on Npc2 proteins, and others. See text for additional details.</p><p>distinct from that of the mammalian and Drosophila Npc2 proteins and was upregulated in symbiotic gastrodermal tissue <ref type="bibr">(Ganot et al. 2011)</ref>. We have confirmed and extended these findings by showing that Aiptasia and several other cnidarians also contain multiple genes encoding Npc2-like proteins. In a phylogenetic analysis, one of the Aiptasia proteins clustered with the mammalian and Drosophila proteins and shares with them key residues implicated in cholesterol binding. Four other Aiptasia proteins, including the one whose transcript is massively upregulated in symbiotic anemones (Npc2D), belong to a separate subfamily that also contains the upregulated A. viridis Npc2D; members of this subfamily do not share the residues implicated in cholesterol binding ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B)</ref>. In contrast, we identified only one Aiptasia gene encoding an unequivocal Npc1-like protein; its expression did not change between aposymbiotic and symbiotic animals. These observations suggest the following speculative model ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7L)</ref>. A Symbiodinium-encoded sterol transporter (e.g., an Npc1-like protein) is present in the dinoflagellate plasma membrane and passes one or more dinoflagellate-synthesized sterols to the Aiptasia-encoded Npc2D, which is localized specifically to the symbiosome lumen. Npc2D in turn passes the sterol(s) to the Aiptasiaencoded Npc1 in the symbiosome membrane, which passes them to a sterol-carrier protein in the cytosol. If the same Npc1 protein functions in different membranes, in concert with all of the different Npc2 partners, and in other cell types as well as gastrodermal cells containing dinoflagellates, then this could explain why its transcript is not significantly upregulated upon the onset of symbiosis.</p><p>The model to this point is agnostic about what sterols might be transferred, and to what end(s), but these are also important questions. The membranes of Aiptasia, like those of other animals, presumably contain cholesterol as an essential component. This cholesterol could be obtained from food, by de novo synthesis, or by modification of one or more of the distinctive, non-cholesterol sterols (dinosterol, gorgosterols) produced in large quantities by many dinoflagellates (but not by other marine algae that have been investigated) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Giner and Wikfors 2011)</ref>. Based on its sequence ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B)</ref>, Aiptasia Npc2A seems the most likely to be involved in cholesterol traffic per se, whereas Npc2D (and Npc2B, Npc2C, and Npc2E: <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>) might all be involved in traffic of various other dinoflagellate-produced sterols. The latter might serve only as precursors of cholesterol, but a more intriguing possibility is that one or more of these molecules serves as the signal that a symbiosis-compatible dinoflagellate is present in the phagosome/symbiosome.</p><p>Although the model of <ref type="figure">Figure 7L</ref> is speculative, it is important to note that its major features should be testable by experiments that include (1) localization to the gastrodermal and/or epidermal cell layers of the expression of the several genes, (2) protein localization by immunofluorescence and/or cell fractionation, (3) using purified, labeled sterols to test the binding specificities of bacterially expressed Npc2 proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ko et al. 2003)</ref>, and (4) tests of the abilities of exogenously added Npc2 proteins to complement the loss-of-cholesteroltransport phenotype in NPC2-knockout human cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Ko et al. 2003)</ref>. It is also worth noting that if this model is correct, Npc2D proteins would become an invaluable marker for the isolation of intact (i.e., nonruptured) symbiosomes.</p><p>Transport and metabolism of inorganic nutrients and the coordination of nitrogen and carbon metabolism: It is clear that symbiotic cnidarians must transport CO , NH 4 + , and other inorganic nutrients across the symbiosome membrane-and indeed concentrate at least some of these materials within the symbiosome lumen-to provide their resident dinoflagellates with these essential building blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Pernice et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bertucci et al. 2013)</ref>. Thus, at least some of the many inorganic-nutrient transporters and transport-related proteins that are upregulated in symbiotic anemones (see Results) are presumably localized to the symbiosome membrane or lumen ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7M</ref>). However, it seems virtually certain that the onset of symbiosis also induces changes in inorganic-nutrient transport across the various plasma-membrane domains. For example, aposymbiotic anemones presumably excrete CO 2 and NH 4 + across the apical membranes of both epidermal and gastrodermal cells, whereas symbiotic anemones presumably reduce such excretion at least from the gastrodermal cells, and may even achieve a net uptake of both compounds from the environment. Although the possibilities are too numerous and too complicated for ready depiction in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, determining the cellular (gastrodermal, epidermal, or both) and intracellular (symbiosome membrane, apical plasma membrane, basolateral plasma membrane, and/or other) localizations of the differentially regulated transporters and transport-related proteins should begin to answer many of these questions with a clarity that has not been possible before.</p><p>The changes in NH + movement upon symbiosis establishment also bear on the probable linkage between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In this regard, two non-mutually exclusive models have been put forward. The "nitrogen-recycling model" focuses on the possibility that continued host catabolism of amino acids produces NH 4 + that is supplied to the dinoflagellate, which in turn releases amino acids for use by the host <ref type="figure">(Figure 7N</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cates and McLaughlin 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Szmant-Froelich and Pilson 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wang and Douglas 1998)</ref>. In contrast, the "nitrogen-conservation model" focuses on the possibility that the fixed carbon provided by the dinoflagellate leads to a suppression of host amino-acid catabolism and therefore of the generation of NH + to be used by the dinoflagellate or excreted <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Rees 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Rees and Ellard 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Wang and Douglas 1998)</ref>. Our data provide support for aspects of both models. In particular, we observed upregulation of the genes of the GS-GOGAT cycle (the first dedicated step of NH 4 + assimilation in animals) in symbiotic anemones, indicating that the release of metabolites from the dinoflagellate promoted synthesis, rather than catabolism, of some amino acids. ( Ãƒ The simultaneous upregulation of a presumably catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase might be taken as countervailing evidence, but this observation is difficult to interpret without knowing in which cell type(s) and cytoplasmic compartment(s) this upregulation occurs.) Meanwhile, we also obtained strong support for previous evidence that cnidarians, like other animals, can only synthesize eight of the 20 amino acids found in proteins from intermediates of the central metabolic pathways. The remaining 12 amino acids must thus be obtained either from food or from the dinoflagellates, and our observation that the host genes for at least nine amino-acid transporters are upregulated in symbiotic anemones (see Results) suggests strongly that the dinoflagellates indeed contribute to the host'samino acid supply. It should be informative to determine the localizations and amino-acid specificities of these host-encoded transporters as well as to identify any amino-acid transporters expressed differentially by Symbiodinium during growth in hospite (because it is unlikely that free-living dinoflagellates would export amino acids into the surrounding sea water).</p><p>Recognition and tolerance of dinoflagellate symbionts by the host Establishment and maintenance of the mutualistic relationship also require that the host recognize and tolerate the dinoflagellate symbionts. Thus, it was not surprising that an unbiased screen for functional groups that were enriched among the differentially expressed genes revealed three groups that might be involved in these processes, as discussed below.</p><p>Response to oxidative stress: Both a priori logic and considerable experimental evidence support the view that possession of an intracellular photosynthetic symbiont imposes oxidative stress on the host, particularly under conditions in which chloroplast damage may result in enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(D'Aoust et al. 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Lesser 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lesser , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Venn et al. 2008)</ref>.

Although a catalase gene is expressed at high levels in symbiotic anemones <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Sunagawa et al. 2009</ref>, and see the RNA-Seq read counts provided in File S2 and File S3), as it is in other animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kodzius et al. 2004)</ref>, both it and most of the other differentially regulated genes in this GO category were actually downregulated in symbiotic animals, and the two that were upregulated do not seem likely to be involved in ROS detoxification (see Results). Previous studies of other species of anemones have also found host genes thought to be involved in ROS detoxification (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase) to be downregulated in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Rodriguez-Lanetty et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ganot et al. 2011)</ref>. Although other studies have indicated that symbiotic cnidarians have higher superoxide-dismutase activities than their aposymbiotic counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dykens and Shick 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Furla et al. 2005)</ref>, it was not determined whether the enzyme was of host or dinoflagellate origin. Thus, it is possible that the hosts are protected from ROS by symbiont-generated antioxidants and can reduce the expression of their own enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Rodriguez-Lanetty et al. 2006)</ref>. These other studies, like ours, were conducted under conditions thought to be nonstressful, and it is possible that a different picture would emerge under stressful conditions. In that regard, however, we have also recently observed that bleaching under heat stress can occur rapidly in the dark, when photosynthetically produced ROS cannot be present <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Tolleter et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Inflammation, tissue remodeling, and response to wounding: Inflammation is a protective tissue response to injury or pathogens that serve to destroy, dilute, and/or wall off both the injurious agent and the injured tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Sparks 1985)</ref>. In invertebrates, including anthozoans, the inflammation-like response involves both cellular and humoral aspects, including the infiltration of immune cells such as amoebocytes and granular cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Patterson and Landolt 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mydlarz et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Palmer et al. 2008)</ref>, phagocytosis and/or encapsulation of foreign material <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Patterson and Landolt 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Olano and Bigger 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Petes et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mydlarz et al. 2008)</ref>, and the production of cytotoxic molecules such as ROS, nitric oxide, lysozyme, antimicrobial peptides, and intermediates of the phenoloxidase cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Hutton and Smith 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Perez and Weis 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mydlarz et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Palmer et al. 2008)</ref>. Our data suggest that the establishment of symbiosis is associated with an overall attenuation of the inflammatory response (see Results), presumably to allow the dinoflagellate to coexist peacefully with the host rather than being attacked as a harmful invader. Other studies also support this conclusion and suggest that it may be a general feature of the means by which animal hosts accommodate symbiotic microbes. For example, when symbiotic and aposymbiotic Aiptasia were challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the former produced much less nitric oxide than did the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Detournay et al. 2012)</ref>, and in two hard-coral species with inflammatory-like responses, dinoflagellate densities were lower in the "inflamed" than in the adjacent healthy tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Palmer et al. 2008)</ref>. Similarly, successful colonization of squid light organs by symbiotic bacteria is associated with an irreversible attenuation of host nitric-oxide production <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Davidson et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Altura et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Of particular interest because of its massive upregulation in symbiotic anemones is the gene encoding scavenger receptor B class member 1 (SRB1); upregulation of SRB1 was also observed previously in symbiotic individuals of the anemone Anthopleura <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Rodriguez-Lanetty et al. 2006)</ref>. SRB1 is a member of the CD36 protein family and is a transmembrane cell-surface glycoprotein that has been implicated in multiple functions, including lipid transport <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>, <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref>, and associated text), cell adhesion, wound healing, apoptosis, and innate immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Areschoug and Gordon 2009)</ref>. Perhaps of most interest is its role in Plasmodium infection, because the apicomplexan parasites are a sister taxon to the dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baldauf 2003)</ref>. SRB1 has been shown to boost host hepatocyte permissiveness to Plasmodium infection, promote parasite development by acting as major lipid provider, and enable adhesion between Plasmodium-infected and uninfected erythrocytes, thus allowing for movement of parasites between host cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Rodrigues et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Yalaoui et al. 2008)</ref>. It is possible that SRB1 has similar functions in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, and further investigation of its function by protein localization and knockdown of function should be highly informative.</p><p>Apoptosis and cell death: The possible roles of apoptosis and necrotic cell death in the breakdown of symbiosis under stress have been investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Dunn et al. 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Dunn et al. , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dunn et al. , 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Richier et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ainsworth et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Kvitt et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Pernice et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Tchernov et al. 2011)</ref>, and a role for apoptosis in the post-phagocytic selection of compatible symbionts has also been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dunn and Weis 2009)</ref>. However, the possible role of apoptosis in maintenance of a stable symbiotic relationship has not been addressed experimentally. Others have suggested that apoptosis might contribute to the dynamic equilibrium between host and symbiont cell growth and proliferation that is presumably necessary to ensure a stable relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Muscatine and Pool 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fitt 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Davy et al. 2012)</ref>, and our observation that 13 apoptosis/cell death-related genes were differentially expressed (some massively so) in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic anemones is broadly consistent with this possibility. However, the complexity of the apoptotic pathways and the fact that a single protein can have either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic function depending on its localization and/or the presence or absence of other specific signals makes it impossible to draw firm conclusions from gene expression data alone.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is worth noting the potential role of tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) family members and their associated proteins, which are prominent regulators of cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation in both vertebrates and invertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Neumann et al. 2013)</ref>. We found a TNF-family ligand, a TNF receptor, a receptor-associated factor, and the functionally related "growth-arrest and DNA-damageinducible protein" all to be upregulated in symbiotic anemones (1.9fold, 60-fold, 1.8-fold, and 5.1-fold, respectively). These proteins are capable of inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis by at least two different pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Zhang et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Sinha and Chaudhary 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burkly et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sabour Alaoui et al. 2012)</ref>, as well as of activating the multifunctional NFkB and MAPK pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Sinha and Chaudhary 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Burkly et al. 2007)</ref>, so that they may coordinate multiple biological processes to regulate symbiotic stability. Interestingly, genes encoding TNF receptors and receptor-associated proteins were also prominent among the genes found to be upregulated in corals living under chronic mild heat stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Barshis et al. 2013)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>line 4;Ganot et al. 2011).

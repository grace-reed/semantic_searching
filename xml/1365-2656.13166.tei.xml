Spatial heterogeneity in abiotic and biotic conditions may shape such tradeoffs and accordingly alter spatial patterning of immune phenotypes. For example, spatial variation in water conductivity explained variation in innate immunity of Gammarus pulex (Cornet et al. 2009; <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Variation in abiotic conditions can also modify 190 energetic tradeoffs at large spatial scales; for example, tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) at the 191 northern limits of their geographic range showed more dramatic tradeoffs among multiple arms 192 of immunity and with reproduction than birds at their southern range limit <ref type="bibr">(Ardia 2005a</ref><ref type="bibr">(Ardia , 2007a</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>193</head><p>Biotic conditions can also impact host energetics and immune investment. As food is 194 limiting for many wildlife, resource availability is a key driver of defense (Strandin et al. 2018).</p><p>195 Whereas the allocation model predicts negative tradeoffs between immunity and costly traits, the 196 acquisition model can explain positive correlations: if hosts can acquire more resources, energy 197 can be allocated to both immunity and other costly traits (Van Noordwijk and de Jong 1986). In  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).

All rights reserved processes (i.e., changing parasite pressure and abiotic or biotic conditions) and by exposing individuals to novel stressors such as contaminants (Martin et al. 2010). Anthropogenic factors can alter parasite pressure as well as abiotic and biotic conditions, thereby indirectly shaping immunity. For example, tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in more agricultural habitats had stronger bacterial killing ability (BKA) than birds in less agricultural habitats, potentially owing to elevated parasitism (Schmitt, Garant, Bélisle, &amp; Pelletier, 2017; <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in more agricultural habitats also had stronger BKA, instead likely signaling improved defense from more food through abundant livestock prey (Becker, Czirják, Volokhov, et al. 2018; <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). Given that these similar patterns can stem from distinct environmental mechanisms, data-driven syntheses to assess how anthropogenic habitats influence immunity across spatial scales are especially needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Messina et al. 2018)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Critical appraisal of macroimmunology</head><p>Given that various spatial factors can affect immunity, spatially focused studies can help to differentiate distinct environmental mechanisms underlying such geographic patterns. Although these studies can be logistically challenging, growing macroecological efforts suggest many spatial processes can be distinguished. For example, proxies of water quality were associated with spatial variation in sea fan coral (Gorgonia ventalina) innate immunity, whereas historical 236 disease prevalence had no impact, suggesting a more dominant role of current abiotic conditions 237 in shaping host defense (Couch et al. 2008; <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). To assess the degree to which 238 macroimmunology studies can provide such inferences, we conducted a systematic review to (i)</p></div>

All rights reserved effects of these hypothesized spatial factors; and (iii) describe spatial studies according to host taxa, spatial replication and extent, immune measures, and the use of spatial statistical methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature review</head><p>We conducted systematic searches in Web of Science, PubMed, and CAB Abstracts in October 2018 using the following string: (wild*) AND ("immune defense" OR "immune response" OR "immune function" OR "immune phenotype" OR "immune profiles" OR "immunity" OR ecoimmunology) AND (environment* OR geograph* OR latitud* OR landscape* OR habitat* OR "populations" OR range* OR biotic* OR abiotic* OR anthropogo*) NOT (human* OR domestic* OR captiv* OR experiment* OR plant* OR aquacultur*). These produced 3657 studies after excluding duplicates ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. S1</ref>). We followed a systematic protocol to screen titles, abstracts, and full texts to include studies of immunology in wild systems. From the remaining 456 studies, we recorded the wildlife taxon and whether studies sampled more than one site. This sample likely represents only a subset of ecoimmunology, and we interpret results accordingly. For studies that sampled more than one site, we recorded (i) host species; (ii) number of sites; (iii) scale of analysis; (iv) immune measures; (v) whether studies assessed spatial autocorrelation and (vi) spatial variation in immunity; (vii) statistical methods; (viii) whether studies quantified spatial variation in environmental conditions and related this to immunity; (ix) individual covariates included in the spatial analysis, (x) if the study also assessed seasonality, and (xi) spatial extent. Most studies did not report extent, which we estimated using the longitude and latitude of the most distant sites with the geosphere package in R (Hijmans et al. 2017).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical approach</head><p>We used the prevalence package to estimate the prevalence of multi-site studies. To test if 264 prevalence varied across taxa, we fit a generalized linear model (GLM) with binomial errors and 265 a logit link. To test how the proportion of multi-site studies has fluctuated over time, we fit a In our dataset of only multi-site studies, we performed descriptive analyses to describe 268 the diversity of immune measures, how often studies assessed spatial variation, and what spatial 269 factors were tested. We classified immune measures into seven categories: antigen challenge 270 (e.g., in vivo and in vitro), functional defense (e.g., microbial killing assays), immune cells (e.g., leukocyte counts), immune genes (e.g., individual expression, MHC), immune organs (e.g., spleen mass, bursa of Fabricius), immune proteins (e.g., acute phase, immunoglobulins), and other (e.g., reactive oxygen species). We also assessed whether studies measured innate or adaptive immunity and used χ 2 tests to assess whether measures were distributed differentially across taxa. We also estimated the proportion of multi-site studies that assessed spatial variation in immunity, using another χ 2 test to quantify how these spatial factors varied across taxa. We next restricted analyses to studies reporting the number of sites sampled. We used the fitdistr package to fit four distributions to the number of sites per study to assess skew in spatial sampling efforts (Delignette-Muller and Dutang 2014). We used Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the appropriate error distribution to next use in a GLM testing how spatial replication varied with taxa (Burnham and Anderson 2002). We lastly tested whether spatial replication scaled positively with spatial extent, which would suggest that sampling efforts match study scale (Wiens 1989). We log 10 -transformed spatial extent as our response, included the number of sites as the predictor, and compared three models: a linear model, a linear model with a quadratic term, and a linear model with log-transformed number of sites (i.e., a log-log model).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emerging methodological patterns</head><p>Of the 456 ecoimmunology studies from our literature sample, 210 assessed immune variation across multiple sites (46%, 95% CI: 42% to 51%). This proportion varied by taxa (χ 2 =16.70, 290 p&lt;0.01), with fish having more multi-site studies (67%) than birds (40%; z=3.41, p&lt;0.01) or 291 mammals (43%; z=3.03, p=0.01; <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A</ref>). The proportion of multi-site studies showed no annual 292 change (χ 2 =0.17, p=0.68; <ref type="figure">Fig. 2B</ref>). Therefore, although spatial approaches have been fairly 293 common within ecoimmunology, their use has varied across taxa and been constant over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>294</head><p>The most common immune measures were immune genes, immune cells, antigen 295 challenge, and immune proteins; 32% of studies used assays from multiple categories (67/210).</p><p>p&lt;0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 3A)</ref>; mammal studies were more likely to assay immune genes and organs, bird studies were more likely to assay immune cells and proteins, bird and mammal studies were more likely to use antigen challenge, and the rare assays that describe functional defense were evenly distributed ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 3A)</ref>.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3C</ref>). Thus, whereas multi-site studies often examined spatial patterns in immunity and tested environmental predictors of this variation, rarely did they test multiple spatial hypotheses. To assess if this could be an issue of statistical power, we next quantified spatial replication and tested whether this matched spatial extent. The degree of spatial replication was best described using a Gamma distribution (w i =1.00; <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>) with a long right tail and a median of four sites <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig. 4A)</ref>. A GLM with Gamma-distributed errors showed that spatial replication did not vary across taxa (χ 2 =4.12, p=0.39; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 4B</ref>). We tested whether spatial extent scaled positively with the spatial extents of our studies <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig. 4C</ref>). For the 157 studies where extent was reported or could be derived, a loglog model was supported over a linear term for spatial replication (w i =0.56), whereas a quadratic term was only marginally supported (ΔAIC=1.79; <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>). The log-log model showed that spatial extent was positively associated with spatial replication (F 1,155 =4.95, p=0.03), denoting a power law relationship. The slope was less than one (β=0.87), suggesting that the effect of spatial replication on spatial extent weakens at large scales <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig. 4D</ref>). This pattern was replicated by the</p></div>

This result implies that studies with few sites match their spatial 329 extent. However, studies with larger extents did not display a similar increase in spatial 330 replication, suggesting limited ability to infer how environment shapes immunity (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>331</head><p>Most macroimmunology studies assessed data at the individual scale (64%), with fewer 332 studies operating at the scale of sites (e.g., aggregating individual data; 24%) or using both scales 333 (12%). These scales were differentially distributed across taxa (χ 2 =16.74, p=0.03), with mammal and bird studies more often assessing individual variation ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5A</ref>). Only four studies assessed spatial autocorrelation ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5B</ref>; all with Mantel tests of isolation by distance). Only 20% of studies controlled for pseudoreplication by site (43/210); this was consistent across taxa (χ 2 =5.63, p=0.24; <ref type="figure">Fig. 5C</ref>). Most of these 43 studies (58%) included site as a fixed effect. Only 30% used site as a random effect in a mixed model (GLMM; 13/43), and only 12% used spatial statistical models. These statistical methods did not vary across taxa (χ 2 =13.06, p=0.12; <ref type="figure">Fig. 5D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spatial statistical methods for ecoimmunology</head><p>In addition to detecting generally low spatial replication in macroimmunology, these descriptive analyses highlight the rarity of quantifying spatial autocorrelation and controlling for spatial dependence. We here describe tools from geostatistics and spatial analysis to assess and control for spatial variation and to guide future spatial sampling designs. Because the application of statistical methods to infectious disease data has been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Pullan et al.</p><p>2012), we highlight concepts and tools more specific to ecoimmunology than to epidemiology. Ecoimmunology data are mostly continuous sources of spatial variation at the individual scale rather than at discrete spatial units; binary data (e.g., resistant genotypes) are also possible. to quantify if similarity in immunity between sites is predicted by inter-site distance <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5B</ref>).</p><p>Semivariograms can also provide more precise estimates of spatial dependence (Goovaerts 1997). Semivariance (the dissimilarity between observations) increases with distance until a maximum value is obtained (i.e., the sill); the corresponding inter-site distance is the estimated "range" of spatial dependence, which can indicate the spatial scale of environmental drivers. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future directions for macroimmunology</head><p>Our synthesis illustrates the growing interest in macroimmunology and assessing spatial variation in wildlife defense. However, our results also suggest the field is in its early stages with much room to expand. Although spatial approaches to ecoimmunology are common, spatial replication is low overall, especially for large-scale studies. This limits the ability of such studies to capture the broad environmental variation required for macroecology (Wiens 1989), and underpowered analyses linking spatial covariates with immunity may risk false negatives (e.g., <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 1</ref>). Most studies do not control for spatial dependence, which can risk false positives (e.g., underestimating standard errors). Moreover, not characterizing spatial dependence is a missed opportunity to develop data-driven hypotheses and sampling designs. More generally, whereas ecoimmunology research on species-level heterogeneity has begun to integrate across studies</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Author Manuscript</head><p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved To direct future studies in macroimmunology, we lastly outline research questions that are especially well poised to answer through spatial approaches, provide methodological recommendations for addressing such questions, and outline macroecological approaches for conducting the broad data syntheses required to assess generalizable patterns. Given the broad taxonomic representation of studies included in our synthesis, we focus this primarily on birds and mammals. These taxa had greater numbers of multi-site studies, were especially well-studied for anthropogenic change, and their studies were more likely to assess spatial variation in immunity and control for spatial dependence. In particular, we draw from work on passerines and rodents, which have several advantageous characteristics <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6</ref>). Their small body sizes mean that many species are easy to live capture, their small home ranges allow many site replicates, and their broad geographic ranges facilitate obtaining high environmental variation  <ref type="table">(Table S3)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Priority areas for future research</head><p>As highlighted in our critical appraisal, most studies that assessed spatial variation in immunity did so through anthropogenic or purely spatial gradients. Within these factors, we focus on three priority questions posed early in this review: does immunity follow biogeographic patterns, how do range expansions affect defense, and does urbanization have consistent impacts on immune phenotypes? Such topics are united in dealing with large spatial scales and integrating several</p></div>

Alongside quantifying spatial parasite diversity, future studies on the macroecology of tolerance would also benefit from assessing spatial variation in parasite load (Burgan, Gervasi, Johnson, et al. 2018).</p><p>Additionally, validations of biomarkers for these traits can facilitate more direct interpretations of how defense varies spatially. For example, a captive study of house sparrows exposed to West Nile virus assessed whether resistance or tolerance could be predicted with cytokines. Higher A common garden study of individuals from the core and latitudinal edge populations could further assess the degree to which observed differences represent genetic variation or phenotypic plasticity. In such an approach, prior work on house sparrows showed that immune differences between two temperate and tropical house sparrow populations persisted in captivity, suggesting that latitudinal variation reflects more than acclimation to different habitats <ref type="bibr">(Martin et al. 2004)</ref>.</p></div>

Longitudinal studies could establish tolerance differences between habitat contrasts (e.g., recapture rates of infected hosts), while captive studies could use parasite challenge to test for fitness effects between populations (Corby-Harris and Promislow 2008).</p></div>

Hosts are exposed to spatial variation in contaminants by proximity to point (e.g., refineries) and nonpoint (e.g., agricultural runoff) sources, in turn generating spatial variation in immunity. For example, tree swallows breeding in mercury-contaminated habitats exhibited weaker immune responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) challenge than birds in reference habitats (Hawley et al. 2009), and Algerian mice (Mus spretus) sampled from a polluted site showed distinct immune gene expression relative to mice from uncontaminated habitats (Ruiz-Laguna et al. 2016).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Prior to hypothesis tests of how environmental variation shapes immunity, quantifying continuous spatial dependence can provide important insights about the spatial scale at which such effects occur (Diniz-Filho et al. 2003). While immunity can be compared between discrete sites or populations, spatial dependence can be characterized with global and local measures of autocorrelation. Global Moran's I varies from -1 to 1, from perfectly dispersed to perfectly clustered spatial data (Moran 1950). Spatial correlograms can further help estimate local autocorrelation as a function of inter-site distance (Koenig and Knops 1998). The shape of the correlogram can provide insight into the environmental processes generating the spatial pattern Author Manuscript This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved (Legendre and Fortin 1989). Correlograms often show a linear or exponential decline with increasing distance, suggesting a highly localized spatial mechanism. Recent work on red deer (Cervus elaphus) illustrates such fine-scale autocorrelation and suggests that environmental processes can shape defense within even an individual's home range (Albery et al. 2018). In contrast, correlograms applied to vampire bat leukocytes demonstrated autocorrelation at broad scales (thousands of kilometers), suggesting that conditions of the latitudinal range margins were more important determinants of immunity than local predictors (Becker, Nachtmann, et al. 2019). Whereas our sample had no analyses that used correlograms, studies did use Mantel tests</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head>(</head><label></label><figDesc>Lindstedt et al. 1986; Hasselquist 2007). Immunological resources from domestic birds and laboratory rodents can also facilitate comparative work, although translating these reagents to wild species is not without its challenges (Martinez et al. 2003; Pedersen and Babayan 2011). Many passerines and rodents are common in anthropogenic habitats and are reservoirs for zoonotic and economically important parasites, which is relevant for linking environmental change, immunity, and spillover (Reed et al. 2003; Han et al. 2016). Studies of passerines and rodents generally had spatial replication above the study-level median (Fig. 6), with species such as the tree swallow, great tit (Parus major), house finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), house mouse (Mus musculus), bank vole (Myodes glareolus), and field vole (Microtus agrestis) being especially well-represented in our sample</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>and macroecological data synthesis. Latitudinal studies of immunity have held particular appeal for ecoimmunology, offering potential for simple laws in patterns of host resistance (Hasselquist 2007; Morand et al. 2010). Approaches have included studying closely related species pairs across latitudes (Møller 1998) to field studies of several temperate and tropical populations (Ardia 2005b; Martin et al. 2006; Owen-Ashley et al. 2008; Adelman et al. 2010). These patterns have been well-studied in passerines, for which birds closer to the equator tend to show stronger humoral but not cellmediated immunity (Hasselquist 2007). Rodents have been relatively understudied, with latitude being a less consistent predictor of defense (Pyter et al. 2005; Morand et al. 2010). An outstanding hypothesis is whether such latitudinal gradients reflect latitudinal gradients in parasitism.Although past work has found distinct immune phenotypes between temperate and tropical populations, such differences can stem from spatial gradients not only in parasitism but also in breeding phenology, life history, or abiotic conditions. For example, vampire bats from their latitudinal range limits had high ratios of heterophils to lymphocytes, in contrast to the prediction that these would indicate elevated inflammation close to the equator due to higher parasite risks (Becker, Nachtmann, et al. 2019). In many systems, latitudinal variation in parasitism remains to be tested (Hasselquist 2007; Morand et al. 2010), while other studies find infection to be higher at range limits (e.g.,Briers 2003)  or demonstrate inconsistent patterns with latitude that may reflect transmission mode (Lindenfors et al. 2007; Clark 2018; Dallas et al. 2018). More extensive spatial sampling efforts alongside assessment of parasite pressure could help differentiate the importance of parasite gradients from other environmental factors. Range expansions and biological invasions are another priority for macroimmunology. Immunity can not only facilitate the success of species introductions but also determine whether invasive individuals are more likely to serve as reservoir hosts for novel (i.e., spillover) or native (i.e., spillback) parasites (Lee and Klasing 2004; Kelly et al. 2009). Various hypotheses have been proposed for drivers of variation in immunity across an invasion, including that introduced hosts may exhibit damped inflammatory responses given high energetic costs of this defense and greater investment in reproduction, that hosts in more recently established populations should instead invest more in humoral immunity given possibly elevated parasite risks, and that founder events during expansions could lead to reduced genetic diversity and weaker defense (Lee andAuthor ManuscriptThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reservedKlasing 2004; Travis et al. 2007). Such hypotheses can be most readily assessed through comparing immunity across a gradient of recently established and native range populations. Work on passerines and rodents has facilitated several tests of these ideas. Invasive house mice and black rats (Rattus rattus) in Senegal display stronger natural antibody responses and higher inflammatory responses compared to those in more established populations, suggesting that greater parasite exposure at the invasion front drives immunity (Diagne et al. 2017). Similarly, inflammation has likely mitigated invasion success of house sparrows in Kenya; the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 is higher in range-edge birds than birds closer to the site of introduction (Martin et al. 2014, 2015). Whether such patterns arise from protective effects of TLR expression, the propensity of high TLR expression to mitigate the costs of immunity, or a balance of both processes remains an area of active investigation (Martin et al. 2017). Spatial sampling across more geographic and taxonomically diverse systems where range expansions occur will facilitate assessing any general associations between invasions and immune defense. Lastly, urban-rural gradients offer several opportunities for macroimmunology. Although many aspects of urbanization can shape immunity (French et al. 2018; Ouyang et al. 2018), the availability of anthropogenic resources has received increasing attention (Becker et al. 2015; Altizer et al. 2018). Spatial studies of passerines suggest that urban (and suburban) habitats with supplemental food are associated with lower ratios of heterophils to lymphocytes and greater microbicidal ability (Wilcoxen et al. 2015). Similarly, anthropogenic food may more broadly increase both innate and adaptive defenses (Strandin et al. 2018). Such patterns are consistent with predictions from the acquisition model, where access to more resources can result in allocating energy to immune functions with differing costs (Van Noordwijk and de Jong 1986), which may likewise explain patterns of general upregulation of immune response in urban great tits and other passerine species (Fokidis et al. 2008; Watson et al. 2017). The acquisition model may also explain how urbanized species can obtain high population densities alongside such immunological differences, if urbanized hosts can invest more in both defense and reproduction (Oro et al. 2013). Spatial studies of urbanization can also test how defense differs between island and mainland populations. Passerine studies have tested the prediction that islands have lower parasite pressure that in turn lowers immune investment (Lindström et al. 2004), although comparative and case studies have found weak or opposite patterns (Matson 2006; Matson et al. 2013). As urbanization can reduce connectivity (Munshi-South and Kharchenko 2010), urban-Author Manuscript This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved rural sampling gradients could provide additional assessments. On ecological timescales, isolated populations may lose herd immunity and be more vulnerable to pathogens, as suggested for Australian flying foxes (Pteropus spp.; Plowright et al. 2011). Bats in particular pose several 514 challenges for spatial studies of immunity when compared to passerines and rodents (e.g., lack of reagents, large home ranges). However, the potential insights about parasite spillover to humans 516 and domestic animals may be especially important from an applied standpoint, when considering 517 that bats host many zoonoses and are increasingly affected by urbanization (Kessler et al. 2018). 518 519 Methodological recommendations 520 To facilitate testing such questions and improve inference in macroimmunology, we highlight several methodological recommendations for large-scale field studies. These build upon the 522 various benefits gained from exploratory geostatistical tools and spatial statistical methods. 523 Although we recommend using geostatistical tools such as correlograms to identify the 524 range of spatial dependence and guide sampling decisions (e.g., aid in decisions for the distance between field sites), sufficient data may not exist for a given host system or for closely related species. Researchers could instead use semi-random site distributions (Abolins et al. 2018) or spatial gradients, such as sampling latitudinally (Adelman et al. 2010), at the core and limits of a geographic range (Ardia 2007a), or along range expansions of invasive species (Martin et al. 2017). As noted above, range expansions are particularly interesting for macroimmunology, as each is an explicit spatial and temporal process. Considering this joint variation, spatial patterns in immunity could be most evident in seasons when food is limited or when abiotic conditions are harsh (Nelson and Demas 1996). For example, work on red deer immunity found that spatial patterns in antibody concentrations varied substantially across seasons (Albery et al. 2018). Although incorporating seasonality into macroimmunology may not always be feasible given tradeoffs between spatial and temporal sampling, we also implore researchers to consider time when standardizing efforts over space. Spatial patterns can be obscured, or artificially produced, if sites are sampled at different months or years or use different protocols (Plowright et al. 2019). For ecoimmunology, factors such as the time between capture and sampling and time between sample collection and assays can also introduce additional noise (Zylberberg 2015; Author Manuscript This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved Becker, Czirják, Rynda-Apple, et al. 2018). For macroimmunology, we thus encourage spatial sampling at a uniform timepoint or conducting spatiotemporally coordinated field studies. A broader concern in ecoimmunology is whether variation in immunity corresponds to a host's ability to clear infection or to past or current infection state (Bradley and Jackson 2008). Several studies highlighted in this review demonstrate that spatial studies can differentiate the effect of parasite pressure from those of abiotic or biotic conditions when data on both predictors exist (e.g., Couch et al. 2008; Cornet et al. 2009; Table 1). However, it is often unclear whether to target a priori parasites known to exert selective pressures, which can introduce bias if these parasites have locally gone extinct in a host population. Alternatively, metagenomic assays can quantify parasite diversity more broadly (Edwards and Rohwer 2005). Although the costs of metagenomics remain high when applied to individual hosts, macroimmunology studies could pool samples by site to generate a spatial metric of parasite pressure (Bergner et al. 2019). Such less-biased data on spatial parasite diversity could be included with other environmental covariates to assess their relative contribution to shaping spatial variation in immune defense. This approach would be especially informative for testing whether latitudinal gradients in immunity simply reflect latitudinal gradients in parasite pressure or other biogeographic factors. Similarly, ecoimmunology has moved from attempting to quantify "immunocompetence" to measuring multiple functional responses (Demas et al. 2011). The development of sequencing and transcriptomic technologies now allows profiling immune gene expression via single gene and genomic approaches (Fassbinder-Orth 2014). Such advances have been adopted by macroimmunology, as studies most often tested spatial variation in immune genes with qPCR, MHC diversity, and RNA-Seq. Systems approaches could also provide less reductionist measures of how the environment is associated with immunological traits (Martin et al. 2016). Traits such as resistance and competence are difficult to measure directly but provide the most effective insights about defense (Downs et al. 2014). Most immune measures included in our synthesis are likely to reflect resistance or competence; tolerance, the ability to minimize effects of parasites on fitness, has rarely been explored spatially. In one key example, house finches in areas with a longer history of M. gallisepticum presence showed greater tolerance than birds in areas with no exposure (Adelman et al. 2013). Such work, alongside theory on resource variation and tolerance (Budischak and Cressler 2018), highlights the need for future work in this</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>constitutive expression of a pro-inflammatory cytokine predicted shorter infectious periods (indicating stronger resistance), whereas greater expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine was associated with improved tolerance (Burgan, Gervasi, and Martin 2018). Validation of biomarkers for such traits would improve inference in macroimmunology. The experimental validation of biomarkers for resistance and tolerance also highlights just one of several complementary areas between large-scale studies and more focused, smallscale studies of immunity and environmental variation. We see macroimmunology as playing an important role in developing hypotheses for field experiments and captive studies that triangulate on causal inference (Plowright, Sokolow, et al. 2008). In particular, large-scale field studies could fit into prior research programs for developing model systems in ecoimmunology, where researchers first obtain extensive information about host-parasite interactions and immune phenotypes before identifying reliable biomarkers (Pedersen and Babayan 2011). Following such foundational work, a cross-sectional macroimmunology study could identify the scale of spatial dependence in immunity across a broad site gradient and identify environmental covariates with high importance. Subsequently, one could set up a focused field manipulation or longitudinal study within a smaller, more logistically feasible number of sites that span the identified range of environmental variation. For example, a macroimmunology study that identifies latitudinal range limits as a key predictor of immune phenotypes, rather than elevation or any geographic range edge (Ardia 2007b; Becker, Nachtmann, et al. 2019), could direct longitudinal work to capture seasonal variation across several sites at the core, northern, and southern parts of a distribution.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head>(</head><label></label><figDesc>Stephens et al. 2016; Martin et al. 2018). Machine learning algorithms hold particular promise, given their ability to accommodate heterogeneous datasets and high degrees of collinearity (Hochachka et al. 2007). Boosted regression trees could facilitate deriving the importance of environmental covariates collected across diverse spatial scales (e.g., Brock et al. 2019) to immunological data within and between studies and taxa. Further, cladistic methods such as phylogenetic factorization, which can identify taxonomic groups at various phylogenetic scales that most differ in species-level data, could identify which host clades show consistent relationships between spatial covariates and specific immune phenotypes (Washburne et al. 2019). Future applications could assess the degree to which spatial autocorrelation in immunity (e.g., range parameters from correlograms, global Moran's I) displays phylogenetic signal. Such cladistic patterns could be applied to guide taxa-dependent spatial sampling designs. Advances in meta-analysis relevant to ecology and evolution (Nakagawa and Santos 2012) could also help reveal general relationships between environmental conditions and immunity while controlling for phylogenetic relatedness between host species, methodological variation, and spatial proximity of studies. Our systematic review did not quantitatively synthesize effect sizes for the relationships between spatial covariates and immunity, given the current limitations in spatial replication and analysis. However, future application of metaanalytic methods could test general support for several of the questions posed as research priorities. For example, a recent meta-analysis of forest degradation had an overall moderate Author Manuscript This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved effect size with immune outcomes (Messina et al. 2018). Additional meta-analyses could further test how particular immune axes (e.g., innate or adaptive), measures of function (e.g., BKA), or whole-organism traits (e.g., tolerance) generally respond to latitude, whether these trends are driven by parasite richness, and how relationships may vary by taxa. With sufficient data across geographies and species, similar meta-analyses could assess general patterns in how range expansions affect investment in inflammation rather than humoral defense. Meta-analyses of urbanization could assess whether these habitats enhance innate defense or facilitate a general upregulation of immunity or how greater isolation of urban hosts (and lower genetic diversity within populations; Miles et al. 2019) affects immune response and diversity. Such analyses could provide novel and generalizable insights into the spatial drivers of defense. Conclusions Macroecology holds promise as an approach to identify the drivers of spatial variation in wildlife immune defense. Future work on the host taxa and priority questions emphasized here, alongside opportunities posed by coupling large-scale field studies with small-scale field experiments and longitudinal approaches as well as applying large-scale data synthesis, could facilitate scaling ecoimmunology from individual-to habitat-level perspectives. Such work could provide new insights into the environmental drivers of defense while also facilitating novel opportunities to predict infection risks in the context of climate change (e.g., through latitudinal gradients), range expansions and biological invasions, and land conversions (e.g., urbanization and habitat loss).</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>As seasonality could also shape immunity while having different effects across space, sampling at a small number of uniform timepoints across populations (e.g., winter, summer) may be particularly informative; only 13% of multi-site studies assessed seasonality (this did not vary with taxa; χ 2 =0.66, p=0.95), highlighting an important area for future work. Quantifying spatial dependence from pilot data or from similar systems could identify the spatial scales at which sampling should occur to obtain sufficient immunological variance. For example, strong autocorrelation at small scales suggests sites could be relatively close, whereas a large range estimate suggests sites could be further apart to be subjected to sufficient spatial variation. Knowing the scale of spatial dependence can also facilitate how to best spatially subdivide a given sampling grid for random stratified designs, which can limit spatial site clusters generated by purely random sampling (Smith et al. 2017).Our review also suggests macroimmunology studies should better control for spatialdependence. Ignoring spatial dependence in statistical analyses can inflate model coefficients, All rights reserved intra-and inter-population variation (Downs and Dochtermann 2014). Aggregating data further limits the ability to account for individual-level covariates, such as reproduction and age, that can moderate relationships between spatial predictors and immunity (Merrill et al. 2019). Common individual-level covariates in our multi-site studies included morphology (e.g., mass), sex, and age (Fig. S3). We strongly encourage greater use of GLMMs that include site as a random effect to allow the partitioning of immunological variance into repeatability within and between sites as well as quantifying the importance of both individual-and habitat-level factors. Furthermore, GLMMs can accommodate spatial correlation structures to account for the spatial distribution of sites (Zuur, Ieno, Walker, Saveliev, &amp; Smith, 2009), and autocorrelation measures can be derived to ensure no residual spatial dependence. Similarly, GAMs can account for nonlinearity in environmental predictors while including a smoothed interaction of longitude and latitude or a spatial correlation structure (Wood 2006). Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) is also becoming popular owing to its computational efficiency and flexible model construction (Blangiardo et al. 2013). INLA incorporates a two-dimensional spatial random effect that can be plotted to investigate hot-and cold spots of immunity. One INLA case study highlighted spatial agreement and discordance between several immune metrics and parasitism in red deer (Albery et al., 2018). Greater adoption of spatial statistics will strengthen our understanding of how the environment shapes immune defense while minimizing potential statistical artifacts.</figDesc><table /><note>Quantifying spatial dependence can also assist with sampling designs, which often involve tradeoffs between spatial and temporal replication (Plowright et al. 2019).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Cyanobacteria are a group of gram-negative photosynthetic, oxygen-evolving prokaryotes broadly distributed in the terrestrial and aquatic environments on Earth and are considered to be important contributors to the photosynthetic biomass production. They are present even in extreme habitats, such as high or low temperatures, highly basic or acidic pH, desiccation, and high salt concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Because of their unique survival strategies acquired during evolution, the cyanobacteria thrive under harsh environmental conditions. For instance, compatible solutes, such as sucrose, trehalose, glucosylglycerol, and glycine betaine, are accumulated in cyanobacterial cells during the acclimation of cyanobacteria to salt stress conditions, particularly salt and drought stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Besides, the cyanobacteria are simultaneously exposed to visible radiation and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in their habitats during absorption of solar energy for photosynthesis. In particular, high-altitude environment is thought to be one of the extreme habitats subjected to strong UVR. In the Alps, it was reported that the UVB radiation increases by $19% per 1000m altitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. To date, several studies have revealed the existence of diverse cyanobacterial species in high-altitude lakes located at altitudes of 2400-6400 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. The highly energetic UVR causes cell damage triggered by both direct effects on DNA and proteins and indirect effects via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. To avoid the toxic effects of UVR, it is known that the cyanobacteria are able to synthesize compounds, which confer protection against the UVR. Among these compounds, we place special emphasis on mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) as a natural cyanobacterial UV sunscreen in this review chapter.</p><p>MAAs offer a great potential for the development of novel UV sunscreens because of their direct and indirect protective properties. Previous studies provided the evidence that MAAs are capable of protecting cyanobacteria by absorbing harmful UV range wavelengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Moreover, in addition to UV-absorbing properties, evidence is accumulating that MAAs possess other physiological functions, such as antioxidative, scavengers of toxic oxygen radicals (ROS), and as an osmoprotectant <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. These characteristics indicate MAAs to be a promising candidate for natural sunscreen(s) and with pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. In this chapter, we describe several important aspects of cyanobacterial MAAs, from essential features to potential applications. Furthermore, recent patents related to MAAs are also reviewed. Since the research publications by global research groups have increased tremendously in last 2 decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the interest in MAAs is thought to be growing markedly. In particular, according to the number of published articles in PubMed, cyanobacteria are the most investigated MAAs producing organisms including eukaryotic algae, invertebrates, vertebrates, dinoflagellates, bacteria, and yeast, during 2001-16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In addition, because of their photoautotrophic and transformable properties and availability of genome sequences, cyanobacteria have gained much attention as attractive biofactories for the production of beneficial natural products. This chapter will impart knowledge to the readers on cyanobacterial MAAs starting from detailed basic observations to very recent developments in various commercial fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BASIC DESCRIPTION OF MAAs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discovery of MAAs</head><p>Mycosporine is a group of nitrogenous water-soluble metabolites, which were reported as compounds associated with light-stimulated sporulation in terrestrial fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In 1965, Leach found the presence of UV-absorbing (l max ¼ 310 nm) compound named P-310 in fungi when sporulation was induced by near-UV irradiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Later, Favre-Bonvin et al. chemically identified the first substance of P-310 as 2-methoxy-3-bis(hydroxymethyl)methylamino-5-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-2-cyclohexene-1-one (mycosporine-serinol) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In the molecular structure of mycosporine-serinol, the structural analogue to amino acid serine, serinol, is conjugated to a cyclohexenone ring ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5.1</ref>). "Mycosporine" is a common name of the fungal metabolites, which have UV absorption and substituted with amino acid residues <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In 1969, Shibata found UV-absorbing compounds in aqueous extracts of six zooxanthellate scleractinian corals (five Acropora and one Pocillopora species) and a cyanobacterium in the Great Barrier Reef <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This material, named S-320, showed a broad UV absorption maximum at approximately 320 nm. Subsequently S-320 was identified as a family of mycosporine derivatives. These compounds have been grouped as MAAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. A more detailed historical context for discovery of MAAs has been well presented in previous review papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. MAAs are characterized by a cyclohexenone or cyclohexenimine ring as the core chromophore structure that has a methoxy moiety in C2 position. C3 position on the ring structure of MAAs is commonly substituted with an amino compound, while C1 position is substituted with either an oxo or an imino moiety. For example, in the structure of shinorine, which is one of the major MAAs in cyanobacteria, glycine, and serine bind to C3 and C1 positions of core chromophore ring structure, respectively. The details of their chemical structure and biosynthesis are mentioned later in this chapter. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.1, examples of the molecular structure of mycosporine and MAAs are shown. To date, more than 20 different MAAs have been identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic Characteristics of MAAs</head><p>MAAs are low molecular weight secondary metabolites, which are known as a UV-screening molecule <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. MAAs are considered to be the strongest UVAabsorbing compounds in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. These compounds are characterized by absorption maxima from 310 to 362 nm with large molar extinction coefficients (e ¼ 28,100-50,000mol À1 cm À1 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For instance, molar extinction coefficients of porphyra-334 and shinorine at 334 nm are 42,300 and 44,700 mol À1 cm À1 , respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. MAAs can dissipate excess energy in the heat form without generating ROS after absorbing the highly energetic UVR <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. MAAs are synthesized in various organisms, such as micro-and macroalgae, eukaryotic phytoplankton, fungi, and cyanobacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. MAAs accumulating in these organisms are thought to contribute toward reducing the damaging effect of UVR. Besides their UV sunscreen roles, MAAs are thought to be multifunctional, and as also will be demonstrated later.</p><p>MAAs are highly water-soluble compounds compared to other UVabsorbing compounds, such as the scytonemin and carotenoids in cyanobacteria. This feature arises from their zwitterionic characteristics derived from the amino acid substitution. Therefore, MAAs are accumulated as solutes in the cytosolic space. But in the cosmopolitan terrestrial cyanobacterium Nostoc commune, it has been reported that mycosporine derivatives which are linked to amino acids and oligosaccharides are secreted by the cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. These compounds form extremely large complexes that are noncovalently attached to the extracellular glycan sheath. Recently, it has been reported that shinorine was located in the extracellular matrix of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa strain PCC 7806 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distribution of MAAs</head><p>MAAs are distributed widely in nature. Since mycosporines were first found in fungi, reports on MAAs from various micro-and macroorganisms, such as red alga, sea stars, corals, dinoflagellates, and cyanobacteria, have emerged <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, the finding of MAAs in bacteria except for cyanobacteria and archaea has not been reported so far. Although MAAs can be detected in animals, it is believed that they do not produce these compounds directly. Accumulating evidence reveals that animals take up MAAs through the food chain or from symbiotic microorganisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, Shinzato et al. reported the presence of gene cluster homologs to cyanobacterial MAA synthetic genes in coral and sea anemones, therefore de novo synthesis of MAAs in these animals might be possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In addition, Osborn et al. demonstrated that vertebrates could synthesize the MAAs related compound, gadusol <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>In cyanobacteria, shinorine is known as the most dominant MAA. Various MAAs, such as porphyra-334, mycosporine-glycine have also been reported so far. Shinorine has been detected in various cyanobacterial species, such as Chlorogloeopsis PCC 6912 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Scytonema sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, Nodularia (Nodularia baltica, Nodularia harveyana, and Nodularia spumigena) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, Anabaena doliolum <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, N. commune <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and M. aeruginosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Among these cyanobacteria, Scytonema sp. and A. variabilis accumulated shinorine as a sole MAA, while it has been reported that the remaining strains accumulated other MAAs in addition to shinorine. Chlorogloeopsis accumulated mycosporine-glycine together with shinorine after UVB exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In three Nodularia strains, porphyra-334 was the more dominant MAA than shinorine before and after UVB irradiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In A. doliolum, shinorine and porphyra-334 were detected only under UV irradiation condition, while mycosporine-glycine was produced constitutively <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In N. commune, Sinha et al. detected only shinorine <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Later, Sakamoto's group characterized glycosylated MAAs from this desiccant cyanobacterium. These are 1050-Da MAA with two distinct chromophores of 3-aminocyclohexen-1-one and 1,3-diaminocyclohexen <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, hexose-bound palythine-threonine derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, 7-O-(b-arabinopyranosyl)-porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, pentose-bound shinorine <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and hexose-bound porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, together with porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Genetic differences of N. commune used in these studies caused different accumulation pattern of MAAs. Glycosylated MAAs in N. commune are supposed to be localized in the extracellular matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. M. aeruginosa accumulated shinorine for &gt;95% of total MAAs compared to only a small amount of porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. It should be noted that a recent study using M. aeruginosa strain PCC 7806 detected shinorine but not porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In addition to these MAAs, asterina-330, palythene, and palythinol were also reported as the usual cyanobacterial MAAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. On the other hand, halophilic cyanobacterium Euhalothece sp., which exists in the upper layer of gypsum crust of a hypersaline pond, was reported to produce mycosporine-2-glycine together with euhalothece-362 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. It is also known that a halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica can synthesize mycosporine-2-glycine as the sole MAA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Moreover, three MAAs, mycosporine-taurine, dehydroxylusujirene, and M-343, have been characterized in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In this cyanobacterium, mycosporine-tau synthesis was induced by both UVA and UVB exposure, while synthesis of dehydroxylusujirene and M-343 was induced only under UVA exposure. However, according to the experiments conducted by Singh et al., the identity of these unusual MAAs in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is questionable <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. In addition to the compounds mentioned earlier, various other cyanobacterial MAAs, including those not yet characterized, have been reported so far <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF MAAs</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Structure of MAAs</head><p>MAAs generally consist of a cyclohexenone or cyclohexenimine ring. Among the MAAs illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.1, mycosporine-glycine, having absorption maxima at 310 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, possesses a cyclohexenone ring in which C3 position is linked with an amino acid, glycine. Monosubstituted MAAs like mycosporine-glycine are called as oxocarbonyl-MAAs, and found in many organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In cyanobacteria, for example, mycosporine-taurine and mycosporine-g-aminobutyric acid (mycosporine-GABA) were recently reported as oxocarbonyl-MAAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. Mycosporine-glycine is a common intermediate for the bioproduction of disubstituted MAAs such as shinorine, porphyra-334, and mycosporine-2-glycine <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In the synthesis of disubstituted MAAs, usually a second amino acid, amino alcohol, or enaminone system is conjugated to the C1 position of mycosporine-glycine, with few exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The absorption maxima of disubstituted MAAs vary from 320 to 362 nm, depending on the nitrogen substituents. Further modifications of the amino acid group of some MAAs by condensation, dehydration, decarboxylation, oxidation, reduction, sulfonation, and glycosylation are also known <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In cyanobacteria, as aforementioned, several glycosylated MAAs have been identified in N. commune by a Japanese research group <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Most recently, this group revealed that the edible cyanobacterium Nostoc sphaericum contained glycosylated MAAs, 13-O-b-galactosyl-porphyra-334 (b-Gal-P334), and hexosyl-shinorine, together with porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. They demonstrated that b-Gal-P334 might play an important role in stress tolerant mechanism in N. sphaericum and has a potential for use as an ingredient in cosmetics and toiletries. Furthermore, another group discovered hexose-bound derivatives of shinorine and palythine-serine as glycosylated MAAs in two strains of the cyanobacterium Scytonema cf. crispum <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resonance Delocalization in the Molecular Structure of MAAs</head><p>Among MAAs characterized so far, only the molecular structure of palythine <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and palythene <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> was confirmed by X-ray crystal analysis over 35 years ago. In the crystal, palythine existed as a zwitterion, which was stabilized by resonance between two canonical structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The palythine and water molecules are associated by hydrogen bonding, forming a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Palythene was also clarified as a zwitterion in which the positive and negative charges were favorable to exist in the near position to each other. Two canonical structures are thought to contribute to a resonance hybrid structure of palythene <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The canonical structures and resonant hybrid structure of palythine and palythene are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>.2. Following that the entire stereostructure of porphyra-334 was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. NMR chemical shift which was assignable to imine carbon of porphyra-334 was consistent with the result of DFT calculations using the imino nitrogen-protonated form of porphyra-334. A very high proton affinity (265.7 kcal/mol) of lone pairs on imine nitrogen suggested that porphyra-334 could be a proton sponge <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Thus, the nitrogen atom at the imine group of MAAs appears to be protonated to form zwitterion, and resulting conjugation causes delocalization of the positive charge on a nitrogen atom over the chromophore. The extensive conjugation of MAAs facilitates absorption of UV. The degree of resonance delocalization in MAA molecules influences the position of their absorption maximum and extinction coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The higher extinction coefficient of MAAs is caused by the more efficient p-electron delocalization in a molecule <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effects of Environmental Factors on the Molecular Structure of MAAs</head><p>It has been reported that pH affects the absorption spectra of MAAs. Zhang et al. showed that the absorption maximum of porphyra-334 changed in high acidic solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The absorption maximum of porphyra-334 shifted from 334 to 330 nm and 332 nm in the solution at pH 1-2 and 3, respectively. Under these highly acidic conditions, the absolute absorbance also decreased. The authors discussed that the protonation of the unbounded lone pair electrons of nitrogen atoms in porphyra-334 molecule might prevent the resonance delocalization under acidic conditions with a pH below 3.0. In contrast, the absorption maximum and extinction coefficient did not change in alkaline solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, a similar pH dependency of mycosporine-glycine and shinorine was also reported by Matsuyama et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. The authors demonstrated that the zwitterionic characteristics of the amino acid residue stimulated the protonation to the chromophoric aminocyclohexenone and aminocyclohexenimine moieties of mycosporine-glycine and shinorine, respectively. They confirmed that protonation to a carboxylate anion in the amino acid residue resulted in the shift of absorption maximum of these compounds at pH 1-2. It has also been known that the property of the solvent also affects the UV-vis spectral characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. In addition, Zhang et al. reported that temperature had a remarkable effect on the stability of porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. They found that the absorbance of porphyra-334 decreased rapidly with an increase in temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of the Molecular Structure of MAAs</head><p>To determine the molecular structure of MAAs, appropriate extraction procedures for isolation of MAAs are critical. A variety of extraction methods have been reported for a broad range of microorganisms including cyanobacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Methanol and ethanol have been generally used in various concentrations to extract MAAs. In particular, Volkmann and Gorbushina presented a universal method allowing simultaneous extraction of MAAs by testing 31 cyanobacterial, 11 actinomycete, and 45 fungal strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Extracted MAAs were usually separated and isolated by suitable liquid chromatographic techniques as described later.</p><p>Although the absorption maxima of MAAs vary depending on their structure including nitrogen substituents and attached side groups, the differences might be very small, or the absorption maxima of many MAAs are identical. Further, as mentioned earlier, the value of absorption maximum of MAAs might be affected by some environmental factors, such as the pH. Taking into account these facts, it is difficult to identify MAAs by only analyzing their absorption spectra. Therefore, comparing the retention time of the target compounds with authentic standards by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, with either reversed-phase octadecylsilica (C18) or octylsilica (C8) columns has been often used so far. The classical HPLC method was based on C18 column and isocratic elution mode with mobile phase containing 0.02% acetic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Seven of the nine MAAs known at the time could be separated by this method. To date, many HPLC methods for separation of MAAs have been reported, and there are several papers summarizing some of them <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. In addition to the retention time in HPLC analysis, information on the molecular weight of target compounds by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis including liquid chromatography (LC)-MS has been used for the identification of MAAs. Resolving the composition of MAAs by analyzing hydrolyzed amino acids also has contributed toward identifying their structure. For example, a MAA compound synthesized in the halotolerant cyanobacterium A. halophytica was characterized as mycosporine-2-glycine by the combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and amino acid analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. On the other hand, characterization of novel and atypical MAAs is not easy and requires several ordered analytical experiments. For example, the 478-Da MAA in N. commune with an absorption maximum at 335 nm was identified by using multiple analytical methods. At first, the molecular mass was determined by MALDI-TOF MS analysis, and second, the data from infrared (IR) spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF MS/MS, and NMR analyses suggested that the 478-Da MAA was a porphyra-334 derivative bound to pentose <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Third, the released pentose from hydrolyzed 478-Da MAA was determined to be an arabinose by gas chromatography (GC)-MS analysis, and this MAA was finally characterized as 7-O-(b-arabinopyranosyl)-porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Thus, using the appropriate and reliable analytical instruments in combination has been effective for the characterization of MAAs. In addition, further technological innovation, such as improvement of sensitivity of analytical equipments, will also help promote the discovery of new MAAs which exist in very small amounts in the organism. These analytical equipments include next-generation MS. For example, electrospray ionization, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), and surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI). Combining different instrumentations as hyphenated devices, such as CE-MS (capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry), HPLC-MS (high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry), or HPLC-NMR (high-performance liquid chromatography-nuclear magnetic resonance), is one of the most promising ways in the discovery of novel MAAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY OF MAAs Biosynthetic Pathway of 4-Deoxygadusol, the Common Precursor Compound of MAAs</head><p>The common precursor compound for the synthesis of mycosporines and MAAs is 4-deoxygadusol (4-DG). Shikimate pathway is believed to be the major 4-DG synthesis pathway due to the following observations. First, an incorporation experiment using radiolabelled compounds revealed that 3-dehydroquinate (DHQ), a shikimate pathway intermediate, was the precursor of cyclohexenone ring of mycosporines in the anamorphic fungus Trichothecium roseum <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Second, Portwich and Garcia-Pichel demonstrated the incorporation of radiolabelled pyruvate, which can be converted to one of the precursors of the shikimate pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), resulted in labeling of the cyclohexenone ring of MAAs in cyanobacterium Chlorogloeopsis sp. strain PCC 6912 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Third, these authors reported that the synthesis of MAAs was inhibited by addition of tyrosine, which acts as a feedback inhibitor of the shikimate pathway, in Chlorogloeopsis sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Fourth, synthesis of MAAs in the coral Stylophora pistillata was inhibited by glyphosate, a shikimate pathway-specific inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. In 2010, based on genome mining, two genes in cyanobacterium A. variabilis ATCC29413, Ava_3858 (predicted DHQ synthase-DHQS) and Ava_3857 (O-methyltransferase-O-MT), were proposed as factors which might be responsible for production of 4-DG via 3-DHQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The combination of genes corresponding to Ava_3858 and Ava_3857 was not found in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. MAAs could not be detected in these three cyanobacterial strains in that study <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>; and therefore, these two genes were thought to be specific to MAA synthesis. On the other hand, almost simultaneously, a different 4-DG synthesis pathway was reported by Balskus and Walsh <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. They conducted in vitro experiments using the translated products of the genes in cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC29133, NpR5600 and NpR5599, which are homologous to Ava_3858 and Ava_3857, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Their experiments revealed that NpR5600 and NpR5599 proteins did not produce 4-DG from 3-DHQ, in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), nicotineamideadenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), and Co 2+ . On the contrary, these proteins could produce 4-DG from sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (SHP), the intermediate of pentose phosphate pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. This result demonstrated that cyanobacterial MAAs could be synthesized from SHP. In fact, the NpR5600 protein resembles DHQS homolog 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (EVS), which is an enzyme that converts SHP to 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone, rather than a canonical DHQS <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, although DHQS and EVS belong to the same superfamily of enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Thus, two possible biosynthetic pathways of 4-DG by DHQS/EVS and O-MT have been proposed so far ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5.3</ref>). In addition, and interestingly, it has been reported that knockout of the Ava_3858 gene did not result in a loss of ability to synthesize shinorine in A. variabilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, indicating redundancy of DHQS/EVS in this cyanobacterium. Specific inhibition of the shikimate pathway by glyphosate or L-phenylalanine in Ava_3858 knockout mutant revealed that both the pentose phosphate pathway and the shikimate pathway are associated in MAA production in A. variabilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. On the other hand, the knockout mutant of Ava_3857 gene did not show any marked induction of shinorine by UVA exposure in A. variabilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. This result suggests that O-MT in the MAA synthetic gene cluster is indispensable for MAA production in cyanobacteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene Clusters for Biosynthesis of MAAs</head><p>The gene responsible for the condensation of amino acid moieties to 4-DG was first identified in shinorine-producing cyanobacterium A. variabilis. The gene Ava_3856, which is located next to Ava_3857, encodes a protein homologous to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-grasp enzyme superfamily <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. The protein product of Ava_3856 was confirmed to convert 4-DG to mycosporine-glycine. In this reaction, 4-DG is phosphorylated depending on ATP, and then ligated with glycine <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. The last gene for shinorine production, Ava_3855, encodes a nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS)-like protein.</p><p>NRPSs are known to form peptide bonds outside the ribosomal machinery. The Ava_3855 protein produced shinorine from mycosporineglycine by attachment of the serine moiety in vitro and in Escherichia coli cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. During this conversion reaction, Ava_3855 is supposed to activate serine carboxylate to form imine <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. The four genes, Ava_3858, Ava_3857, Ava_3856, and Ava_3855, are recognized as the gene cluster responsible for shinorine synthesis in A. variabilis ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5.4)</ref>. Besides, the clusters, four genes in cyanobacteria N. punctiforme (NpR5600, NpR5599, NpR5598, and NpR5597) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>, A. halophytica (Ap3858, Ap3857, Ap3856, and Ap3855) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 (mysA, mysB, mysC, and mysD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> have also been characterized to produce MAAs so far ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5.4</ref>). In A. halophytica, a gene Ap3858, homologous to Ava_3858, was not found in the upper region of Ap3857, but found at the distant end. The Ap3858 protein also contained an additional functionally unknown N-terminal domain. Heterologous expression of A. halophytica gene cluster in E. coli cells resulted in the production of mycosporine-2-glycine, not shinorine <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Therefore, the last step of MAA biosynthesis by the fourth protein might cause different attachment of amino acid residues. Furthermore, in contrast to A. variabilis, the fourth gene of these cyanobacteria (NpR5597/Ap3855/mysD) encodes for D-Ala-D-Ala ligase, and especially in N. punctiforme, the direction of NpR5597 transcription is opposite that of NpR5600, NpR5599, and NpR5598 <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>. In cyanobacteria, the fourth gene homologous to D-Ala-D-Ala ligase is more common than that homologous to NPRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Biochemical characterization of the function of NRPSs and D-Ala-D-Ala ligases would be interesting to clarify. In addition, redundant genes that might be responsible for the conjugation of nitrogen substituents were found in some cyanobacterial species <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. In Cylindrospermum stagnale PCC 7417, the gene cluster for MAA synthesis consists of five unusual genes, mylA, mylB, mylC, mylD, and mylE <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. These genes encode for putative proteins responsible for EVS (mylA), O-MT (mylB), D-Ala-D-Ala ligase (mylC), and ATP-grasp (mylD and mylE) ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5.4</ref>). Heterologous expression of these five genes in E. coli resulted in the bioproduction of rare MAAs, mycosporine-ornithine, and mycosporine-lysine. Future studies of the unusual MAA synthetic genes like mylA-mylE in C. stagnale PCC 7417 will give additional new insights into the cyanobacterial MAA synthetic pathway. Genes homologous to cyanobacterial MAA synthetic genes have also been found in fungi, actinobacteria, dinoflagellates, sea anemones, and corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. In fungi, the fourth gene encoding NRPS/D-Ala-D-Ala ligase was not found in their genomic DNA sequence, consistent with their property for production of monosubstituted mycosporines. On the other hand, in two actinobacteria, Actinosynnema mirum DSM 43827 and Pseudonocardia sp. strain P1, a complete set of gene cluster homologous to cyanobacteria was discovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. The ability of these gene clusters for MAA production was confirmed by heterologous expression in Streptomyces avermitilis SUKA22.  thought to be horizontally transferred from cyanobacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Detailed molecular analyses of genes or proteins associated with MAA production have only been conducted in cyanobacteria so far. Molecular investigation of MAAs synthetic pathway using with other organisms will be an interesting subject for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REGULATIONS</head><p>It has been reported that the intracellular MAA level is affected by various environmental factors in MAA-accumulating organisms, including cyanobacteria. In this section, the effects of UVR and other abiotic stress factors on MAA production in cyanobacteria are summarized. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of cyanobacterial MAA biosynthetic pathway still remain elusive and need to be further investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of UVR</head><p>Biosynthesis of MAAs is typically enhanced by UV exposure. In cyanobacteria, MAA production was significantly increased by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), UVA (315-400 nm) radiation, and UVB (280-315 nm) radiation. The most effective induction by UVB radiation was shown in A. variabilis, A. doliolum, Anabaena sp., N. commune, Scytonema sp., Nodularia, and Arthrospira sp. In A. variabilis PCC 7937, the induction of shinorine was remarkably higher in cells exposed to PAR + UVA + UVB radiation than in cells exposed to only PAR or PAR + UVA radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Similar results were observed in A. doliolum, in which mycosporine-glycine, porphyra-334, and shinorine were induced by UVB radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Sinha et al. also demonstrated that UVB could enhance shinorine synthesis while PAR and UVA did not induce it significantly in Anabaena sp., N. commune, and Scytonema sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In three strains of Nodularia, it has been reported that UVB radiation plays an important role in the induction process of shinorine and porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Biosynthesis of mycosporine-glycine in Arthrospira sp. CU2556 was specifically enhanced by UVB radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Besides cyanobacteria, the upregulation of MAAs by UVR was also observed in other organisms, such as yeast, macroalgae, and marine microalgae such as prymnesiophyte, diatoms, and dinoflagellate <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Evidence for the presence and characteristics of a UVB-specific photoreceptor was presented in the cyanobacterium Chlorogleopsis PCC 6912 <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. In that report, a pterin was proposed as a candidate for the photoreceptor because the addition of an inhibitor for pterin synthesis, N-acetylserotonin (NAS) specifically diminished the MAA content in UV stressed cells. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction or linkages to gene expression related to MAA biosynthesis remains unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. On the other hand, the possibility of MAA induction via ROS without specific photoreceptors in colonies of S. pistillata has also been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. In addition, it was demonstrated that UVR caused synthesis and secretion of a water stress protein, WspA, in N. commune <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. WspA was proposed as an important factor in the global stress response of this cyanobacterium via modulation of the three-dimensional extracellular matrix, especially the transport, distribution, and/or macromolecular architecture of UV-absorbing pigment complexes including MAA and scytonemin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Salt and Thermal Stresses</head><p>In addition to irradiation, other abiotic stresses have been known to affect biosynthesis of MAAs. Induction of MAA accumulation by salt stress was reported in some cyanobacterial species. In Chlorogloeopsis, NaCl could induce synthesis of mycosporine-glycine and shinorine with or without UVB exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. The contents of these MAAs reached their maximum at 513 mM NaCl. Moreover, other salts, Na SO 4 , KCl, and MgCl also induced MAAs and had a similar effect as NaCl <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. In A. variabilis PCC 7937, Singh et al. demonstrated that NaCl stress treatment had synergistic effects on induction of shinorine with UV exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. These authors further found that NH 4 Cl also had a significant effect on the induction of shinorine <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In a halotolerant cyanobacterium A. halophytica, production of mycosporine-2-glycine was significantly upregulated by exposure to 2.0 M NaCl stress condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Moreover, the expression level of all four MAA synthetic genes (Ap3858-Ap3855) was enhanced remarkably by salt stress treatment in A. halophytica cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In addition to cyanobacteria, it was recently reported that the total concentration of MAAs was increased by salt stress in the marine dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. In corals Lobophytum compactum and Sinularia flexibilis, thermal stress also enhanced the accumulation level of MAAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In contrast, high temperature did not cause an increase in the MAA accumulation in cyanobacteria Chlorogloeopsis PCC 6912 and A. variabilis PCC 7973 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Nutrient Availability</head><p>Nutrient concentration also affects the MAA synthesis in cyanobacteria. Sulfur deficiency altered the composition of MAAs in A. variabilis PCC 7973 <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Although shinorine was the sole MAA in this cyanobaterium under normal growth conditions, sulfur deficiency triggered the synthesis of palythineserine as a secondary MAA. Palythine-serine accumulation was diminished by the addition of methionine to sulfur-deficient cultures. Methionine supply also affected the conversion of mycosporine-glycine into shinorine. In addition to sulfur, nitrogen supply also affects MAAs biosynthesis. Because MAAs are nitrogenous compounds, it has been proposed that they might act as an intracellular nitrogen storage molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In fact, in the cyanobacterium A. variabilis PCC 7973, an increase of shinorine was observed following the addition of ammonium salt <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. It has also been reported that ammonium in combination with UVR enhanced the production of porphyra-334 and shinorine in the marine red macroalga Porphyra columbina <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Moreover, in a halotolerant cyanobacterium A. halophytica, nitrate availability affected MAA production in response to change of salinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Intracellular level of mycosporine-2-glycine was increased with elevated nitrate concentration at high salinity in this cyanobacterium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONS</head><p>MAAs have a unique and strong UV absorption in the 310-362 nm (l max ) range with large molar extinction coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. These remarkable characteristics render MAAs as one of the strongest UVA-absorbing compounds in nature. Additionally, MAAs are also effective against shortwave UVB radiation. Thus, MAAs function primarily for photoprotection and as a sunscreen. Besides the photoprotective role, MAAs have antioxidant <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref> and antiinflammatory activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>, and occasionally participate in the osmotic equilibriums of diverse marine organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Most recently, MAA was shown to be involved in the cell-cell interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. All this evidence suggests that the MAAs have secondary functions and are thus multifunctional molecules. In this section, their primary and secondary activities and functions are described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photoprotectant and Sunscreen Functions</head><p>Photoprotectants are mainly UV absorbers. It is well known that only UVB (280-315 nm) and UVA (315-400 nm) radiation in the UV spectrum can pass through the atmosphere and reach ground level. MAAs can absorb lethal doses of these highly energetic UVRs. Early evidence revealed that MAA prevents 3 out of 10 photons from hitting cytoplasmic targets in cyanobacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Upon the deleterious effects of UVR, MAAs not only efficiently absorb UVR but also they dissipate excessive energy in form of harmless heat radiation without ROS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Correlation of MAAs and dose of UVR are evident from several reports. In cyanobacteria, the level of MAAs increased when exposed to PAR, UVA, and UVB irradiations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Among these wavelengths, UVB was found to be the most effective inducer of MAA accumulation, either in cyanobacteria and other known MAA producers, such as dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. A correlation between MAAs content and irradiance level supports the role of MAAs in photoprotection and as a sunscreen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antioxidant and Antiinflammation</head><p>Oxidative stress is a situation where ROS are generated and initiate a chain reaction. ROS are commonly produced when photosystems absorb more energy than can either be transferred by the electron transport chain to an electron acceptor or dissipated as heat. Various MAAs scavenge ROS such as hydroxyl radicals, hydroperoxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, and superoxide anions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Thus, MAAs can act as an antioxidant under the photooxidative stress condition triggered by ROS. The antioxidant role of MAAs might be of special significance. This property is advantageous in order to scavenge the free radicals generated through oxidative stress either due to UVR or other environmental stresses. Antioxidant activity of various MAAs was examined in vivo and in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>. In vitro analysis by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay revealed that mycosporine-2-glycine and mycosporine-glycine exhibited strong antioxidant properties compared to a lesser extent with shinorine and porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. The glycosylated-MAA derivatives found in the desiccant cyanobacterium N. commune also exhibited scavenging activity in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. In vivo analysis using the human melanoma cell lines A375 and normal human skin fibroblast (NHSF) revealed that mycosporine-2-glycine protected human cells against oxidative stress-mediated cell death. The presence of mycosporine-2-glycine protected the cells against oxidative stress caused by H 2 O 2 , suggesting that the antioxidant effect of mycosporine-2-glycine could be mediated through cellular mechanisms. Protective mechanism of mycosporine-2-glycine is possibly exerted via NF-kB blocking since mycosporine-2-glycine showed the inhibitory effect on NF-kB signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. In vitro/in vivo analyses point toward the role of MAAs in the antioxidant system/processes.</p><p>Antiinflammation activity of MAAs was demonstrated in HaCaT cells, immortalized human keratinocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. The MAAs shinorine, porphyra-334, and mycosporine-glycine modulated the expression of genes associated with inflammation caused by UVR. Among these MAAs, mycosporine-glycine strongly suppressed the expression of the COX-2 gene, a biomarker gene induced in response to inflammation in the skin. In a study by Suh's group, shinorine, porphyra-334, and mycosporine-glycine showed antiinflammatory activities in HaCaT cells against UVR <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. Furthermore, the expression of genes associated with aging in the skin, such as PCOLCE, elastin, and involucrin genes were found to be downregulated. By using the human skin fibroblasts (CCD-986sk), porphyra-334 exhibited protective effect on these fibroblasts from UV-induced cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Oyamada et al. reported the protective effects of shinorine, porphyra-334, and mycosporine-glycine on the human lung fibroblast cell line WI-38 from UVR. Among these MAAs, mycosporine-glycine presented the strongest activity to protect cells from UVR <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. Taken together, these results support the protective effects of MAAs as being antiinflammatory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other Functions</head><p>Some MAAs are known to participate in the osmotic equilibriums of diverse marine organisms. This physiological function serves the cells to keep a balance between intracellular osmotic pressure and outer environment. A very high concentration of MAAs was found in the community of cyanobacteria inhabiting a gypsum crust developing on the bottom of a hypersaline saltern pond in Eilat, Israel in which cyanobacterium A. halophytica was the majority species. The hypoosmotic shock of the medium by freshwater led to the excretion of MAAs out of the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. In addition, E. coli having A. halophytica MAA synthetic genes for mycosporine-2-glycine synthesis showed salt stress tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Based on these observations, MAA was proposed to serve as the additional osmotic solute in this cyanobacterium.</p><p>Recently, shinorine was found to accumulate in an extracellular matrix in bloom-forming cyanobacterium M. aeruginosa PCC 7806. In this cyanobacterium, shinorine level could not be correlated with the dose of UV. The authors proposed that it was synthesized for its role in extracellular matrix formation and cell-cell interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS</head><p>The natural compound MAAs have gained more interest not only as a sunscreen but also for several potential applications (such as in the bioindustry). These multifunctional biomolecules provide superior function to the sunscreen along with a secondary function through antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiaging properties. Furthermore, MAAs have strong photostability and an absence of cytotoxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. These outstanding characteristics endorse MAAs as promising candidates in the uses in cosmeceutical, pharmaceutical, biomedical, and biotechnological fields. In terms of the use as a sunscreen, MAAs are superior than the chemical or physical UV-protective compounds. The chemical UV-protective compounds merely provide a physical reflective barrier to the UV; and further, their exciting states generate ROS <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. On the contrary, MAAs strongly absorb UVR and dissipate excess energy in form of heat without generating ROS. Many chemical UV-protective compounds possess estrogen-like effect in vivo in the range of other known xenoestrogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. Moreover, UV sunscreens based on organic and/or inorganic compounds have shown adverse effects on the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. Thus, features of MAAs provide a new opportunity in the search for an alternative natural sunscreen compound source. Extreme stability at a wide pH range and temperatures also indicates the potential applications of MAAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Torres et al.</ref> reported that the crude methanolic extract of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos aquae, which contains porphyra-334, showed UVA protection ability comparable to a commercial sun care product of Boots (Boots Soltan Extra Moisturizing SunLotion, batch 1Z) <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. In fact, products called Helioguard ® 365 and Helionori ® that contains MAAs including porphyra-334 from the red alga Porphyra umbilicalis extract have been successfully commercialized as natural and safe UV-screening compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. MAAs are also beneficial for applications as skin care products since some MAAs have shown antioxidant and antiskin aging properties (see above). Antioxidant activities of MAAs might be able to contribute to the therapy of oxidation-associated diseases, like inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. Several studies have indicated the fact that MAAs possess antiinflammatory activities (see above). In addition, MAAs might serve as candidates for UV blockers for reducing the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) because it has been reported that certain algal-derived sun ray blockers reduced it <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Owing to the constantly increasing demand for cosmetics and natural medicines worldwide, MAAs are one of the highly promising and attractive natural products in the field of cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical bioactive compounds discovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RECENT PATENTS RELATED TO MAAs</head><p>MAAs have been exclusively reported in the marine photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, micro-, and macroalgae. With the availability of MAAs from microbial origins particularly the cyanobacteria, there is a feasibility to produce them at industrial scale by taking into account the simplicity of culture medium, high growth rate, and capacity for genetic manipulation. Hence, their production utilizing various biological approaches/technologies may hold a promising future. MAAs and their derivatives meet applications in skin care and cosmetics, biomedical including biotechnological applications. In the last section, we provide a general outline to search recent patents related to MAAs and their applications. By searching the freely accessible databases (such as WIPO, EPO, VSPTO, and Cambia), we retrieved 61 patents. We have tabulated all patents from these databases ( <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.1). These information sources present the state-of-the-art in patents and reflect future technological trends. Novel biotechnological processes for production, extraction, and formulation of MAAs were reported in many patents. MAAs were found to be commonly produced by marine organisms. A list in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.1 shows that most potential MAA producers were from the red algae, such as Polysiphonia lanosa, Gelidium sesquipedale, Porphyra leucostica, Bangia atropurpurea, and P. umbilicalis <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">142]</ref>. The second group was derived from the microalgae, such as Aphanizomenon and Chlorogloeopsis spp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">117]</ref>. The third group was cyanobacteria, Nostoc and Microcystis <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">129]</ref>. MAAs were also produced in the marine lichen Lichina pygmaea <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> and bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">122]</ref>. A rare case was seen in the starfish or sea anemone <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91]</ref>.</p><p>Beside the production from native organisms described earlier, heterologous expression also offers an alternative way for generating MAAs by various means. Engineering microbial factories offer good opportunities for the production of MAAs. A transformant Chlamydomonas hedleyi with Glut-1 gene was used in mass production of shinorine and porphyra-334 <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>. Nonpathogenic, gram-positive bacteria (e.g., in the genus Lactobacillus) were also considered, following genetic modification, for producing MAAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>. Noteworthy, the MAAs can be produced and excreted out of cells (extracellular product) <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>.</p><p>Purification of MAAs is another important step for additional applications. MAAs were generally extracted, separated, and purified by classical        A method for producing a MAA that includes a step in which microbes are cultivated that produce MAA on the outside of bacterial cells, a composition including the MAA produced using this method or the MAA indicated by formula (1), for preventing at least one symptom or disease selected from a group comprising acute skin reactions, aging of the skin, and skin cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref> WO2017013441 (2017)</p><p>Compositions and methods using palythine</p><p>World WIPO</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>King's College London</head><p>A composition comprising palythine, or salts thereof, in an amount of 0.3%-25% by weight, wherein palythine, or salts thereof, is the sole active ingredient. The invention also relates to a method of protecting a subject against skin damage, and/or against UVA damage, and/or against skin aging, and/or against UVB damage, and/or against reactive oxygen species generated by UVR chromatographic techniques. For instance, hydrophobic interaction and size exclusive columns <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>, cation and anion exchange chromatography <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>, and a solid-phase extraction column <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref> can be found in these patents. The emerging new technologies of a high-resolution separation technique and detection systems possessing very high sensitivity were not mentioned in any patent. Formulation of MAAs can be found either as a sole MAA or together with organic/inorganic sunscreening agents. It seems that formulation with organic or inorganic agents further enhance the protective effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. Formulations were commonly found as o/w emulsion, w/o emulsion with a high UV protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>. In some patents, additional natural medicine whitening ingredients <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>, sargassum polysaccharides <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>, and peptide derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref> were used for coformulation. Over the 20-year search window, it was revealed that most patents were discussed based on the utility of MAAs in sunscreen, skin care products, fibroblast growth accelerator, and promoter. The potential use of MAAs as an antioxidant substance was also retrieved. Methods for producing, extracting, formulating, and modifying of MAAs (such as glycosylation) seem to be the most popular in various countries. Additionally, nonmedical application of MAAs was found related to their use in the protection of paint films and plastics from solar degradation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUDING REMARKS</head><p>In this chapter, we have comprehensively reviewed important aspects of MAAs derived from cyanobacteria; covering their basic features, molecular structures, biosynthesis, regulations, biological activities, potential applications, and related patents. MAAs are known as essential biomolecules for living organisms that are directly exposed to sunlight. Besides being efficient natural sunscreens, some MAAs possess antioxidant functions, contribute to the osmotic balance, and are involved in cell-cell interaction. Thus, MAAs are actually multifunctional metabolites. Potential applications of MAAs have been demonstrated in numerous reports and patents with the superior function in sunscreen together with secondary function through antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiaging properties. With advances in omics and emerging new technologies, extensive research is and will be having a major role in the discovery of natural MAAs for their utilization in cosmeceutical, pharmaceutical, biomedical, and biotechnological fields.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 5 . 4</head><label>54</label><figDesc>Cyanobacterial MAA synthetic pathway.

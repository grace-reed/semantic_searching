			<abstract>
				<p>As a core component of the complement system, complement component 3 (C3) plays a central role in the opsonization of pathogens, immune defense and immune regulation in the mammalian for its activation is required to trigger classical as well as alternative complement pathways. However, the molecular mechanism underlying C3 activation in invertebrates remains unknown. Several C3 genes have been characterized in invertebrates but very few in crustacean. To understand the molecular characterization and immunological functions of shrimp C3, we characterized a novel complement C3 like gene (designated Lv-C3L) with full-length cDNA sequence identified from pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei in the present study. The full length cDNA of Lv-C3L sequence was 4769 bp (GenBank accession number: MH638255) containing a 4077 bp open reading frame (ORF), which encodes 1358 amino acids contained a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acids. Six model motifs of C3 were found in Lv-C3L including typical A2M domain, a highly conserved thioester region (GCGEQ) and proteolytic cleavage site of ANATO. In addition to typical conservative domains, Lv-C3L also contains a particular GLN-rich region which might be involved in the protein interaction and transcriptional activation. The transcripts of Lv-C3L were mainly detected in hemocytes and gill which might be involved in defense response. At 36 h post V.parahaemolyticus and B.thuringensis infection, the expression level of Lv-C3L gene in hemocytes were significantly upregulated. At 48 h and 72 h post WSSV infection, the expression level of Lv-C3L gene in hemocytes and gill were significantly upregulated. These results indicated that Lv-C3L gene play a pivotal role in innate immune responses to the WSSV and G + /G âˆ’ bacterial infection. The obvious immune function of Lv-C3L was described as an effective membrane rupture in bacteriolytic and hemolytic activities on V.parahaemolyticus, V.anguillarum and rabbit erythrocytes. Combining with WSSV copy number, WSSV-VP28 gene expression profile and shrimp cumulative mortality analysis, RNAi knockdown of Lv-C3L gene could obviously promote the in vivo propagation of WSSV in shrimp. This is the first report in crustaceans that Lv-C3L, as a key complement like components, is involved in shrimp antiviral immune response. It is speculated that complicated complement response cascade may exist in shrimp. These results collectively indicated that the complement pathway in shrimp might play an important protective role against pathogenic infection and activation of complement pathway including C3 could restrict the propagation of WSSV.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Immunity to infection is mediated by two general systems: acquired (or adaptive) and innate (or natural). The innate immune system is an evolutionarily ancient form, and it is crucial for the first line of defense before the acquired immune system comes into play <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Innate immunity has considerable specificity and is capable of discriminating between pathogens and self, thereby successfully defending invertebrates and vertebrates against infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Complement could be activated by pathogenic surfaces through an antibody-independent pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The complement system, which consists of three activation pathways including classic pathway, alternative pathway and the lectin pathway, is engaged in both acquired and innate immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> mediated immunity. The other two pathways (lectin and alternative) function in innate immune defense. The complement system is a cascade system composed of 40 factors in plasma or on cytoplasmic membrane that are regulated through the precise mechanism. These factors belongs to four types, including inherent components, regulatory molecules, complement receptors and activation of specific protein fragments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The complement system plays important immune surveillance role in humoral immunity, and provides a connection between innate immunity and adaptive immunity. As a member of many immune mechanisms, the complement system functions at the end of the immune process of the effective stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Complement component 3 (C3), was first identified in 1912 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Relative to other complement components, C3 is present in serum with the highest proportion. C3 is a Î²2 glycoprotein containing two peptide chains (Î± and Î²) and belongs to the thioester-containing protein (TEP) superfamily <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. C3 is continuously activated at a low rate in the fluid phase through either cleavage by serum proteases to C3a and C3b, reaction of the thioester with small nucleophiles or water, or non-specific perturbations leading to conformational changes and the exposure and hydrolysis of the thioester <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Activated C3 regulates the complement system, transferring the signal to C5 or the terminal pathway. The activated fragments of C3 (C3a and C3b) are involved as a factor that activates macrophages and mastocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. C3 is the core, the most abundant and complex factor in various components molecule of complement system as it is the intersection of several activation pathways, and depends on a positive feedback loop of C3b. The C3 gene is conserved and exists in vertebrates and many invertebrate species <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Complement C3 is activated via three convergent pathways (classical, alternative, and lectin). The activation of C3 can lead to a variety of host-defense systems, including the promotion of phagocytosis and the formation of a membrane-attack complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>To date, the C3 gene has been reported in many vertebrates and invertebrate species <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. In vertebrates, there have been much researches on C3 expounded the structure, biological activity and functional properties. C3 isoforms have been found in marine invertebrates, such as Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, Lottia gigantea <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, Crassostrea gigas <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> and Sinonovacula constricta <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Most of them focus on basic descriptions, expression patterns and characterizations from transcriptome and genome. However, few studies have characterized C3 and C3 activated fragments. Research on the function and activation pathway of C3 in invertebrates is still not clear. The culture production of Litopenaeus vannamei (L. vannamei) accounts for about 85% of the total shrimp production in mainland of China <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Both virus and bacteria can be dangerous pathogens for healthy development of shrimp in aquaculture. In the last decade, researches focused on shrimp immunity were published and a batch of related data accumulated. Several functional genes, involved in immune recognition, humoral or cellular immune response were reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. As an important part of the innate immune system, C3 is particularly crucial to determine the health status of invertebrate because they lack adaptive immune systems. Although C3 and C3 isoforms have been studied in some marine invertebrate, there are still no related reports on shrimp C3 or complement system. In this research, the expression characteristics and the role in innate immune responses of the C3 like gene in L. vannamei were analyzed. This study would help increase understanding the function of C3 gene in invertebrate immune system and give new evidence for further research on the primary complement molecules in invertebrates.</p></div>

Primers of EGFP-dsF and EGFP-dsR with T7 promoter sequences <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref> were used to amplify a 287-bp DNA fragment of EGFP gene as negative control. The PCR amplification program was as follows: denaturation at 94Â°C for 4 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94Â°C for 30 s, annealing at 57Â°C for 30 s and extension at 72Â°C for 30 s; final extension at 72Â°C for 10 min. Linear double-stranded DNA (experimental and control group)with T7 promoter sequence were synthesized. The purified PCR products were used to synthesize the corresponding dsRNAs by using In Vitro Transcription T7 Kit (TaKaRa) for in vitro transcription reaction. DNA and redundant single-strand RNA was digested by DNaseÎ™ (5U/Î¼L) and RNaseT1 (4U/Î¼L) (TaKaRa). The dsRNAs were purified by Phenol/ chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. The concentration of synthesized dsRNAs were assessed by Nanodrop 2000. In order to optimize the silencing efficiency of Lv-C3L dsRNA, 42 healthy shrimps were divided into six groups in experimental group and control group, respectively. Shrimp in each group were injected with 15 Î¼g Lv-C3L dsRNA or EGFP dsRNA for each individual. At 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h and 72 h after interference, hemocytes of seven shrimps in each group were isolated for total RNA extraction. The transcription level of Lv-C3L was detected by qPCR with primers Lv-C3L qF and Lv-C3L qR as described in Section 2.6. Differential expression between different groups were assessed by statistical significance with a t-test (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01).</p></div>

WSSV copy number analysis after silencing of Lv-C3L</head><p>In order to explore the effect of Lv-C3L silencing on WSSV propagation, 40 shrimp were divided into 2 groups including dsEGFP group and dsLv-C3L group. After optimizing of RNA interference effect, 15 Î¼g dsEGFP and 15 Î¼g dsLv-C3L was injected into each shrimp in dsEGFP group and dsLv-C3L group, respectively. At 12 h after dsRNA injection, 10 4 copies of WSSV dissolved in 10 Î¼l TN buffer were injected into each individual. Hemocytes, gill and hepatopancreas of 15 individuals from each group were collected at 36 h after WSSV injection. The samples collected from each group were divided into three subgroups and frozen in liquid nitrogen for DNA and RNA extraction and WSSV copy number analysis. DNA were extracted from hemocytes and frozen tissues by using Rapid Animal Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Sangon, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. The WSSV copy number in each DNA samples was quantified by qPCR with Gene-specific primers (W71F and W71R) and internal reference primers (TPI-qF and TPI-qR) ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) according to the method described by Xue et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. The plasmid DNA containing a 121 bp fragment of VP28 gene from WSSV was constructed and transformed into E. coli. The plasmid was then extracted and quantified, and the copy number was calculated. Standard curve was constructed using 10-fold dilutions of the plasmid DNA ranging from 10 9 to 10 3 . The qPCR was performed with the diluted plasmid DNA and the shrimp DNA under the following conditions: denaturation at 95Â°C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 95Â°C for 15 s and 60Â°C for 1 min. The WSSV copy number per microlitre of shrimp DNA was calculated based on the standard curve.</p></div>

The origin of the complement system can be traced back from deuterostomes and protostome <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>. Research on the C3 gene had revealed that C3 plays an important role in innate immune system. In vertebrates, the molecular characterization and immune function of C3 have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>. However, there are much fewer reports of complement C3 in invertebrates. Molecular structure, functional research and regulation analysis on the complement components in shrimp are especially rare and need further exploration. Here, a new C3 like gene (Lv-C3L) was identified in L. vannamei. It participates in shrimp innate immunity and is responsive to pathogen infection. The bacteriolytic activity and hemolytic activity of Lv-C3L and its function during WSSV infection were also analyzed in this research.</p><p>The structure of complement C3 can offer insights into complement activation and regulation. Lv-C3L contained a putative signal peptide without transmembrane domain, indicating that it was synthesized and glycosylated in hemocytes and secreted to hemolymph plasma. The molecular structure of the C3 gene in invertebrates included eight conservative motifs suggested by Nonaka <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Lv-C3L contained six of these motifs, including the proteolytic cleavage site of ANATO. The C3 gene was considered to originate from cnidaria when the ANATO region was inserted in the C3 sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. However, for the lower sea urchin and coral, C3 molecules do not have ANATO domain. The A2M domain may play a pivotal role by endopeptidase inhibiting protease activity through encapsulation, covalent binding and adhesion reactions. Proteins containing A2M domain share several defining properties, which include the ability to inhibit proteases from all catalytic classes, the presence of a 'bait region' and a thiol ester, a similar protease inhibitory mechanism and the inactivation of the inhibitory capacity by reaction of the thiol ester with small primary amines <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. The Î±-macroglobulin receptor (A2M_recep) domain and the Netrin C-terminal domain (C345C) did not exist in Lv-C3L. The thiol-ester region (GCGEQ) in invertebrates was described as an important motif for guiding C3 to fix on the surface of xenobiotics or pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. In mammals, The A2M and C3/C4/C5 belong to the family of thiol containing protein. This highly consistent amino acid sequence of thiol-ester region was also found in Lv-C3L. The GLN-rich region might be involved in the interaction of this protein with other members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein protein family <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> and transcriptional activation  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>. In addition to typical conservative domains, Lv-C3L also contains this particular GLN-rich region.</p><p>Function could be predicted by analyzing characteristic regions. Though some C3 factor was consisted of three disulfide-linked polypeptide chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>, most typical C3 is a Î²2 glycoprotein containing two subunit peptide chains structure (Î± and Î²) and belongs to the thioester-containing protein (TEP) superfamily <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The potential sites of Î±-Î² peptide chains junction was located in 644 RRYY 647 of Lv-C3L by sequence comparison. The Î³ peptide chains were not predicted in Lv-C3L sequence. It indicated that Lv-C3L show similar characteristics compare with normal C3 reported in other species. It was speculated that two peptides (scissions in Î±-Î² junction) exist in the mature Lv-C3L protein. The activation of the lectin pathway can lead to the activation of C3 molecule. C3a is the most important active fragment of the complement system. The C3-convertase cleavage site has been found as a conserved region (LXR) in most vertebrates. However, this site is not conserved in invertebrates, as reported for H. roretzi TSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, A. japonicas RXR <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> and S. constricta VNR <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. In the corresponding position, a "RTR" site was found in Lv-C3L. It might be involved in the formation of C-terminal residues of Lv-C3La. The alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) and the complement components C3 and C4 are related proteins derived from a common ancestor. From selacean, bony fish to higher animal, C3 gene occurred in the common ancestor of A2M. C3 were conserved throughout evolution in different species from cnidarian to human. Phylogenic analysis results showed that Lv-C3L was clustered with coelenterata A. millepora C3, which showed that they might have a close evolutionary relationship. Compare with vertebrate C3, arthropoda T. tridentatus C3 and Ammothea sp.C3 also showed close evolutionary relationship with Lv-C3L.</p><p>In order to know whether Lv-C3L was involved in immune response in shrimp, its spatial distribution and temporal expression during pathogen infection were detected. C3 protein had been produced from liver cells or macrophages in mouse or humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> and from hemocytes in Botryllus schlosseri <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>. In this research, Lv-C3L mainly expressed in hemocytes and gill constitutively. In crustaceans, hemocytes play extremely important roles in defense not only by direct sequestration and killing of infectious agents, but also by synthesis, storage and exocytosis of a battery of bioactive molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>. They could phagocytose foreign material and exert important functions in the innate immunity system. Expression of Lv-C3L protein from LVP in hemolymph revealed a similar pattern. As one of important molecules in the hemolymph, C3 might plays a crucial role in crustacean innate immunity. Gill is the first barrier to shrimp immune defense. High expression of Lv-C3L in gills of L. vannamei might be due to their immune defense function and infiltrating hemocytes in branchial filaments <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. This result indicates that it can be mainly expressed in tissues or cells which might be involved in defense response.</p><p>The complement system functions during infection and directly mediates pathogen elimination. As a major component of complement pathway in humans, C3 links innate immunity to adaptive immune system and also plays an essential role in several diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. Though the innate immunological function of C3 had been preliminarily reported by bacterial challenge, the function of C3 has not been described in detail in invertebrate. In our study, Lv-C3L showed different responses to bacteria and WSSV. In sea cucumber, AjC3-2 and AjC3 genes expression increased significantly at 6 h after the LPS challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>. The mRNA expression levels of three C3 isoforms in dojo loach were up-regulated in the gill, skin, liver and spleen after infection with Aeromonas hydrophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. A. hydrophila challenge could also resulted in significant up-regulated expression of C3 transcripts in both liver and kidney post-infection in Labeo rohita <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>. The genus Vibrio is considered to be one of most devastating pathogens among shrimp bacteria disease. V. parahaemolyticus and B.thuringensis were main pathogens of hepatopancreatic necrosis (HPNS) in L. vannamei. At 36 h and 48 h post V.parahaemolyticus infection and 24 h, 36 h, 48 h post B.thuringensis infection, the expression level of Lv-C3L gene in hemocytes was significantly upregulated. The data showed that Lv-C3L might be a midlate response gene to bacterial infection in shrimp. Moreover, there was a significant decrease of Lv-C3L expression at 60 h post bacterial infection. The possible reason for the decrease might be that proliferation of pathogenic bacteria inhibit C3 gene expression and the serpins may have controlled degradation and activity of the complement proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. In Aedes aegypti, complement-related proteins could control the flavivirus infection by inducing antimicrobial peptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. Complement factor transcripts were immunologically upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Streptococcus iniae, rock bream iridovirus (RBIV) and poly I:C in spleen tissue in rock bream <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>. In human astrocytes, immunodeficiency virus type 1 could induces expression of complement factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. However, Hepatitis B virus inhibits the expression of complement C3 and C4 in vitro and in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>. WSSV is one of the most serious viral pathogen of shrimp farming industry resulted in huge economic losses in the worldwide. In our study, at 48 h and 72 h post WSSV infection, the expression level of Lv-C3L gene in hemocytes and gill were significantly upregulated. The data indicated that Lv-C3L might be a late phase response gene to WSSV infection. These results indicated that Lv-C3L gene play a pivotal role in immune responses to the WSSV and G + /G âˆ’ bacterial infection. The different response pattern of Lv-C3L following bacterial and WSSV challenges maybe an indication that multiple response pathways exist in shrimps. Besides V. parahaemolyticus, B.thuringensis and WSSV, the expression of Lv-C3L responsive to other stimulants is worthy to further study.</p><p>Bacteriolytic and hemolytic activities of C3 protein had been analyzed in human saliva <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> and amphioxus humoral fluid <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>. The bacteriolytic activity analysis of Lv-C3L showed that LVP group and LVP plus Lv-C3L antibody group had significant bacteriolysis, and the bacteriostatic effect of LVP group was more obvious than that of the LVP plus Lv-C3L antibody group. Moreover, both of V.parahaemolyticus and V.anguillarum analysis groups still expressed bacteriolytic activities when Lv-C3L proteins were inhibited by its antibody. These results indicated the effective immune function of Lv-C3L in bacteriolysis. There may be other bacteriolytic factors in LVP, such as antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme and isoforms of Lv-C3L. Counts of bacterium in all groups increased after 1 h ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7A and B)</ref>. It was considered that Lv-C3L and other proteins might consumed by bacterium and lose bacteriolytic ability. Hemolysis is a crucial experiment to identify the function of C3 in invertebrates. Comparing with results of bacteriolytic analysis, similar result was obtained in hemolytic activity analysis of Lv-C3L. Furthermore, Lv-C3L protein is a heat-labile protein just like C3 from other species <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref> and needs to be activated by antigen like LPS or bacterium <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref>. After Lv-C3L restrained by its antibody in "Lv-C3L antibody + LPS + LVP" group, the hemolysis was still observed in experiments though the hemolysis rate was lower than that of the "LPS + LVP" group. It indicated that some other factors with hemolytic activity which had similar function to Lv-C3L exist in LVP and were activated by LPS. The gap between two groups may indicate the hemolytic activity of Lv-C3L. The above results revealed that Lv-C3L plays a vital role in bacteriolysis and hemolysis during innate immune response.</p><p>Combining WSSV copy number analysis with WSSV-VP28 gene expression profile analysis, interference of Lv-C3L gene by double-strand RNA could obviously promote the in vivo propagation of WSSV in shrimp. It can be inferred that Lv-C3L could inhibit the replication of WSSV in shrimp. Similarly, cumulative mortality in the Lv-C3L dsRNA group by WSSV infection was significantly higher than that in control group (EGFP dsRNA). Though previous studies showed that complement-related proteins could control the virus infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, this is the first report in crustaceans that Lv-C3L is involved in antiviral immune response. These results collectively suggested that Lv-C3L may play an important protective role against WSSV and activation of complement pathway including C3 could restrict the propagation of WSSV in shrimp. In conclusion, a novel complement C3 like gene (Lv-C3L) with full-length cDNA sequence was identified in shrimp L. vannamei in the present study. Its phylogenetic pattern, expression profile in healthy tissues and in pathogen challenged, bacteriolytic and hemolytic activities were also explored. Lv-C3L was responsive to V. parahaemolyticus, B.thuringensis and WSSV infection and could regulate the in vivo propagation of WSSV. This is the first report on key complement components in shrimp. It is speculated that complicated complement response cascade may exist in shrimp. These results collectively indicated that the complement pathway in shrimp might participate in bacterial and WSSV infection. Further research on the identification of molecular mechanism concerning C3 deposition on bacteria and WSSV, membrane rupture and the special complement pathway are in progress. These studies would help increase understanding the function of C3 gene in invertebrate immune system and give new evidence for further research on the primary complement molecules in invertebrates.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>.

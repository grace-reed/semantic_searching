			<abstract>
				<p>The phylum of dinoflagellates is characterized by many unusual and interesting genomic and physiological features, the imprint of which, in its immense genome, remains elusive. Much novel understanding has been achieved in the last decade on various aspects of dinoflagellate biology, but most remarkably about the structure, expression pattern and epigenetic modification of protein-coding genes in the nuclear and organellar genomes. Major findings include: 1) the great diversity of dinoflagellates, especially at the base of the dinoflagellate tree of life; 2) mini-circularization of the genomes of typical dinoflagellate plastids (with three membranes, chlorophylls a, c1 and c2, and carotenoid peridinin), the scrambled mitochondrial genome and the extensive mRNA editing occurring in both systems; 3) ubiquitous spliced leader transsplicing of nuclear-encoded mRNA and demonstrated potential as a novel tool for studying dinoflagellate transcriptomes in mixed cultures and natural assemblages; 4) existence and expression of histones and other nucleosomal proteins; 5) a ribosomal protein set expected of typical eukaryotes; 6) genetic potential of non-photosynthetic solar energy utilization via proton-pump rhodopsin; 7) gene candidates in the toxin synthesis pathways; and 8) evidence of a highly redundant, high gene number and highly recombined genome. Despite this progress, much more work awaits genome-wide transcriptome and whole genome sequencing in order to unfold the molecular mechanisms underlying the numerous mysterious attributes of dinoflagellates.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Dinoflagellates a unique and important group of eukaryotes</head><p>Dinoflagellates are a phylum of unicellular eukaryotes, mostly 10e100 mm in size, living in both marine and freshwater ecosystems. Dinoflagellates are characterized by two flagella and the unique cell covering (theca) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The flagella facilitate motility of the cells, with one rooted in the sulcus (longitudinal groove) that steers the cell and the other rooted in the cingulum (transverse groove) that propels the cell. Underneath the cell membrane are flattened vesicles (amphiesma), which are filled by cellulose to be fortified thecal plates in the majority of lineages and are void of cellulose in some (mainly Gymnodiniale) lineages (athecate or naked species).</p><p>Dinoflagellates belong to the crown group Alveolata that also comprises the phyla Ciliophora and Apicomplexa <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C)</ref>.</p><p>Ciliates, like dinoflagellates, are common aquatic protists but are heterotrophic (important micrograzers) or parasitic with a few exceptions (plastid-containing taxa like Messodinium rubrum). Apicomplexans are exclusively animal parasites (exemplified by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum). Dinoflagellates are the most important eukaryotic primary producers in the ocean other than diatoms. A symbiotic lineage (Symbiodinium) is essential to coral reef growth. Dinoflagellates form red tides, over 60 of which produce toxins, and thereby have profound impacts on the fisheries industry, recreational values of coastal zones and public health.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Phylogeny and diversity</head><p>In alveolates, dinoflagellates form a monophyletic group and are closest to apicomplexans <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>). Fossil evidence shows that dinoflagellates emerged in the Silurian period (400 MYA) or earlier, and major radiation seemed to occur in the Triassic onward with abundant thecate lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fensome et al., 1999)</ref>. The latest lineage is probably Alexandrium tamarense, which emerged approximately 23e45 MYA <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(John et al., 2010)</ref>. Dinoflagellates consist of eight major classes, Gonyaulacales, Prorocentrales, Gymnodiniales, Peridiniales, Suessiales, Noctilucales, Syndiniales and Blastodiniales. The most basal lineage and the evolutionary relationship of these classes are still unresolved, with the latter raising questions as to whether these classes emerged about the same time during the major radiation period <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hoppenrath and Leander, 2010)</ref>. Since marine alveolates group (MAG) I and II were first detected in picoplankton <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Lopez-Garcia et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Moon-van der Staay et al., 2001)</ref>, novel lineages of dinoflagellates continue to be discovered. During 2004e2006 alone, one new family, 12 new genera and 27 new species were described <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Taylor et al., 2008)</ref>. It is now clear that MAGII belong to Amoebophrya and related taxa that comprise Syndiniales, whereas MAGI are related to parasites of tintinnids, copepods and fish eggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Harada et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Skovgaard and Daugbjerg, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Skovgaard et al., 2009)</ref>. These new findings widen the gap between the 'core' (dinokaryotic) dinoflagellates and apicomplexans <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C)</ref>, and bring into question the lineage that constitutes the base of the dinoflagellate phylum. The genus Oxyrrhis used to be considered a pre-dinoflagellate lineage <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Saunders et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Saldarriaga et al., 2003)</ref>, followed by Noctiluca scintillans, which is now found to be closer to MAGI and II <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gómez et al., 2010)</ref>. These have been supported by their non-dinokaryotic nucleus in the whole (O. marina) or partial (N. scintillans) life history and phylogenetic placement based on various genes.</p><p>Within the 'core' (dinokaryotic) dinoflagellate group, the genus Symbiodinium is positioned basal in phylogenetic trees inferred from mitochondrial (mt) cytochrome B and cytochrome C oxidase subunit I, in combination with 18S rDNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Zhang et al., 2007a)</ref>. Surprisingly, the perinidiniale Heterocapsa spp. came out as basal as Symbiodinium in these trees. While this requires scrutiny with more genes, it is supported by mt gene RNA editing data. Overall, dinoflagellates host the greatest range of RNA editing types known to any eukaryotes, but its extent (portion of nucleotides that undergoes editing) displays a phylogenetic trend (see below for more information). No RNA editing was found in Oxyrrhis and Noctiluca, as in apicomplexans and ciliates, a low extent was found in Heterocapsa and Symbiodinium, and a higher extent in later-diverging dinoflagellates (e.g. Prorocentrum, Karlodinium). The recent discovery of a spliced leader (SL) in nuclear-encoded proteincoding genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Zhang et al., 2007b</ref>; see below for more information) provides another tool to distinguish dinoflagellates from other organisms. The presence of both mt RNA editing and dinoflagellate-specific spliced leader (DinoSL) would mark 'core' dinoflagellates, while the absence of RNA editing with the presence of DinoSL would mark basal dinoflagellate lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Zhang and Lin, 2008)</ref>. These hallmarks of dinoflagellates can be useful in determining whether novel or unstudied lineages belong to dinoflagellates, such as MAGI, MAGII and perkinsids. Amoebophrya nuclear mRNA contains SL <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bachvaroff et al., 2009)</ref>, suggestive of its dinoflagellate identity, but its SL sequence and mRNA editing status remain to be determined.</p><p>The oyster 'dermo' disease pathogen Perkinsus marinus and related species have unresolved phylogenetic affiliation. This lineage appears to be an apicomplexan (review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Perkins, 1996)</ref>, a dinoflagellate <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Perkins, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Saldarriaga et al., 2003)</ref> and a separate lineage altogether, Perkinsizoa <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Norén et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Figueroa et al., 2008)</ref> based on conflicting morphological and molecular signals. Recent studies show that it possesses SL trans-splicing machinery, indicative of affinity with dinoflagellates, but it has two types of SL, and the SL and coding gene sequences are different from those in typical dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Zhang et al., 2011a)</ref>. Analysis of mt cox1 revealed the absence of mRNA editing in this lineage. More strikingly, mt cob and cox1 could not be translated unless anomalous frameshifts were introduced (as if AGGY codes for glycine and CCCCU for proline) <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(Zhang et al., 2011b</ref> and references therein). These characteristics place perkinsids as a unique lineage separated from dinoflagellates. Undoubtedly, many more novel dinoflagellate species will be found and the diversity of this phylum will prove to be much higher than currently known. This area of research has never been so dynamic and exciting as it is today. DNA bar coding, as explored recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Litaker et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Lin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Stern et al., 2010)</ref>, is promising as an effective tool for recovering the biodiversity of dinoflagellates quickly if a database is established.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Cell covering</head><p>Nanoidentation tests show that the dinoflagellate theca has similar mechanical properties to the cell wall of softwood, as demonstrated in Alexandrium catenella and Lingulodinium polyedrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Lau et al., 2007)</ref>. Regardless of thecate or athecate taxa, dinoflagellates share alveoli (amphiesma) with apicomplexa, ciliates, perkinsids and other alveolates. A common protein of these alveoli is alveolin <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gould et al., 2008)</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. A 43 kDa cell surface protein has been found in the gonyaulocoid Lingulodinium polyedrum <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bertomeu et al., 2003)</ref> and a homolog also identified in the transcriptome of a freshwater pond plankton where gonyaulacoid Ceratium hirundiella was dominant, suggesting that this protein may be common in gonyaulacoid or even all dinoflagellates . From the cDNA libraries of K. brevis, I found a homolog of cellulose synthase (EX968983, CO062648), an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cellulose, the main component of thecal plates. Furthermore, cellulase, the enzyme hydrolyzing cellulose also exists in the dinoflagellate cell wall, and its activity peaks in the G2/M phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kwok and Wong, 2010)</ref>, suggesting that it is required for cytokinesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Diverse trophic modes and plastid evolution</head><p>Trophic modes of dinoflagellates are especially complex: about 50% of them are photoautotrophic (e.g. Prorocentrum) and the other 50% are heterotrophic (e.g. Pfiesteria), with many species being mixotrophic (e.g. Karlodinium). The mixotrophic taxa represent the majority of toxic species producing various toxins <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hallegraeff, 1995)</ref>. A recent survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Tang et al., 2010)</ref> showed that most dinoflagellate taxa relied on exogenous vitamins (B1, B7, and B12), which probably explains why axenic dinoflagellate cultures are generally difficult to grow. The tight association of dinoflagellates and bacteria has caused suspicion that toxins in some of these cultures might be produced by the associated bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Gallacher et al., 1997)</ref>. Heterotrophic species of dinoflagellates ingest other algae or dissolved organic matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Schnepf and Elbrachter, 1999)</ref>, and some can enslave ingested algal chloroplasts and perform ephemeral photosynthesis (kleptoplastidic, e.g. Pfiesteria piscicida; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Feinstein et al., 2002)</ref>. Heterotrophic and mixotrophic dinoflagellates engulf whole cell prey or suck prey's intracellular content via a peduncle (a straw-like tubing). What makes up the peduncle, what regulates its firing and retraction and how food transfer is operated are unknown. No grazing-related genes have been systematically studied. In a recent environmentally derived dinoflagellate-specific metatranscriptome , a dinoflagellate cDNA (ML1_1061048825027) was identified coding for a protein similar to a putative epn3 protein, a component of the endocytosis pathway known in mammals (KEGG; http://apropos.mcw.edu/kegg_pathways/04144/rat). Another protein (ML1_1061048824966) from the same cDNA library hit endocytosis-related protein, clathrin assembly protein ap19, with significant e value (E À52). Whether these proteins are involved in grazing regulation remains to be investigated. Taxa from the orders Syndiniales and Blastodiniales are obligate parasites.

The significant representation of parasitic lineages in dinoflagellates (including MAGI) and ciliates, as well as the obligate parasitism of apicomplexans, suggest that dinoflagellates may be an excellent model for studying the gain or loss of parasitism.</p><p>Dinoflagellate plastids have a complex evolutionary history <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Schnepf and Elbrachter, 1999)</ref>. Typical dinoflagellate plastids contain chlorophylls a and c as major pigments, peridinin as the major carotenoid, and three membranes. These plastids utilize form II Rubisco of proteobacterial origin likely acquired through lateral gene transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Morse et al., 1995)</ref>. In atypical dinoflagellate plastids, diverse in origin, the peridinincontaining plastid is replaced, presumably through tertiary endosymbiosis, by a plastid originating from haptophyte, as in Gymnodiniale lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Tengs et al., 2000)</ref> and cryptophyte as in Dinophysis spp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hackett et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Janson, 2004)</ref> or through another secondary endosymbiosis of a green alga, as in Lepidodinium chlorophorum <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Takishita et al., 2008)</ref> and L. viridae <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hansen et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Plastids in Dinophysis spp. seem to be particularly complex. Some originated from cyanobacteria or haptophyte, and others from cryptophytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Koike et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Escalera et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hackett et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Janson, 2004)</ref>. Whether these Dinophysis plastids are permanent or transient is being debated. A D. acuminata transcriptome sequenced on a larger scale than done for other dinoflagellates in which most plastid-maintaining genes were retrieved shows only a small number of plastid-maintaining genes, leading to the conclusion that D. acuminata only maintains a temporary plastid "stolen" from the prey, i.e. a kleptoplast <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Wisecaver and Hackett, 2010)</ref>. Other studies using both ultrastructural and molecular analyses suggest that Dinophysis has a permanent plastid (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Garcia-Cuetos et al., 2010)</ref>. In addition, Kryptoperidinium foliaceum habors a diatom symbiont, the plastid and nucleus of which both exist in the dinoflagellate cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(McEwan and Keeling, 2004)</ref>. Mitochondrial genes of both the host and symbiont are present and expressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Imanian and Keeling, 2007)</ref>, as are proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from both nuclei <ref type="bibr">(Hou and Lin, unpublished data)</ref>. Deep transcriptomic or genomic sequencing would help us to understand how the dinoflagellate regulates expression and coordinates function of the two sets of genes and orchestrates the cell division. Such studies have been hampered by the unavailability of stable cultures of Dinophysis until recent success at cultivating these species using Mesodinium rubrum fed on cryptophytes as the deliverer of the cryptophyte prey <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Park et al., 2006)</ref>. The fact that Dinophysis cannot grow photosynthetically raises questions on whether these dinoflagellates really have fully functional chloroplasts. The fact that it needs the ciliate as an intermediate to acquire the prey also suggests that Dinophysis probably misses some critical enzymes to initially process the prey. In addition, Kryptoperidinium foliaceum habors a diatom symbiont, the plastid and nucleus of which both exist in the dinoflagellate cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(McEwan and Keeling, 2004)</ref>. Mitochondrial genes of both the host and symbiont are present and expressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Imanian and Keeling, 2007)</ref>, as are proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from both nuclei <ref type="bibr">(Hou and Lin, unpublished data)</ref>. Deep transcriptomic or genomic sequencing would help us to understand how the dinoflagellate regulates expression and coordinates function of the two sets of genes and orchestrates the cell division cycle of the two systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Dinoflagellate nuclear genomes: genome size, gene content, and nucleosomal proteins</head><p>The most striking feature of dinoflagellates is their enormous and widely varied genomes, w3e245 giga bp (Gb) of DNA held in from several to &gt;100 chromosomes. It represents 1-to 80-fold as much as a human haploid genome. This is in contrast to the majority of eukaryotic algae, whose genome sizes typically range from tens to hundreds of million bp (Mb) <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Veldhuis et al., 1997)</ref>. Under an epifluorescence microscope, chromosomes in a relatively small (w10 Gb in Karlodinium veneficum) dinoflagellate genome can be seen after DAPI staining <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. As in other eukaryotes, dinoflagellate genome size exhibits a positive correlation with cell size <ref type="bibr">(Hou, 2008 and references therein)</ref>. This correlation is consistent with the "adaptive" theory of genome size evolution: larger genomes directly or indirectly increase nuclear and cellular volumes and help to buffer fluctuations in the concentration of regulatory proteins or protect coding DNA from mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Petrov, 2001)</ref>. Dinoflagellate nuclear DNA is extensively methylated. Previous studies showed that 12e70% of thymine is replaced by 5-hydroxymethyluracil and varying levels of methylation occur to cytosine ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>. The genes involved in regulating methylation are unclear but some potential genes have been identified. The gene coding for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase (sam) has been identified in some dinoflagellates in the context of saxitoxin synthesis which involves methyl transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Harlow et al., 2007)</ref>. In addition, this gene itself is methylated and inhibition of its methylation causes arrest of the cell cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ho et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>DNA in dinoflagellates occurs in a liquid crystalline state <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bouligand and Norris, 2001)</ref>, and chromosomes are permanently condensed, with a "banded" appearance under the electron microscope <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Rizzo, 1987)</ref>. Little is known about how dinoflagellate chromosomes are organized. With the exception of some basal lineages (e.g. Amoebophrya), dinoflagellates have been thought to lack histone proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Rizzo, 1987)</ref> and to use histonelike proteins for DNA organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Wong et al., 2003)</ref>. This notion was challenged when histones H3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Okamoto and Hastings, 2003)</ref> and 2A.X were detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hackett et al., 2005)</ref>, and is now fully rejected because all four core nucleosomal histones (H2A.X, H2B, H3, and H4), along with histone deacetylase and nucleosome assembly protein, have been found in dinoflagellates <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>. Recently, an H1-type linker histone-like protein was also identified in A. catenella <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Toulza et al., 2010)</ref>. Histones were not found earlier, probably because they are expressed in low amounts overall or only in a certain phase of the cell cycle. The former is more likely, because dinoflagellate genomes have a low protein content (10:1 of DNA:protein ratio in the chromatin). It is possible that the canonical histones only form nucleosomes in some part of the genome, as in spermatozoa in many species <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Postberg et al., 2010)</ref>, or they could complement basic nuclear proteins in configuring the chromosomes. Work is now required to characterize the expression pattern of the histones in the cell cycle. Histone-like proteins have been found to be upregulated in G1 in some species, but in S phase in others (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Wong and Kwok, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alverca et al. (2007)</ref> recently found telomeres in chromosomes in Prorocentrum minimum and Amphidinium carterae. The telomere is a region of repetitive DNA at the ends of a chromosome in most eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, which protects the ends of the chromosome from deterioration. When a cell divides, the chromosomes are naturally shortened, so the telomere serves as a buffer to prevent the loss of the genes at the ends of the chromosomes. The telomere is consumed during cell division and is replenished by telomerase reverse transcriptase. In animal cells, it sets the limit on the number of divisions for each somatic cell and hence is related to ageing and life span. What function this interesting region of DNA encodes in dinoflagellates remains to be studied.</p><p>Evolutionarily, dinoflagellate nuclear genomes are highly dynamic. They have acquired plastid targeted genes via successive horizontal gene transfer from the peridinin plastid, the tertiary replacement plastid and its host nucleus, cyanobacteria, red algae, green algae, haptophyte and even bacteria, giving rise to a highly chimeric nuclear genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Yoon et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Patron et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Nosenko et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Waller et al., 2006)</ref>. Furthermore, apparent rampant gene or segmental/ whole genome duplications <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hou and Lin, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Van Dolah et al., 2009)</ref>, and possible retroposition of cDNA to the genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Slamovits and Keeling, 2008)</ref> likely contribute to the high copy number of genes and expansion of the genomes. Based on genome size and predicted gene numbers of sequenced genomes, gene number and genome size exhibits a very tight logelog linear relationship in prokaryotes and viruses, but a logelog semi-ln relationship in eukaryotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hou and Lin, 2009)</ref>. Extrapolated from the latter, it was predicted that dinoflagellate genomes might host 38,188e87,688 protein-coding (40,086e92,013 total, including rRNA and tRNA) genes, accounting for 1.8%e0.05% of total genomic DNA in the respective species. Dinoflagellate EST (DinoEST, see below) data so far shows at least nearly 12,000 unique genes in a dinoflagellate genome with &lt;10 pg of DNA (K. veneficum) <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Patron et al., 2006)</ref>, and about 40,000 in A. tamarense of about 200 pg DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Moustafa et al., 2010)</ref>. These estimates, high compared to other eukaryotes, are still lower than what the model predicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hou and Lin, 2009)</ref>, in part because an EST dataset does not include genes not expressed at the time of sampling, and because the sequencing depth in these projects was still inadequate to retrieve all expressed genes. Given the high gene copy numbers in dinoflagellates found so far, these protein numbers likely represent a highly redundant proteome. Despite the high gene copy numbers, the dinoflagellate genomes are mostly (98.20e99.95%) non-coding DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hou and Lin, 2009)</ref>. In accordance, a preliminary genome survey shows that the Heterocapsa triquetra genome contains high amount of repetitive non-coding DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(McEwan et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>6. Cis-splicing and spliced leader trans-splicing</p><p>For the limited number of genes analyzed in dinoflagellates, introns are not so common and those that occur often deviate from the GT/AG rule. Luciferase C in Lingulodinium poledrum contains one intron <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Okomoto et al., 2001</ref>). The gene coding for the CO -fixing enzyme Rubisco has no intron in P. minium <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Zhang and Lin, 2003)</ref> but eight introns in Symbiodinium sp., seven of which have GA or GC instead of GT at the boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Rowan et al., 1996)</ref>.

In an analysis of 31 genes in Amphidinium carterae, 48% of them were found to contain introns <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bachvaroff and Place, 2008)</ref>, the highest rate for dinoflagellates documented to date. The real frequency of introns in dinoflagellate nuclear genes remains to be determined with more systematic surveys. Nevertheless, as demonstrated in 19 dinoflagellate species (from basal lineages such as Oxyrrhis marina, Noctiluca scintillans, Amoebophrya to later-diverging lineages such as Prorocentrum minimum, Alexandrium fundyense), it appears that spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing is ubiquitous in dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Zhang et al., 2007b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Zhang et al., , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lidie and Van Dolah, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Monroe and Van Dolah, 2008)</ref>.

Homologs of this and related proteins have been identified in recent dinoflagellate transcriptomes (e.g. cDNA dataset in <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Toulza et al., 2010)</ref>. Transcriptional regulation is quite limited in dinoflagellates. A microarray analysis on Karenia brevis revealed that about 10% of genes were transcriptionally regulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Lidie et al., 2005)</ref>. Massively parallel signature sequencing studies showed that 10%e27% of the detected cDNA pools of two Alexandrium species were regulated transcriptionally <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Erdner and Anderson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Moustafa et al., 2010)</ref>. A metatranscriptomic analysis without normalization exhibited strikingly even levels of transcript abundance for the majority of the cDNAs detected, for all three (one marine and two freshwater) samples, with only a small number of genes showing markedly higher transcript levels . Given that histones play a key role in regulation of gene transcription in eukaryotes, the scarcity of transcriptional regulation is consistent with the lower abundance of histones in dinoflagellates. The majority of genes in dinoflagellates must be regulated translationally or posttranslationally. Protein phosphorylation, methylation, and sumoylation (by small ubiquitin-like modifier) are widely recognized as important modification processes regulating protein activity in eukaryotes, but their potential roles in dinoflagellate gene regulation remain largely unexplored. Of the small proportion of genes that are transcriptionally regulated, those highly expressed are of particular interest but have not been given much attention. A small number of genes are highly represented in the EST datasets reported recently, e.g. K. brevis <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Lidie et al., 2005)</ref> and A. catenella <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Uribe et al., 2008)</ref>. In the latter case, the cDNA library was dominated by 17 genes, of which luciferin binding protein accounted for 15.6%, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase 4.9%, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isoform 2 (GPDH) 3.7%, and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 3%.  compared the sequenced cDNA libraries derived from two freshwater and one marine natural plankton assemblages along with the existing DinoEST dataset to look for common genes. As a result, five proteins, major basic nuclear protein, ubiquitin, centrin/caltractin, calmodulin and 14-3-3, were found to be common and highly expressed in both the cultured and wild dinoflagellate assemblages <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5)</ref>. A literature survey shows that some of these and other genes are highly expressed in at least three dinoflagellate cultures: SAM synthetase, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (¼S-adenosylhomocysteinase), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, peridinin-chlorophyll-binding protein, heat shock proteins 90, 70, and 40, elongation factor 1a and calmodulin <ref type="table">(Table 5</ref>). These genes are important in methylation (e.g. DNA and toxin precursors), carbohydrate metabolism, light harvesting, stress response, translation and signal transduction. In addition, the analysis of the environmental cDNA and DinoEST datasets yields a set of 79 ribosomal proteins that commonly occur in eukaryotes , some of which have been reported to be highly represented in DinoEST.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Mitochondrial genome</head><p>Attempts to sequence and reconstruct dinoflagellate mt genomes have been met by frustration due to abundant noncoding and repetitive sequences as well as AT-rich DNA. Gene annotation is often challenging due to lack of canonical start and stop signals, presence of stop codons in the coding region and scrambled gene fragments. Substantial progress has been made in recent years, however, yielding intriguing results (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Lin et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Waller and Jackson, 2009)</ref>. Like their closest relative apicomplexans, dinoflagellates have a highly reduced mt genome, which only codes for three proteins (cob, cox1, cox3) and two fragmented rRNAs. Cox2, which is encoded in mitochondria in almost all other eukaryotes, has apparently transferred to the nuclear genome  <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Waller and Jackson, 2009)</ref>. Dinoflagellate mt gene translation must rely on tRNA imported from the cytoplasm entirely, as in apicomplexans. Like the nuclear genome, the mt genome in dinoflagellates is also highly duplicated and recombined. All five genes occur in multiple (up to 10 distinct) copies, frequently disrupted by fragments of other genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Waller and Jackson, 2009</ref>; Lin and Zhang unpublished observations). The internal stop codon (TGA) requires either its diversion or RNA editing (e.g. to TGG) to sensible codons, e.g. tryptophan or serine <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Lin et al., 2002)</ref>.

Within a species, all minicircules share a conserved core in the non-coding region that may contain transcription initiation signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Howe et al., 2008)</ref>. Replication of the minicircles is by a 'rolling circle' instead of replication bubbles, which produces transcripts longer than the coding DNA requiring cleavage to yield mature RNA (Dang and Green, 2010). A recent study showed circumstantial evidence that some of the minicircular sequences might have been translocated to the nuclear genome in Ceratium horridum <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Laatsch et al., 2004)</ref>. No gene transcripts in the peridinin plastid are found polyadenylated, but polyuridinylation occurs at least in some species <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Wang and Morse, 2006)</ref>.

The genes encoded in the plastid genome are related to photosynthesis, including the core subunits of the photosystem, cytochrome b6f, and ATP synthase complex <ref type="bibr">(atpA, atpB, petB, petD, psaA, psaB, psbA-E, psbI)</ref> and four other proteins (ycf16, ycf24, rpl28, and rpl23). The remaining genes required for photosynthesis have migrated to the nuclear genome. These include the CO 2 -fixing enzyme Rubisco, likely originated from bacteria (form II) through horizontal gene transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Morse et al., 1995)</ref>. The dinoflagellate form II Rubisco gene exists in multiple copies arranged in tandem, triple tandem repeats in Symbiodinium <ref type="bibr">(Rowan et al., 1995)</ref> and quadruple tandem repeats in Prorocentrum minimum <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Zhang and Lin, 2003)</ref>. In P. minimum, many copies of this gene are located in a multitude of 4-tandem-repeat transcript units (likely on separate chromosomes), each of which is translated to a polyprotein <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5A)</ref>. The polyprotein appears to be cleaved to expose the interprotein spacer similar to a signal peptide at the N terminus of a single protein, which presumably guides the import of the protein to the plastid where the cleavage of the spacer results in single-unit, functional, Rubisco <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5A)</ref>.</p><p>The atypical dinoflagellate plastids, of haptophyte, cryptophyte or prasinophyte origins, are presumed to have more typical algal plastid genomes. They possess form I Rubisco (large and small subunits) encoded in the plastid genome, as in their progenitor plastid genomes. However, similar to peridinin plastids, many genes from these atypical plastids have been lost to their respective nuclear genomes. As a result, the nuclear genomes in these lineages are highly chimeric with genes from plastids and host nuclei of ancestral plastids (endosymbionts). In Karlodinium veneficum, for instance, the plastid targeted nuclearencoded genes retrieved from an EST dataset are of haptophyte, peridinin dinoflagellate plastid and other origins <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Patron et al., 2005)</ref>. In Karenia brevis, an EST dataset reveals 30 plastid targeted genes in the nuclear genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Nosenko et al., 2006)</ref>. Of these, 13 are derived by the chromalveolate ancestor from its red algal endosymbiont, 6 from green algae and 3 have arisen through the duplication of genes encoding cytosolic proteins in the ancestral chromalveolate. Similarly, the green plastid containing the Lepidodinium chlorophorum nuclear genome also harbored plastid targeted genes of diverse origins: peridinin dinoflagellate, streptophyte, heterokont, red algae, green algae and unknown sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Minge et al., 2010)</ref>.

When mapping the proportion of the nucleotides that are A) rbcL occurs in numerous copies in the genome organized as four tandem repeat transcribed units (TU1, 2, .37). Each TU is transcribed to an mRNA, transported to the cytoplasm where it is translated to a tetrameric polyprotein. Presumably, the polyprotein is cleaved to a single Rubisco attached by a signal peptide at the N terminus, which is imported to the chloroplast where the cleavage of the signal peptide yields a mature Rubisco. B) Contrasting organizations of lcf and lbp in Linguludinium polyedrum and Noctiluca scintillans. In L. polyedrum, lcf occurs as tandem-repeat multicopy genes linked by an intergenic region (thin line). In each copy, there are three similar domains in the coding region that, when expressed independently, are all catalytically active. The lbp is organized in a similar fashion, but appears to have four domains in the coding region; the N terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence is similar (homologous) to the corresponding region in lcf.

This has been linked to the huge genomes that require a long time to duplicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Tang, 1996)</ref>. However, genome size seems to only account for a small fraction of the variation in growth rate and slow growth is also attributable to low chlorophyll to carbon ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Tang, 1996)</ref>. Dinoflagellate cells divide with closed mitosis and extranuclear spindles, and chromosomes are permanently condensed. Like typical eukaryotes, dinoflagellate cell division cycle consists of G1, S, G2, and M phases. The cell division cycle in dinoflagellates is tightly phased to the light dark cycle and is synchronous, with mitosis (M) occurring mostly in the dark period. Cell division leads to population growth, which is critical to the formation of harmful algal blooms. As eukaryotes, dinoflagellates are expected to have cyclins and cyclindependent kinases (CDKs) as the core cell cycle regulatory engine to control major transition points and proliferating cell nuclear antigen as an essential accessory protein of DNA polymerase d and e functioning in the S phase and DNA repair.

In contrast to the invariable abundance of the cyclin B-like protein in K. brevis, the abundance of the mitotic cyclin in L. polyedrum was dramatically higher in the G2 than in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

The high copy numbers of both lcf and lbp may have resulted from the requirement of high abundance of these proteins in bioluminescence that select for retaining of the duplicated gene copies. Interestingly, a recent study shows that, in the heterotrophic and basal dinoflagellate N. sintillans, lcf and lbp homologs are clustered as one transcribed unit containing the lcf and lbp domains linked to a short spacer, and the cluster is repeated <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Liu and Hastings, 2007)</ref>. The lcf domain is similar to the second domain of the lcf gene in L. polyedrum (only missing three histones in the N terminus), whereas the lbp domain contains the whole lbp gene in L. polyedrum <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5B)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to bioluminescence, circadian rhythm has been observed in other processes in dinoflagellates. Cell division, for instance, is usually entrained by the light dark cycle and shows circadian rhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Sweeney and Hastings, 1958)</ref>. In dinoflagellates, mitosis usually occurs in the dark period near dawn and the S phase at dusk or the early dark period. Even if only a fraction of the cell population divides each day, division is gated to a fixed time of the day. In K. brevis, the cell cycle seems to respond to a dark light cue and cell division is phased to the late dark period; a cryptochrome blue light receptor is suspected to serve as a dawn cue receiver in the circadian rhythm pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brunelle et al., 2007)</ref>. Using microarray, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Okamoto and Hastings (2003)</ref> found that 3% of the 2800 Pyrocystis lunula genes included in the analysis exhibited 2-or more fold variations in transcript abundance over the <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> Genes found to be highly expressed in at least three of the existing cDNA libraries of dinoflagellates. Species circadian cycle. None of the canonical core clock genes characterized in other systems, such as frq and per, were found in this gene set, suggesting that dinoflagellates probably use different clock machinery. Synthesis of the nuclear-encoded plastid protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was translationally regulated to exhibit circadian rhythms <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fagan et al., 1999)</ref>. A type-1 phosphoprotein phosphatase is suspected to be a component of the circadian mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Comolli et al., 2003)</ref>. As transcriptional regulation in dinoflagellates is generally scarce, identification of the whole set of circadian clock genes may require search at posttranscriptional levels.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="14.">Toxin synthesis</head><p>Dinoflagellates are the greatest contributors to harmful algal blooms and biotoxins in the ocean. Toxins produced by dinoflagellates (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Wang, 2008)</ref> are responsible for all but one of the classical seafood poisoning syndromes, paralytic (PSP), diarrhetic (DSP), neurotoxic (NSP) and azaspiracid shellfish poisoning (AZP), and ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP). The only exception is amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), which is caused by the diatom Pseudonitzschia spp.. Toxin-producing taxa do not seem to show a phylogenetic trend <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Zhang et al., 2007a</ref>), suggesting multiple independent evolutionary origins for this capability (including horizontal gene transfer) or multiple losses of the capacity in descendants of a toxin-producing ancestor.</p><p>Paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs) are small heterocyclic guanidinium alkaloids, with saxitoxin (STX) as the basic form and 58 other analogs documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Wiese et al., 2010)</ref>. It is believed that PSTs are synthesized via a pathway involving arginine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and acetate, and the methyl group of SAM is incorporated into the final PST molecule (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Shimizu, 1996)</ref>. Therefore, SAM synthetase is likely to play a key role in STX biosynthesis. Interestingly, the expression of SAM synthase in the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii is slightly upregulated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ho et al., 2007)</ref>, in coincidence with higher saxitoxin production in this phase in Alexandrium fundyense <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Taroncher-Oldenburg et al., 1997)</ref>. Using degenerate primers in PCR, homologs of SAM synthetase gene were identified from 11 species of dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Harlow et al., 2007)</ref>, but not only PSTproducing species. The STX synthesis pathway in dinoflagellates is elusive. In the PST-producing cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, the STX biosynthetic pathway is encoded by more than 35 kb, which contains 30 catalytic functions in 26 proteins (sxtAesxtZ ) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>. STX biosynthesis is initiated with arginine, S-adenosylmethionine and acetate by a new type of polyketide synthase, followed by three heterocyclizations and various tailoring reactions to yield the numerous isoforms of saxitoxin <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kellmann et al., 2008)</ref>. A comparative phylogenomic analysis for toxic and non-toxic strains of Anabaena circinalis and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii revealed that nine of the 26 putative STX genes were horizontally transferred from non-cyanobacterial sources, whereas one key gene (sxtA) originated in STX þ cyanobacteria via two independent horizontal transfers followed by fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Moustafa et al., 2010)</ref>. Whether STX-producing dinoflagellates use some of these genes and whether they acquired these genes through horizontal gene transfer are currently under investigation.</p><p>Other dinoflagellate toxins are derivatives of polyketide. Essentially a polyether ring ladder <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 8A)</ref>, polyketide synthesis requires sequential extension of the C backbone, which is catalyzed by a polyketide synthase (PKS) system. There are three types of PKSs (for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Snyder et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Monroe and Van Dolah, 2008)</ref>. Type I PKSs are large multifunctional enzymes in which several catalytic domains are located on a single protein <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 8B)</ref>. These functional domains may be used iteratively (fungal PKSs) or they can be arranged into modules with each module directing one round of chain extension (b-ketoacyl synthase [KS] domain) and postcondensation modifications (b-ketoacyl reductase <ref type="bibr">[KR]</ref>, dehydratase <ref type="bibr">[DH]</ref>, and enoyl reductase <ref type="bibr">[ER]</ref>). Type II PKSs are multiprotein complexes of several individual enzymes, are found only in bacteria and code for aromatic polyketides. The individual enzymes of type II PKSs are used repetitively for each cycle of chain extension. Type III PKSs are smaller PKSs (40e47 kDa) and are involved in flavonoid biosynthesis in plants and melanin in bacteria. Genes whose sequences are similar to type I PKSs were first identified using PCR in several species of dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Snyder et al., 2003)</ref> including K. brevis, the major producer of brevetoxin <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Snyder et al., 2005)</ref> and Amphidinium sp., which produces amphidinolides, a group of cytotoxins <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kubota et al., 2006)</ref>. Screening of cDNA libraries then revealed that the PKS sequences in K. brevis are similar to modular type I PKSs, but the organization of the genes resembles Type II, i.e. each functional 'domain' occurs and is expressed as a separate protein ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 8C</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Monroe and Van Dolah, 2008)</ref>. Using antibodies raised against peptides identified from deduced amino acid sequences of PKS in K. brevis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Monroe et al. (2010)</ref> found that, although transcript abundance was similar between the toxic and non-toxic substrain of K. brevis, protein abundance in the non-toxic substrain was 50e75% lower than the other. Furthermore, these authors found that these proteins were localized in chloroplast. If further verified, this intracellular distribution is consistent with that of another polyketide toxin, okadaic acid, in Prorocentrum lima and P. maculosum <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Zhou and Fritz, 1994)</ref>. This is interesting, particularly because the Prorocentrum spp. possesses peridinin plastids, whereas K. brevis possesses a haptophyte-type plastid. PKS genes from P. lima should be coded in the nuclear genome because the peridinin plastid only contains about 16 plastid genes, all related to photosynthesis. Presumably, PKS genes in K. brevis are also nuclear-encoded because their transcripts are are SL transspliced <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Monroe and Van Dolah, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="15.">The non-photosynthetic pathway of photoenergy utilization via proton-pump rhodopsin</head><p>The notion that biological conversion of solar energy to the bioavailable form ATP is solely through photosynthesis was first challenged by the discovery four decades ago of the bacteriorhodopsin (BR), which contains all-trans retinal as a chromophore, in a haloarchaea <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius, 1971)</ref>. Since then, several variants of BR and other related retinal proteins capable of light-induced chloride transport (halorhodopsin) and control of cell motility (sensory rhodopsin I and II) have been discovered in Archaea (for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Lanyi and Balashov, 2008)</ref>. It was long held that retinal-based energy conversion is restricted to archaea in extreme conditions of high light and high salt. The discovery of a gene homologous to BR from uncultured marine proteobacteria in the Pacific Ocean <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Béjà et al., 2000)</ref> changed this view. Expression of this gene in E. coli produced the retinal protein proteorhodopsin (PR), which facilitates transmembrane proton transport leading to energy production. Numerous PR genes have since been found in different aquatic environments (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Béjà et al., 2001)</ref>. Moreover, retinal proteins with homology to BR and bearing all-trans retinal as a chromophore (type 1 retinal proteins) have subsequently been discovered in fungi and algae. Some of these proteins are apparently proton pumps, as in Leptosphaeria <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Waschuk et al., 2005)</ref>, while others are sensors, as in Chlamydomonas <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Foster et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Sineshchekov et al., 2002)</ref>. Now, transcripts of this gene have been identified from several dinoflagellates grown in the laboratory, including the ancestral and heterotrophic species O. marina, later-diverging peridinin-plastid species Polarella antartica, Pyrocystis lunulla, A. catenella and K. veneficum, as well as a natural dinoflagellate assemblage in Long Island Sound <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Okamoto and Hastings, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Slamovits et al., 2011)</ref>. These results suggest that rhodopsin genes are ubiquitous in dinoflagellates. Further, phylogenetic analysis indicates that dinoflagellate rhodopsin is most closely related to xanthorhodopsin, a unique rhodopsin that contains a carotenoid molecule as well as retinal in the light-harvesting antenna . The dinoflagellate rhodopsin possesses all major amino acid residues conserved for ion-type rhodopsin, particularly the residue that is critical for proton flux generation <ref type="figure">(Fig. 9)</ref>. Despite the diverse functions possibly possessed by this gene, rhodopsin in dinoflagellates may enable these organisms to harvest and convert solar energy to ATP. This is the first detection of protonpump rhodopsin in eukaryotes. Further molecular and biochemical examination to determine the composition of the chromophore and the function of dinoflagellate rhodopsin is warranted. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>.

Future directions: genome-wide transcriptome and genome sequencing Due to their immense sizes, no dinoflagellate genomes have been sequenced. Information on genomic structure has mainly derived from analyses of genomic sequences of individual genes. Coding sequences have largely come from cDNA and EST analyses. Luciferin-binding protein, luciferase, Rubisco, polyketide synthase, chlorophyll-binding protein, heat shock protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, tubulin and actin are among those that have been investigated. A recent study examined genomic context of H. triquetra <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(McEwan et al., 2008)</ref>, and found gene density comparable to that predicted by the regression model <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Lin and Hou, 2009)</ref>. With rapid advances in sequencing technology, the volume of EST (transcriptomic) data has grown quickly and can now expand to genome-wide transcriptome with affordable cost. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has just launched an initiative to sequence 750 eukaryotic microbe transcriptomes, including some dinoflagellates. This effort is likely to provide a quantum leap in our understanding and research strategies within the next year, during which we will move from individual laboratories collecting ESTs to publicly available deep transcriptome sequences for comparative analysis. Whole-genome sequencing of dinoflagellates is also on the horizon. The real challenge will lie in bioinformatic analysis to assemble sequenced bits to genes or chromosomes. This is particularly difficult because <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Similarity of dinoflagellate rhodopsin to proton pump rhodopsin in bacteria.

From , with permission of the National Academy of Sciences, USA. dinoflagellate genomes are highly redundant, with numerous highly similar sequences. In addition, the high number of repetitive non-coding regions, as demonstrated in small-scale analysis for H. triquetra <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(McEwan and Keeling, 2008)</ref>, will pose challenges for both sequencing and assembly. As secondgeneration sequencing platforms are improving their read lengths (e.g. 454 GSFLX titanium promising 1 kb read length) and third-generation sequencing technology (e.g. singlemolecule sequencing promising &gt;10 kb read length) is emerging, challenges will soon subside to some extent. In addition, continued improvement of biocomputing will hopefully further address the assembly issue. Initial effort is under way in several laboratories to sequence some dinoflagellate genomes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Two major morphotypes and the phylogenetic position of the dinoflagellate phylum.

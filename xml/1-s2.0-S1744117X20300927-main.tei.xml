<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The unprecedented access to annotated genomes now facilitates the investigation of the molecular basis of epigenetic phenomena in phenotypically diverse animals. In this critical review, we describe the roles of molecular epigenetic mechanisms in regulating mitotically and meiotically stable spatiotemporal gene expression, phenomena that provide the molecular foundation for the intra-, inter-, and trans-generational emergence of physiological phenotypes. By focusing principally on emerging comparative epigenetic roles of DNA-level and transcriptome-level epigenetic mark dynamics in the emergence of phenotypes, we highlight the relationship between evolutionary conservation and innovation of specific epigenetic pathways, and their interplay as a priority for future study. This comparative approach is expected to significantly advance our understanding of epigenetic phenomena, as animals show a diverse array of strategies to epigenetically modify physiological responses. Additionally, we review recent technological advances in the field of molecular epigenetics (singlecell epigenomics and transcriptomics and editing of epigenetic marks) in order to (1) investigate environmental and endogenous factor dependent epigenetic mark dynamics in an integrative manner; (2) functionally test the contribution of specific epigenetic marks for animal phenotypes via genome and transcript-editing tools. Finally, we describe advantages and limitations of emerging animal models, which under the Krogh principle, may be particularly useful in the advancement of comparative epigenomics and its potential translational applications in animal science, ecotoxicology, ecophysiology, climate change science and wild-life conservation, as well as organismal health.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Epigenetics and animal physiology: a brief primer</head><p>Epigenetics research has transformed conceptual and methodological approaches in all fields of biology, including comparative physiology. Because of the contextually divergent historical use of the term "epigenetics" <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Burggren and Crews, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">Nicoglou and Merlin, 2017)</ref>, the definition of what encompasses epigenetics has been the subject of some debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Deans and Maggert, 2015)</ref>. In the field of comparative physiology, the current conceptual focus of epigenetics includes emergent properties of phenotypic plasticity including phenotypic intra-and inter-individual variation in response to environmental and endogenous cues across an organism's ontogenesis, life-cycle, and its descendants <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Burggren and Crews, 2014)</ref>, with potential significance for evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Crews and Gore, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Guerrero-Bosagna, 2017)</ref>. Several molecular epigenetic mechanisms have been the focus of investigation in this dynamic field ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) and encompass both DNA-level transcriptional control (histone modifications and chromatin structure and DNA methylation) as well as post-transcriptional mechanisms (small and long non-coding RNAs including miRNAs and piwi-interacting RNAs, as well as RNA methylation, more recently referred to as the epi-transcriptome) <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Li et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Peer et al., 2019)</ref>. Together, these mechanisms regulate spatiotemporal gene expression and shape subsequent function independently of changes in the nucleotide sequences (mutations). Molecular epigenetic marks are mitotically and meiotically stable and therefore play important roles in manifestation of physiological phenotypes across ontogeny (e.g. somatic cell differentiation), and across generations by acting on germ cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">(Wu and Sun, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Hanson and Skinner, 2016)</ref>. With the unprecedented and continuously growing availability of genome sequences and annotations across the animal kingdom, the emerging field of comparative epigenetics has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of how molecular epigenetic mechanisms act within different genomic contexts to shape diverse physiological phenotypes within and between generations of different species.</p><p>In this critical review, we define a theoretical and technical experimental framework for future comparative investigation of epigenetics to study animal physiology, and highlight important knowledge gaps and questions as focal points for future research. We also highlight novel original research which rigorously investigates intra-generational epigenetic phenomena at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. In addition to its study in basic physiological sciences, a role for epigenetics in shaping phenotypes is increasingly acknowledged in the applied context of a variety of economically important domesticated terrestrial animals and aquaculture species <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Gavery and Roberts, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">Thompson et al., 2020)</ref>. This is reflected by original research contributions to this special issue which explore the role of brain areaspecific DNA methylation patterns in naturally emerging behavioral variation in Brown Nick Hens <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Guerrero-Bosagna et al., 2020)</ref>, the role of miRNA networks in the regulation of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatic energy metabolism in response to social and nutritional challenges <ref type="bibr">(Kostyniuk and Mennigen, personal communication)</ref>, and the role of exosome miRNAs in the stress response of the same species <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Cadonic et al., 2020)</ref>. The comparative epigenetic framework has also increasingly spurred research applicable to ecotoxicology. This is exemplified by a study in which zebrafish were exposed to the aquatic pharmaceutical pollutant venlafaxine under different temperature regimes, revealing how both anthropogenic and naturogenic influences interact to affect a molecular epigenetic mechanism in the zebrafish ovary <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Ikert and Craig, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Our goal is that this critical review and special issue will serve as a call to further advance research into the role of epigenetic regulation and function in diverse animal physiological phenotypes through an integrative comparative approach. Here we point out that epigenetic mechanisms act upstream of gene expression, and epigenetic marks do not necessarily lead to phenotypic change. Thus, assessing responses over several levels of biological organization is critical for characterizing phenotype. The review is organized by first introducing specific mechanisms of epigenetic change, followed by examples from different animal taxa highlighting the mechanism under discussion. This is followed by specific challenges and opportunities for scientific advance in comparative epigenetics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">DNA level epigenetic transcriptional regulation</head><p>DNA level epigenetic transcriptional regulation involves mechanisms that regulate gene transcription through direct modification of nucleotides or histone proteins, which act to compartmentalize certain regions of the DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bártová et al., 2008)</ref>. Histone proteins package eukaryotic genomes as euchromatin or heterochromatin, broadly defining DNA regions that are active or suppressed in transcriptional activity. Conversely, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to cytosines, rendering promoters and genes themselves inaccessible for the transcriptional machinery <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Doerfler, 1983)</ref>. A class of enzymes (e.g. methyltransferases, acetyltransferases) act to add and remove functional groups to DNA nucleotides or histone proteins, orchestrating fine-tuned control over the timing and patterns of gene expression. This control underlies fundamental biological processes such as development, reproduction, metabolism, and other aspects of physiology and behavior. Most important perhaps is that such modifications can be transferred to subsequent generations potentially preparing offspring for uncertain or harsh environments. However, these transcriptional modifications can also be "reprogrammed" due to anthropogenic (e.g. chemical) and abiotic (e.g. temperature, hypoxia) environmental stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Dorts et al., 2016)</ref>. It is clear that DNA level epigenetic transcriptional regulation is a crucial phenomenon in understanding physiological acclimation/acclimatization and, potentially adaptation, that warrants scientific investigation in comparative animal models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Histone modification and chromatin structure</head><p>Histones are proteins that effectively wind and compartmentalize DNA by forming a series of interacting dimers in the nucleosome. They contain N and C-terminal regions or "histone tails" which are modified by phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, methylation, acetylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(He and Lehming, 2003)</ref>, and other modifiers that are not yet well characterized. The binding and packaging of the DNA is modulated by histone tails modification, which at the end determines DNA accessibility and activation/deactivation of transcription in a time dependent fashion. The two most prevalent classes of enzymes involved in histone modifications are histone acetyltransferase (HATs) and histone deacetylase (HDACs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">(Nakao, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Hayakawa and Nakayama, 2011)</ref>. HATs (now referred to as lysine acetyltransferases (KATs)) add acetyl groups to histone tails, whereas HDACs remove acetyl groups from histone tails. This is achieved using acetyl-coA as a donor to yield acetylated proteins. Once acetylated, euchromatin becomes accessible and transcription can occur. The use of HDAC inhibitors is used as a tool to maintain transcriptionally active chromatin regions. Multiple proteins/protein families have been demonstrated to mediate histone modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(Rando, 2012)</ref>, such as CREB-binding protein, and E1A Binding Protein P300 (EP300) for histone acetyltransferase; histone deacetylase 4, histone deacetylase 6, and histone deacetylase 8 for histone deacetylation; Enhancer of zeste homolog 2, (Euchromatic Histone Lysine Methyltransferase 1), and Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A for histone methylation to name but a few.</p><p>We know comparatively little in non-traditional animal models regarding the dynamic organization of the nucleosome core and associated linker regions, an area of study that is needed to improve our understanding of the timing of DNA transcription. Currently the state of the science in comparative animal physiology is at the point where the community is beginning to identify and quantify the expression patterns of these enzymes in various non-rodent/human animal models. For example, a recent study in the mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) revealed a number of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) genes and predicted the structure of KATs to determine conserved domain organization of their sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Fellous et al., 2019)</ref>. Moreover, in the study, sequence data from chicken, frog, zebrafish, pufferfish and other teleost fishes were used to generate a phylogenetic analysis of rivulus KAT proteins. This study also included real-time PCR analysis of the relative mRNA levels and expression patterns of the different enzymes in early developmental L. <ref type="bibr">Navarro-Martín, et al. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology -Part D 36 (2020) 100745</ref> stages as well as adult tissues. The authors concluded that there was a dynamic pattern of expression during development, with some of the HDAC genes not expressed, while others showing peak expression during organogenesis. Studies such as these will be extremely useful moving forward in comparative animal studies.</p><p>With such an array of diverse enzymes, it is no surprise that there can be variability in the dynamics of these DNA-level epigenetic modifications. For example, it was discovered early-on that histone content could significantly differ, not only across developmental stages in animals, but also across closely related species <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Holmgren et al., 1976)</ref>. This suggested that these epigenetic factors could underlie the concept of the term "species" and could facilitate adaptation and the evolutionary process. In addition, histones and related enzymes have a unique evolutionary history, as revealed by phylogenetic analyses into the evolution of HDACs which appear to involve horizontal gene transfer between prokaryotes and eukaryotes and gene replacement/gene loss in different invertebrate and vertebrate lineages. Even within a species, pronounced differences in histone modification can exist between the sexes. For example, differences in histone modifications (e.g. H3K4me3, H3K27me3) between genetically identical Daphnia pulex males and females are significantly associated with the mean expression of many genes and can affect processes related to collagen biosynthesis, neural system development, muscle contractions, ion homeostasis, platelet homeostasis, metabolism of lipids, and other diverse biological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Kvist et al., 2020)</ref>. This type of diversity at the species level ensures the capacity to exploit new habitats and offers flexibility in the regulation of gene expression.</p><p>In animal physiology, there is an intense and new focus on the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation including histones. These studies have generated novel insight into physiological adaptation and may ultimately explain many animal behaviors. Seebacher and Simmonds (2019) determined whether class I and 2 HDAC activity mediated plasticity of thermal tolerance in zebrafish (Danio rerio). The study revealed that HDAC modification increased muscle activity in cold acclimated fish, but not warm acclimated fish. The study revealed that altering HDAC activity through chemical inhibition resulted in the modification of a number of traits associated with thermal acclimation, yielding new insight into the regulatory mechanisms for thermal plasticity.</p><p>Noteworthy is that these physiological adaptations can result in the evolution of complex behaviors as demonstrated through studies in insects, fish, and birds. Locusts undergo a process called phase transitioning (i.e. locust phase polyphenism), and there can be significant activity in epigenetic regulators, including histone modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Ernst et al., 2015)</ref>. In the study, it was uncovered that histone H3 contained sites that were phosphorylated and unique lysine sites were acetylated, and these modifications were proposed to underlie differences in gregarious versus solitary locus behavior. Thus, epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modification, are clearly involved in this complex phenotypic phenomenon. In a study in zebrafish, Roman and colleagues determined that individual variability in swimming behavior is correlated to histone H4 acetylation levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Román et al., 2018)</ref>. This molecular mechanism may explain, in part, behavioral differences in zebrafish strains from different laboratories, supporting the hypothesis that epigenetic regulation is a potentially significant contributing factor to biological variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Burggren and Crews, 2014)</ref>. Fish activity (i.e. speed and circularity, distance traveled) was assessed and HDAC activity and gene expression was linked to behavioral responses. As pointed out above, H4 histones have a rich evolutionary history involving horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication events across species. This diversity in H4 or any of the other histone families, may constitute a significant determinant of animal adaptation and behavior. In a final example, it was shown that histone H3 acetylation was correlated to restricted feeding time in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Mishra et al., 2020)</ref>. The study revealed that a number of genes involved in epigenetic modifications, such as HDACs and others, were correlated to feeding regimes, and these expression patterns were specific to the tissue examined in many cases (i.e. hypothalamus, liver and gonad-specific patterns). Thus, this study provides evidence that a change in food availability involves a significant response in histone modification enzymes in some bird species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">DNA methylation</head><p>While several forms of DNA methylation exist, 5-cytosine modification are the most studied in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Kumar et al., 2018)</ref>. Both molecular writing, reading and erasing components have been characterized, largely in mammals. Briefly, DMNT methylases (DNMTs) catalyze the addition of a methyl group (CH 3 ) to cytosines, which at least in mammals, occurs within CpG islands <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Deaton and Bird, 2011)</ref>. However, in a comparative context, it is important to keep in mind that the detection of these islands generally occurs through algorithms based on a mammalian genome context, and differences in overall genome methylation frequency, immediate nucleotide sequence context and location in functional genomic elements have been reported between animal species <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">(Sharif et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aliaga et al., 2019)</ref>. DNMTs are historically divided into maintenance and de novo DNMTs in line with their role in maintaining or adding to specific cellular DNA methylation patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">(Robertson and A. Jones, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Cheng, 2014)</ref>, although this distinction is not always as clear-cut in some cellular contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Arand et al., 2012)</ref>. Methyl CpG-binding proteins have been characterized as key readers of methylation marks, and act to recruit further protein components involved in (epigenetic) gene regulation to specific methylated sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Bogdanović and Veenstra, 2009)</ref>. Generally described as inhibitory epigenetic mark in promotor and first intron regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anastasiadi et al., 2018)</ref>, DNA methylation may context-dependently also act to stimulate gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ambrosi et al., 2017)</ref>. Finally, ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET enzymes), enzymes from the AID/APOBEC family members and UDG family of base excision repair (BER) glycosylases have been described to act as erasers, conferring a second aspect of dynamic regulation to DNA methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bhutani et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Xu and Wong, 2015)</ref>. In addition to these enzyme mediated DNA methylation dynamics, passive loss of DNA methylation marks can occur in cell division <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">(Wu and Zhang, 2010)</ref>. Importantly, intermediate products of demethylation processes are recognized to hold functional roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">(Song and He, 2013)</ref>, such as stem cell pluripotency maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">(Shi et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>More recently emerging patterns based on comparative analysis of DNMT loci and DNA methylation is beginning to establish a complex picture in animal evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(de Mendoza et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020)</ref>. In spite of previously reported coincident genomic absence of DNMT loci and cytosine DNA methylation reported in species such as C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">(Yi, 2012)</ref>, a recent comprehensive comparative review concludes that the presence, absence, or diverse combinations of DNMTs in a given genome are poor predictors of genomic 5mC patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(de Mendoza et al., 2019)</ref>. This suggests that either unidentified DNA methylation pathways or a comparatively higher importance for active and passive demethylation pathways exists in animal species, which warrants further investigation. Deeper comparative epigenomic studies have recently allowed to reveal that structure and function of the core methylation enzymes is highly conserved in plants, fungi and animals, but that the nature of how the DNA methylation machinery regulates methylation patterns to establish locus-and cell-specific DNA methylation patterns is often divergent <ref type="bibr" target="#b262">(Zhong, 2016)</ref>. With regard to evolutionary history of readers and erasers, evidence suggests a deep conservation of methyl CpG binding proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Hendrich and Tweedie, 2003)</ref> and TETs in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Iyer et al., 2014)</ref>, however with variable loci and forms, suggesting widespread differences in the molecular toolbox governing functional DNA methylation dynamics. Indeed, future studies will need to functionally link lineage and speciesspecific gene quantity and sequence variability of DNA methylation as well as other epigenetic machinery components to functional dynamics in different species to solidify the mechanistic foundation of comparative epigenetic studies.</p><p>Global cytosine DNA methylation levels and the involvement of DNA methylation during genome imprinting and developmental reprogramming have been found to be highly variable among different mammalian and non-mammalian species, as reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Head (2014)</ref>. In vertebrates, global DNA methylation levels may reach higher percentages levels generally observed in fish and frogs when compared to other vertebrates such as mammals or birds, whereas reptilian DNA exhibits larger variability in global methylation range, encompassing high levels comparable to fish and low levels comparable to mammals. In the case of invertebrates, highly variable global methylation levels are observed, as exemplified by two different insect species: While the flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) has no detectable DNA methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">(Zemach et al., 2010)</ref>, the moth (Mamestra brassicae) has high total DNA methylation levels which are comparable to levels found in vertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Mandrioli and Volpi, 2003)</ref>. To date, dynamics of DNA methylation remain predominantly described in mammalian model species, where somatic cells and germ cells reveal different dynamics. While differentiated somatic cells exhibit highly tissue-specific methylation patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">(McGaughey et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Suelves et al., 2016)</ref>, recent evidence suggests that these tissue patterns are not universal across species, as brain and liver methylomes from zebrafish and mouse tissues clustered together based on species rather than tissue identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">(Zhang, 2018)</ref>. However, it appears that species and/or tissue specific promotor cytosine DNA methylation patterns in primates only modestly translate into species and-tissue specific gene expression profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Blake et al., 2020)</ref>, suggesting other (epigenetic) factors contribute to gene expression differences in between primate species and tissues. Here we point out that some caution should be taken when studying epigenetics in comparative animal studies, as epigenetic marks are cell type-specific and many studies compare tissues (or even whole organisms) that are composed by many different cell-types. This in turn can confound comparative interpretation. To address this, future comparative studies should prioritize the use of single-cell epigenomics when possible; however, the difficulty in conducting such elaborate single cell type experiments in situ is a significant challenge but one we must continue to discuss in animal physiology.</p><p>Functionally, DNA methylation dynamics have been characterized developmentally and also constitute a part of organismal responses to many environmental factors. An interesting example on how environmental cues can modulate phenotypes through epigenetics can be found in honey bees, where it was demonstrated that nutritional differences were responsible for modulating the development of queen and worker bees in genetically identical individuals, via DNA methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Kucharski et al., 2008)</ref>.A detailed description and discussion of how specific environmental factors affect molecular epigenetic marks within and across generations in teleost fish can be found in a recent review <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Best et al., 2018)</ref>. Within a comparative physiological context, pioneering targeted gene-promotor specific DNA methylation studies have been particularly fruitful, and provided unique insight into epigenetic transduction of environmental signals to shape animal physiology. Specifically, changes in promoter DNA methylation of a key enzyme involved in sexual differentiation, gonadal aromatase (cyp19a1a), was found to be the cause for temperature-induced shifts in the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">(Navarro-Martín et al., 2011)</ref>. Additional comparative studies have demonstrated that the same occur in many other fish species, providing evidence for a wider applicability of this mechanism, as temperature dependent aromatase promotor methylation has subsequently also been described in reptiles with temperaturedependent sex determination (TSD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(Parrott et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Matsumoto et al., 2016)</ref>. Together these comparative studies are indicative of a common epigenetic mechanism across different vertebrate groups. Epigenetics can also play an important role in the adaptation to climate change. DNA methylation is involved in climate resilience to harsh environments in livestock animals that, in the past, were forced to rapidly adapt to extreme climatic conditions. An example can be found in Bos Taurus, where methylomes from different breeds of modern tropical creole cattle from Colombia were compared to their putative Iberian ancestors from Spain <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(Sevane et al., 2018)</ref>. Results showed that methylation differences were observed between breeds in genes related to immune response, nervous system, energy management, heat resistance and skin and coat attributes. The authors conclude that physiologically challenging environments have an impact on methylomes regulating key genes involved in pathways related to adaptation. The addition of further studies using species from divergent taxa will be critical for filling in the gaps on how epigenetic regulatory mechanisms can drive evolutionary change.</p><p>DNA methylation in germ cells exhibits dynamic erasure and reestablishment phases in embryonic and adult development. In mammals in which primordial germ cells (PGCs) are derived from somatic precursors in the embryo by instructive signals, a biphasic demethylation occurs to erase already developmentally established epigenetic marks reflective of the somatic origin of PGCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Messerschmidt et al., 2014)</ref>. This erasure is achieved firstly by passive loss during PGC migration (Phase 1), and secondly via active demethylation (Phase 2) and enables the maintenance of a pluripotent state prior to sex-specific differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Messerschmidt et al., 2014)</ref>. The timing of re-methylation dynamics is sex-specific, with prenatal completion of remethylation male germ cells, and postnatal completion in females. Finally, in developing embryos, a second wave of demethylation occurs to trigger the zygotal developmental program <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Messerschmidt et al., 2014)</ref>. Conversely, in zebrafish, an organism in which PGCs are transmitted intergenerationally in the form of inherent germplasm in the oocyte, different germ cell methylation dynamics have been reported characterized by inheritance of a paternal methylation pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(Ortega-Recalde et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Skvortsova et al., 2019)</ref>, which is also observed in early embryonic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Jiang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Potok et al., 2013)</ref>, providing evidence that mammalian-like epigenetic reprogramming patterns might not occur in this species. However, a recent perspective paper from <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">Wang and Bhandari (2020b)</ref> has pointed out that a previous study shown that DNA demethylation patterns during early zebrafish development resemble mammalian-like reprogramming <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Mhanni and McGowan, 2004)</ref>, and suggest to use high-resolution epigenetic profiling to clarify this discrepancy. Nevertheless, this pattern is not representative of all fish species, as recent analyses of primordial germ cell methylation dynamics and early embryonic development dynamics in Japanese medaka exhibit patterns similar to DNA methylation dynamics described in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">(Wang and Bhandari, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b229">, 2020a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b230">, 2020b</ref>. Together this evidence suggests that transgenerational DNA methylation dynamics do not depend on the somatic or maternal germplasm origin of germ cells, and suggests that even within specific vertebrate groups, differential roles for DNA methylation in transgenerational inheritance exist. This has important implications in the interpretation in the role of DNA methylation in transgenerational inheritance, and additional comparative studies investigating germ cell and early embryonic developmental DNA methylation dynamics are clearly warranted.</p><p>With regard to technological advances in the field <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, we anticipate that in addition to increasing genome availabilities, single cells sequencing approaches will likely improve our comparative understanding of molecular DNA methylation dynamics, which will provide important insights into species-specific tissue differentiation dynamics and germ-cell based transmission of DNA methylation. Furthermore, emerging functional modulation of specific DNA methylation marks by CRISPR/dCas9 holds great potential to link specific DNA methylation marks to animal phenotypes, thus move from correlative to functional approaches.</p></div>

Small-noncoding RNAs: microRNAs</head><p>MicroRNAs are a class of short (22 nt) non-coding RNA molecules, which are transcribed into pre-miRNA molecules and processed into their mature form in the cytoplasm principally via a well characterized and conserved canonical pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(He and Hannon, 2004)</ref>. In addition to the canonical pathway, specific miRNA can be generated via noncanonical pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">(O'Brien et al., 2018)</ref>. Noncanonically processed miRNAs may be encoded within introns of host genes processed via RNA splicing and act to support host-gene function <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Najafi-Shoushtari et al., 2010)</ref>. Irrespective of the biogenesis pathway, miRNAs in the cytoplasm exert their function by recruiting Argonaute RISC Catalytic Component 2 (Ago2) proteins to recognized target mRNAs, principally via complimentary sequence-specific interaction with the 3'UTR part of the mRNAs (McGeary et al., 2019). Ago2 is a key part of the RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), which acts to degrade mRNAs and block their translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bazzini et al., 2012</ref>). Because of their small size and the key role of nt 1-8 as extended seed region in identifying posttranscriptional regulated targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(McGeary et al., 2019)</ref>, miRNAs are promiscuous and can act on many targets simultaneously, potentially acting as key nodes of in transcriptional networks. Indeed, while key miRNA switches for biological processes do exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Maniyadath et al., 2019)</ref>, the difficulty lies in the identification of physiologically relevant interactions in the sea of miRNA-targeted transcripts. While miRNA biogenesis and miRNA's posttranscriptional mode of action have been well characterized, miRNA turnover is currently much less understood. Nevertheless, miRNA turnover is likely an important contributor to miRNAs biological function as indicated by largely different half-lives of specific miRNAs established in pulse-chase experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Marzi et al., 2016)</ref>. Intriguingly, miRNAs do not only act within individual cells, since they can be exported via the exosomal pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Castaño et al., 2018)</ref> or even as vesicle-free miRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Park, 2017)</ref>. Therefore, it has been suggested that miRNAs may function as hormones, since they can be secreted from neuroendocrine cells, transferred to the blood stream, and regulate gene transcription in target cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Park, 2017)</ref>. With few exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Cadonic et al., 2020)</ref>, circulating miRNAs remain largely unstudied in comparative model organisms. Outside the individual organism, a few studies have raised the possibility of a role for nutritionally acquired stable plant miRNAs to functionally affect the consumer's hepatic gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b257">(Zhang et al., 2012)</ref>, raising the possibility of potential trans-kingdom communication. However, this possibility remains under debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">(Wang et al., 2018b)</ref>. In terms of function in a comparative physiology context, several points merit attention. First, there is a well-described evolution of miRNAs families, which initially led to the observation that miRNA number encoded in a genome is linked to organismal complexity and that miRNAs should therefore be considered as markers of molecular phylogenetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">(Wheeler et al., 2009)</ref>. While it has since been demonstrated that miRNA families not only diversify, but also disappear in specific lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Hertel and Stadler, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Tarver et al., 2018)</ref>, the fact remains that miRNAs can be both deeply conserved and highly species-or lineage-specific, suggesting important contributions to organismal physiology in a comparative context. Some miRNAs in animals, such as the deeply conserved, muscle-specific miRNA-1/133 and vertebrate and liver specific miRNA-122 are highly abundant and expressed in specific tissues, with relatively well defined and conserved roles in tissue development and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Mishima et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Tsai et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Laudadio et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Mennigen et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Second, miRNA-target networks, which can be experimentally validated at the genome scale via RIP-chip assays or miRNA mimics and inhibitors <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, remain poorly characterized in a comparative context <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">(Mennigen, 2016)</ref>. Indeed, even within vertebrates, miRNAtarget gene relationships are estimated to be conserved relatively poorly, with an estimated 10% of deeply conserved miRNA-target relationships between fish and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">(Xu et al., 2013)</ref>. Recent comparative description of the miRNA repertoire and predicted miRNA targets in one of the most species-rich vertebrate families, the cichlids <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">(Xiong et al., 2018)</ref>, further emphasize a potential role of miRNA-target network rewiring in the evolution of (physiological) phenotypes. Such an evolutionary role for miRNAs is furthermore supported by a recent comprehensive in silico study revealing divergent selection pressure on specific miRNA target sites in vertebrate evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">(Simkin et al., 2020)</ref>. Therefore, miRNA biology in a comparative context holds potential to uncover not only deeply conserved miRNA-target relationships, but also to identify species-specific posttranscriptional regulation and their role in specific (physiological) phenotypes. This also includes the comparative exploration of uncovered unconventional miRNA function, such as for example the regulation of mitochondrial transcripts through mitochondrial miRNAs (MitomiRs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Dragomir et al., 2018a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Dragomir et al., , 2018b</ref>.</p><p>Outside an organism's life-span, emerging evidence in mammals suggest that germ cell miRNAs may be important contributors to intergenerational (parent to offspring) inheritance of several phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">(Trigg et al., 2019)</ref>, including, but not limited to, stress-responsiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">(Rodgers et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Dickson et al., 2018)</ref> and obesity and metabolic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Grandjean et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Fullston et al., 2016)</ref>. While these findings are largely based on paternal contributions via sperm, comparative physiology offers the possibility to explore regulation of oocyte miRNA and potential function in externally fertilizing widely used model species, such as zebrafish. Indeed, in a recent study, developmental exposure to the pharmaceutical pollutant fluoxetine altered specific miRNA content in unfertilized eggs (Martinez et al., 2019), which could be linked to the intergenerational transmission of a low cortisol phenotype in response to developmental exposures to fluoxetine in this species <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">(Vera-Chang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Martinez et al., 2019)</ref>. Microinjection studies modulating specific egg miRNAs prior to in vitro fertilization can establish whether such changes are indeed functionally linked.</p></div>

Transcribed from evolutionary diverse, intergenic clusters containing many defective transposons, mature piRNAs are processed from single stranded piRNA precursors by a suite of factors contained in compartments adjacent to mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Czech and Hannon, 2016)</ref>. Mature piRNAs interact with PIWI family proteins, a largely gonad and germ-line expressed subclade of the Argonaute protein family. Piwi proteins were named after the first characterized member in the fruitfly termed (P-element-induced wimpy testes), found to be essential for germline development <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Cox et al., 2019)</ref>. In addition to Piwi, which is also expressed in somatic tissue and can shuttle to the nucleus, germ-line specific Aubergine (Aub) and Argonaut 3 (Ago3) were also characterized in the fruitfly model as members of piRNA interacting proteins and found to be equally necessary for male and/or female germ cell development <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Schmidt et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Li et al., 2009)</ref>. Functionally, like miRNAs, piRNAs act in an RNA-induced silencing complex, which in the case of piRNAs is termed piRISC. In contrast to miRNAs targeting mRNA transcripts, the principal piRNA targets are transcribed transposons, which piRNAs can degrade post-transcriptionally via PIWI protein family members' slicer activity in the cytoplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(Vagin et al., 2004)</ref>. Additionally, piRNAs have been shown to stage-specifically silence transposons at the DNA level during gametogenesis.

While the reproductive roles of piRNAs have been largely studied especially in fruitfly and mouse models <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">(Russell and LaMarre, 2018)</ref>, additional studies in comparative models have recently uncovered somatic roles for piRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Ponnusamy et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Rojas-Ríos and Simonelig, 2018)</ref>. This is exemplified by studies investigating roles of piRNAs in the central nervous system. In the California seahare (Aplysia californica), for example, piRNAs promote long-term synaptic plasticity and memory enhancement by facilitating serotonin-mediated suppression of CREB2 via promotor methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">(Rajasethupathy et al., 2012)</ref>. Recently, piRNAs have also been identified in the hippocampus of mice, where they interact with the PIWI protein family member MIWI to regulate dendritic spine development and morphogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Lee et al., 2011)</ref>. Recent comparative studies have also implicated piRNAs in metabolic processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism. In fat bodies of the fruitfly, defects in nuclear Piwi are associated with depletion of piRNAs, increased transposon mobilization and DNA damage and reduced lipid synthesis and storage. Secondary consequences of this nuclear PIWI/piRNA dependent effect on lipid metabolism are fat-body dependent physiological changes including defects in metabolic homeostasis, immunological defects and a shortened lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Jones et al., 2016)</ref>. Piwi has recently also been shown to play a role in mediating glucose-stimulated insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells, and while a role for specific piRNAs has not been formally proven, the expression of piRNAs DQ732700 and DQ764748 is highly elevated in pancreatic beta cells of the diabetic GK rat model <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Henaoui et al., 2017)</ref>. Nuclear PIWI and piRNAs have also been shown to be involved in adult tissue regeneration and differentiation, as evidenced by the transient upregulation of the cnidarian PIWI family member CNIWI in muscle trans-differentiation in jelly fish (Podocoryne carnea), reported by Seipel and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(Seipel et al., 2004)</ref>. Finally, a female W chromosome encoded piRNA (fempiRNA) has been shown to be involved in sex determination in the silkworm (Bombyx mori) by suppressing a male specific splice variant of the bdmsx gene transcript <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Kiuchi et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Because the piRNA action in reproduction and germ-cells is particularly well established across different animal species, it is not surprising that inter-and transgenerational roles for piRNAs have also begun to emerge. For example, fruitfly maternally deposited piRNAs have been shown to destabilize maternally deposited early embryonic mRNAs with important morphogenic roles, such as nanos and oskar thus directly contributing to early developmental regulation of pole cell development in the offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b248">(Yamashiro and Siomi, 2018)</ref>. In line with the piRNAs described protective role with regard to transposon infiltration of the genome, it has been reported that maternal deposition of initiator piRNAs can prime offspring embryos in the fruitfly to provide a form of innate immunity against hybrid dysgenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Grentzinger et al., 2012)</ref>. This process renders piRNA-naïve females sterile for most of their life, as no innate immunity is present to protect the germ cells in mature offspring ovaries form the paternal transposon activity. Indeed, fertility is only secondarily acquired through adaptive piRNA mediated responses in the germ cells later in life once TE integrate into piRNA clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Czech and Hannon, 2016)</ref>. This mechanism is likely restricted to insects, in which maternal specification of the germ cell line provides direct continuity of germ cells across generations, whereas in amniotes other than birds, in which somatic cells are induced to yield germ cell progenitors in late development, this continuity is not given and germ line reprogramming through resetting of the epigenome requires adaptive rather than innate silencing through piRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(Ozata et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3.">Long non-coding RNAs: lncRNAs</head><p>RNA molecules are diverse, and new transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have recently been discovered. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are RNAs whose length is typically greater than 200 nucleotides. lncRNA have been shown to regulate transcription by interacting with the DNA (both in a cis-and trans-fashion) and by regulating histone modifying complexes. These diverse and generally not deeply conserved lncRNA have been characterized across animal taxa, and studies are now shedding light on their importance in animal physiology. Below we provide some examples that highlight this regulatory diversity.</p><p>Morphological transformations are rooted in complex interactome networks involving different RNA subtypes and families. Amphibians undergo a dramatic transformation from tadpole to adult frog, regulated by several environmental cues and hormones. The American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), like other amphibians, initiates this transformation upon the application of thyroid hormones. In an experiment, bullfrog tadpoles were treated with triiodothyronine (T3) for 48 h; this activated transcriptional networks associated with thyroid hormonemediated restructuring of the back skin during the transition from larval tadpoles to adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Hammond et al., 2017)</ref>. Using transcriptomics, researchers identified genes related to RNA processing functions and cell proliferation as those predominantly activated after T3 exposure. In addition, the authors identified putative lncRNAs that were also linked to the dynamic regulation of the transcriptome with predicted target enrichments for metamorphic transition.</p><p>In addition to amphibian metamorphosis, lncRNA are involved in sex differentiation and reproduction. As demonstrated in the Chinese soft-shell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis), a correlation network revealed that 63 lncRNAs and 185 mRNA were associated with sex differentiation in the turtle based on cis and trans regulation (Zhang et al., 2018). These lncRNAs were linked to a number of well-known sex differentiation genes including dmrt1, gata4, different sox genes and rspo1 among others. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that these genes were related to RNA transport, regulation of the cell skeleton, endocytosis, and gap junctions. The study demonstrated that lncRNAs have an important role in sex differentiation in reptiles, a role that is also reported in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Rastetter et al., 2015)</ref>. Studies in the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) also indicate that lncRNAs are regulated in the gonad following disruptions in hormone systems. For example, insulin growth factor 3 (igf3) knockdown using RNA interference in the common carp results in alterations in, not only the transcriptome, but also a number of lncRNAs, suggesting that hormonal systems are regulated by these epigenetic mechanisms and vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">(Zhang et al., 2018)</ref>. Lastly, recent studies show that perturbations by endocrine disruptors, such as the widely used herbicide atrazine, can disrupt miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA networks in the testes of Xenopus laevis tadpoles <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">(Sai et al., 2019</ref>). An analysis based on the lncRNAs and correlated mRNA expression revealed that genes related to FoxO signaling, WNT signaling, and oocyte meiosis were disrupted in the gonad by atrazine.</p><p>LncRNAs also play a significant role in the inflammatory response and are regulated during pathogenic challenges in animals. This recent discovery is expected to yield an exciting new era of research into innate and adaptive immune systems in animals such as fish <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">(Wang et al., 2018a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b234">(Wang et al., , 2018b</ref>, adding a new layer to the growing complexity of gene expression. An important point to make is that lncRNAs do not only regulate the immune system of vertebrates, but they also play a role in pathological and immunological processes in insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">(Satyavathi et al., 2017)</ref>. It is therefore interesting to note that, while the immune system has greatly diversified over evolutionary time in many aspects, lncRNA remains a shared epigenetic mechanism of regulation in animals. This suggests that this mechanism developed early in the evolutionary tree of life. Researchers challenging Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) with infections of sea lice identified a number of differentially expressed lncRNAs that were closely associated with genes related to the immune response in Atlantic salmon; however, the lncRNAs localized more closely to genes controlling tissue repair responses in the Coho salmon <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">(Valenzuela-Muñoz et al., 2018)</ref>. This suggests that closely related species may have developed different strategies using epigenetic mechanisms to respond to parasite infestation. Comparative studies are needed to explore this possibility further.</p><p>Other environmental stressors have been investigated at the level of lncRNA. Liu and colleagues showed that lncRNAs are involved in the brain's response to hypoxia in yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Liu et al., 2018)</ref>. The study revealed that there were more than 7600 upregulated lncRNAs and more than 7700 down-regulated lncRNAs. Interestingly, more than 15 lncRNAs were associated with Egl-9 Family Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1, with some lncRNAs showing a positive correlation and some lncRNA showing a negative correlation. The authors demonstrated that lncRNA are important in the response to environmentally low levels of oxygen and presented an expression network involving both genes and lncRNA profiles. Yellow croaker is a species of fish that is well adapted to hypoxic environments, and comparative studies in other fish will reveal whether these responses are conserved in animals inhabiting low oxygen environments.</p><p>Stress responses in animal models are also vigorously researched, as acute and chronic stress can affect all aspects of physiology in species reared for aquaculture/food production and those under conservation (zoos and within protected habitats). The red cusk-eel Genypterus chilensis is a species important to aquaculture in the Chilean region, and experiments were conducted to understand stress physiology at the molecular level. Animal were exposed to daily handling stress consisting of netting and chasing the fish for five minutes over five days <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Dettleff et al., 2020)</ref>. The study investigated liver, head kidney, and skeletal muscle responses and revealed differentially expressed transcripts and lncRNAs based on a correlation co-expression network analysis. The authors determined the potential roles of lncRNA in each tissue in response to handling stress and identified more than 8000 lncRNA across the three tissues. Interestingly, each tissue exhibited a unique profile to handling stress and more than 300 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified between control and stress-induced groups. LncRNAs associated with genes related to metabolic processes were affected. It was also revealed that the muscle was quite different from the liver and the head kidney in terms of its transcriptome and lncRNA response and the ubiquitin-proteasome system was implicated in the handling stress along with muscle atrophy. The study demonstrated that tissues have a diverse response in terms of lncRNA expression under the same environmental stress.</p><p>Comparative animal studies clearly demonstrate that lncRNA have diverse roles in sex differentiation, reproduction, immunity, and hormone signaling. Indeed, the comprehensive annotation of the rainbow trout lncRNA repertoire identified immune response, neural processes, and muscle differentiation as key processes under the control of lncRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">(Wang et al., 2016a)</ref>. Comparative animal physiologists are expected to rigorously conduct further studies to elucidate functional roles of these molecules which appear to respond to a wide range of environmental stressors. Further work on lncRNAs will shed additional light onto animal adaptations in the environment.</p></div>

While several forms of RNA methylation exist, the most well-studied is the m 6 A methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Chen and Witte, 2019)</ref>. The m 6 A mark is the most abundant modification (~0.5%) in the majority of eukaryote mRNAs studied to date. The mark, at least in humans, is enriched around stop codons, 3'UTRs and within long internal exons <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Dominissini et al., 2012)</ref>. Establishment of m 6 A marks on pre-mRNA molecules occurs in the nucleus via a writer complex conserved in eukaryotes. This complex consists of two key components, catalytically active methyltransferases 3 and 14 (METTL3, METTL14) dimer, as well as several accessory proteins involved in mRNA targeting <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bokar et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Liu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b231">Wang et al., 2016a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b232">Wang et al., , 2016b</ref>. Conversely, erasers, specifically fat-mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), act to remove m 6 A marks by oxidation in the nucleus but also in the cytosol, rendering this RNA modification a dynamic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Jia et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b261">Zheng et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b236">Wei et al., 2018)</ref>. Unlike core writing complex components, FTO and ALKBH5 are restricted to vertebrates, with additional identification of FTO in two algal species <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Fredriksson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Feng et al., 2014</ref>). Similar to the described DNA methylation pathway components, RNA methylation machinery contains, in addition to enzymes which establish and erase the epigenetic mark, proteins capable of reading the m 6 A methylation signal to mediate molecular and ultimately physiological consequences. These readers include proteins which are capable of directly binding to a m 6 A mark , acting to influence mRNA turnover by affecting splicing, nuclear export, translation and degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(Roundtree et al., 2017)</ref>. While the m6A pathway has been most widely studied in mammalian model systems, the fruitfly has been established as a viable invertebrate system to study phenotypic consequences of m6A methylation as it contains a METTL3 homolog and 5'UTR enriched m A modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Kan et al., 2020)</ref>. This contrasts with nematodes, which appear to lack a core m 6 A machinery involved in RNA, but not DNA m 6 A methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Dezi et al., 2016)</ref>. In terms of phenotypic consequences of m 6 A pathway disruption, several physiological responses have been established, largely in mammalian models, but to some extent in other vertebrate and invertebrate model systems.</p><p>Clear-cut roles for m 6 A have been established in embryonic development and stem cell differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Batista et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Geula et al., 2015)</ref>. Through promoting hematopoietic stem cell differentiation via symmetric commitment, for example, METTL3 dependent m 6 A marks are critically involved in the maintenance of red and white blood cell populations as well as platelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Cheng et al., 2019)</ref>. Not only cell-fatedependent, but also directly regulatory roles of m 6 A marks are involved in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis and the immune system. Regarding metabolic homeostasis for example, FTO-dependent demethylation of m 6 A marks on the adipogenic factor RUNX1T1 transcripts are required for adipogenesis. Both pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and insulin degranulation are dependent on METTL14 in mice, and METTL14 KO mice mimicked a metabolic phenotype similar to human T2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(De Jesus et al., 2019)</ref>. Recent evidence of nutrition- <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">(Wu et al., 2020)</ref> and microbiome-dependent regulation of m 6 A signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Jabs et al., 2020)</ref> are suggestive of the fact that m 6 A RNA methylation is likely an important factor in environmental regulation of metabolic homeostasis. Similarly, the FTO gene, prior to its recognized role as mammalian m 6 A eraser, has been shown to be induced by food restriction in hypothalamic areas controlling feed-intake, suggesting that m 6 A marks likely coordinate organismal metabolic homeostasis by affecting multiple tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Fredriksson et al., 2008)</ref>. With regard to immune responses, METLL3-depednent m6A marks are required for homeostatic expansion of T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Li et al., 2017)</ref>, while m 6 A marks specific to interferon B transcripts accelerate their turnover and facilitate viral propagation <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">(Winkler et al., 2019)</ref>, suggesting involvement in the control of both adaptive and innate components of the mammalian immune system. The central nervous system has emerged as another important target of m 6 A-dependent regulation. Similar to other cell types described previously, self-renewal and differentiation of neural stem cells have been shown to be dependent on m 6 A RNA methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Li et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">Rockwell and Hongay, 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, m 6 A modifications have been implicated in CNS stress responsiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Engel et al., 2018)</ref>, as well as learning and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Leighton et al., 2018)</ref>. Finally, taking advantage of the invertebrate fruitfly model <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Kan et al., 2017)</ref> as well as a viable homozygous METTL3 KO vertebrate models <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">(Xia et al., 2018)</ref>, a role for m 6 A marks in sexual development and reproduction has recently been established. In Drosophila, m A marks are required for proper female-specific Sxl splicing, thus directly contributing to sex determination <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Kan et al., 2017)</ref>. In zebrafish, mettl3 mutation was shown to result in serious defects in sperm and oocyte development, some of which may depend on reduced activity of the HPG axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">(Xia et al., 2018)</ref>. In addition to these intra-generational roles of m 6 A marks, recent evidence also suggests their involvement in interand trans-generational implications. For example, a low fat nutritional regime administered to pregnant fat sand rats (Psammomys obesus), resulted in higher body weight and hyperglycemia which coincided with higher hypothalamic METTL3 and FTO transcript levels and reduced overall RNA m 6 A marks <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Kaspi et al., 2018)</ref>. In brine-shrimp (Artemia franciscana), parental exposure of the plant-based phenolic compound at early life stages induced transgenerational resistance against pathogen infections and thermal stress, accompanied by altered global abundance of m 6 A marks in cysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Roy et al., 2019)</ref>. Given the recent evidence for multiple physiological roles of m6A RNA methylation, future comparative work is anticipated to yield additional insight into how the epi-transcriptome contributes to the adaptive success of many diverse animal phenotypes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Comparative epigenetics: a new frontier</head><p>Comparative epigenetics aims to identify shared conserved epigenetic modifications across animal taxa (i.e. epigenetic conservation of methylation patterns for example in animal tissues), but also to determine epigenetic mechanisms that facilitate unique phenotypic plasticity and adaptation. Currently, both DNA-level transcriptional and RNA-level post-transcriptional acting mechanisms are comparatively studied across different organismal and generational timescales <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Best et al., 2018)</ref>. This endeavor has been augmented by the unprecedented availability of annotated genomic sequences of diverse animal species, accessible through NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/ browse#!/eukaryotes) and Ensembl (https://useast.ensembl.org/ index.html) genome databases. This availability of genome datasets has quickly led to an increased comparative understanding of species-specific adaptations mediated by, for example, nucleotide sequence mutations, exemplified by the divergent metabolic phenotype in cavedwelling and river-dwelling populations of the Cave fish (Mexicanus astans) linked to a point mutation in the insulin receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">(Riddle et al., 2018)</ref>. However, the contribution of epigenetic regulation of these genomes to physiological phenotypes within an organism's life cycle and between generations in response to exogenous and endogenous cues remains a largely unexplored area of investigation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to rendering experimental '-omics' level investigation of molecular epigenetic marks feasible across a much wider range of animal species, an additional advantage of increased available genome sequence availability is the comparative characterization of encoded enzyme repertoires involved in establishing and erasing epigenetic marks in different animal genomes. Indeed, by assessing genome-wide epigenetic marks in relation to available epigenetic enzyme machinery, it has become evident that the relatively small number of traditionally used genome-sequenced animal model organisms is far from representative of the diversity of the molecular epigenetic repertoire in animals. In this context, it is therefore important to consider conserved and lineage-or species-specific aspects of the molecular epigenetic machinery and dynamics <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. For example, major model species, such as Caenorhabditis elegans in which miRNAs were discovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Lee et al., 1993)</ref>, lack cytosine DNA methylation, as does the fruitfly (Drosphila melanogaster) and likely the entire clade of Diptera <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(de Mendoza et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Schmitz et al., 2019)</ref>. Teleost fishes, the largest vertebrate infraclass, have undergone a high degree of diversification including one or more genome duplication events, and expansions of proteins involved in DNA methylation and miRNA biogenesis and turnover have occurred in the context of these teleost genome duplication events. These changes may have initially been necessary to regulate of larger, duplicated genomes, but may subsequently have undergone sub-or neo-functionalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Best et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Liu et al., 2020)</ref>. Recent comparative studies report a lack of correlation between genome cytosine DNA methylation and de novo DNA-methyltransferase encoding loci especially in some insect genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">(Schmitz et al., 2019)</ref>. This suggests the presence of potentially undiscovered pathways governing DNA cytosine methylation dynamics in these species. In contrast to DNA methylation gene family and "miRNA biogenesis" gene family expansions in teleost fishes, the loss of the aforementioned maelstrom (Mael) has been reported in this infraclass <ref type="bibr" target="#b256">(Zhang et al., 2008)</ref>. Mael plays, at least in mice (Mus musculus) and the fruitfly, important roles in germline development <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">(Russell and LaMarre, 2018)</ref>. Interestingly, it has been found that piwi-RNAs are, in spite of the absence of maelstrom, nevertheless functionally involved in zebrafish germ-line development <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Houwing et al., 2007)</ref>, suggesting different piRNA pathway components are involved in this process in zebrafish compared to mammals and fruitfly. Altogether, such findings suggest that comparatively, epigenetic pathways may be plastic in their function and may indeed contain yet undiscovered pathway components in at least some species. Within the context of transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic marks via the germ-line, zebrafish for example are another model species with 'unusual' or non-mammalian epigenetic characteristics, as the paternal methylome is, in stark contrast to mammalian models investigated to date, not erased but rather transmitted to the developing embryo <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Jiang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Potok et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">Ortega-Recalde et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Skvortsova et al., 2019)</ref>.

Nevertheless, unprecedented access to genome sequences will continue, leading to renewed appreciation of the diversity of comparative epigenetic mechanisms underlying phenotypes in animals. It is therefore important to keep in mind that the discussions to follow are based on those epigenetic mechanisms most well-studied and represent a relatively small pool of species investigated thus far. Furthermore, epigenetic programming which occurs over generations can strengthen or weaken over time, and this may be dependent upon the frequency and magnitude of the selection pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Hoppeler, 2015)</ref>. Renewed focus should be given to specific epigenetic modifications that are most likely to be core epigenetic programming for all animals. Identifying key genes regulated by DNA methylation during development in many different species would be key to know which genes drive developmental process epigenetically. The extent to which epigenetic modifiers or epigenetic mechanisms influence the adaptive response may most likely be revealed within the process of convergent evolution. For example, do monophyletic species independently exhibit similar phenotypes in shared environments because the environment induces a specific epigenetic reprogramming in multiple species. Indeed, these phenotypic manifestations can be rooted in behavioral responses to environmental cues as epigenetic reprogramming.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Comparative investigation of evolutionary molecular epigenetic pathway conservation and innovation</head><p>Increased access to genome information, including duplications in genomes, will provide additional insight into epigenetic repertoire and marks. High throughput techniques are expected to elucidate baseline and altered epigenetic marks in different tissues and life-stages with unprecedented detail, for example through single cell sequencing approaches and developmental and/or transgenerational designs. Comparative epigenetic approaches warrant not only adequate knowledge of life-histories and inter-transgenerational modes of action, but also a knowledge of the extent and diversity of molecular epigenetic toolboxes available to specific species. For example, transgenerational inheritance in females is ascertained after three generations in rodent models, whereas externally fertilizing species such as fish only require experimental designs up to the F2 generation to address transgenerational phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Best et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>As discussed in detail, the traditional focus on a few model species has revealed that species studied to-date may not always be representative of the complexity of epigenetic pathways largely identified in mammals, exemplified by the lack of DNA methylation in C. elegans. Even when specific pathways are functional, their specific components may have been lost or diversified, or modes of action of molecular epigenetic mechanisms may differ from the mammalian-centric view. This is exemplified by zebrafish, which have lost the critical piwi-miRNA component Maelstrom yet exhibit piRNA mediated control of germ cell development <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Houwing et al., 2007)</ref>. Additionally, zebrafish contrast mammalian models whose germ cells are of somatic origin and exhibits a diversification of de novo DNA methylase gene repertoire and a lack of developmental periods of de-and re-methylation. Zebrafish furthermore exhibit a unique pattern of transmission of the paternal methylome to the zygote including germ cells. If and how these zebrafish-specific epigenetic molecular pathways are (collectively) involved in these processes remains unknown, as do functional consequences. Such examples illustrate clearly that while general evolutionary patterns of molecular epigenetic pathway components are emerging with the recent availability of an unprecedented number of sequenced genomes, the building blocks of specific molecular epigenetic pathways and their combinations are far from static in animal evolution. Functional studies will thus require an intricate understanding of the underlying toolbox before regulation and function in the context of physiological phenotypes can be adequately addressed. The evident diversity in epigenetic pathways in the animal kingdom offers the possibility to study epigenetic phenomena in unique models which, under the Krogh principle ("for… a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few such animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied " <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Krogh, 1929)</ref>), are sure to complement traditionally well-studied model organisms. For example, transgenerational inheritance described in C. elegans and D. melanogaster have been associated with molecular epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications, small non-coding RNAs and mA6 DNA methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aldrich and Maggert, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Rankin, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ciabrelli et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bozler et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Deas et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Ma et al., 2019)</ref>, which, in the absence of cytosine DNA methylation, can be studied more independently in these models. Conversely, zebrafish, which exhibit paternally inherited DNA methylation pattern in germ cells, are an excellent model system to study paternal contributions to offspring via this epigenetic pathway. In addition to differences in molecular epigenetic pathway components and functions, new animal models with the potential to push temporal boundaries due to a very short life-cycle have emerged and can equally be considered an application of the Krogh principal. For example, the mangrove killifish (Kryptolebias marmoratus), are unique among vertebrates as they possess not only a sexual reproductive strategy, but also a clonal one <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Fellous et al., 2019)</ref>. This has led to recently initiated studies aiming to dissociate genetic from epigenetic contributions to the emergence of plastic phenotypes in this species <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Berbel-Filho et al., 2019)</ref>. Finally, another killifish species, the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) exhibits an extremely rapid maturation and short life-cycle, offering a viable option to address normally time-consuming transgenerational studies in a vertebrate model <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">(Reichard and Polačik, 2019)</ref>. Finally, externally fertilizing species in general provide the advantage of easily accessible eggs <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Martinez et al., 2019)</ref>, and in many but not all cases, absence of parental behavior, which represents an important confound in epigenetic studies in rodent models <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Meaney and Szyf, 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Incorporation of emerging techniques to functionally explore the mechanistic basis of epigenetic regulation in animals</head><p>While it is technically feasible to comprehensively or specifically profile a plethora of genomes for epigenetic marks and study their epitranscriptome descriptively <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, an important question to address will be how specific molecular epigenetic marks contribute to the emergence of physiological phenotypes within and between generations. An initial consideration of importance is the separation of epigenetic mark-dependent and independent effects of epigenetic pathway protein components: Most, if not all epigenetic machinery proteins have cellular functions which are independent of the establishment of epigenetic molecular marks. This is important, because while phenotypic effects identified in KO models are often used as explanation of epigenetically regulated phenotypes, it is also possible that some phenotypic effects are mediated by protein functions, and are not related to epigenetic mark regulation. Given the widely observed differences in the encoded protein repertoire of molecular epigenetic pathways in animals, it is feasible that evolution has not only acted on conservation and innovation of epigenetic functions of these proteins, but also their other intracellular interactions. While specific non-coding RNAs, such as miRNAs, have successfully been manipulated in a variety of species to probe their developmental, physiological and intergenerational function <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Mishima et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Rodgers et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Mennigen et al., 2014)</ref>, especially chromatin and DNA level pathways could, for a long time, only be manipulated globally by using (transient) knock-out techniques of key enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">(Xia et al., 2018)</ref>, pharmacological inhibitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(Seebacher and Simmonds (2019)</ref>, or nutritional treatments, such as, for example dietary methionine which serves as the precursor of Sadenosylmethionine (SAM) methyl donor to affect DNA methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b255">(Zhang, 2018)</ref>.

Indeed, interaction between epigenetic molecular marks, such as transcriptional regulation of miRNA biogenesis by DNA methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Glaich et al., 2019)</ref> or nuclear-translocated epi-transcriptomic factors and DNA methylation have been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Fu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">Zhao et al., 2016</ref>), suggesting complex interplay of epigenetic molecular mechanisms. However, most comparative studies exploring molecular epigenetic marks analyze a single epigenetic mechanism in relation to mRNA and protein expression and abundance. Oftentimes, such comparisons do not yield a high level of predicted directional correlations with mRNA transcripts and/or protein abundance. Therefore, we suggest that future integrated in silico analysis may provide a path towards more accurate prediction of transcriptomic patterns. This endeavor is arguably a complex one, as in most studies examining epigenetic marks to-date, only a single time-point is analyzed, which neglects potential time-dependent interactions and may furthermore diminish the degree of predicted correlations in the process. A recent study exploring the role of oscillatory hepatic miRNA changes as drivers of metabolic fast-feeding switch serves as a valuable reminder to take dynamic epigenetic marks into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Maniyadath et al., 2019)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Comparative transgenerational epigenetics</head><p>In addition to intragenerational investigation of epigenetic determinants of physiological phenotypes, there has been interest in the exploration of the role of epigenetics in establishing inter-and transgenerational phenotypes.

While excellent reviews and theoretical frameworks of transgenerational inheritance have been published on the subject <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Crews and Gore, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Burggren and Crews, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Burggren, 2015)</ref>, we here aim to review recent developments in the field and prioritize research question from a comparative perspective.</p><p>From a purely mechanistic view, comparative approaches using animals which exhibit transgenerational effects in response to environmental (including anthropogenic) changes in absence of particular molecular epigenetic mechanisms regulating their genome, may prove fruitful to tease apart specific epigenetic modifications in a less complex epigenetic molecular toolbox. For example, transgenerational consequences of changed environmental factors in both the nematode C. elegans and the fruitfly D. melanogaster, which are characterized by an absence of DNA methylation, have been described and begun to be linked to non-cytosine DNA-methylation dependent epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone modification dependent changes in chromatin structure or non-coding RNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Ashe et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Rechavi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aldrich and Maggert, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Rankin, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ciabrelli et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pereira et al., 2020)</ref>.

Nevertheless, such lines of investigation will require germ-cell specific (single cell) sequencing approaches to confirm whether the absence of specific epigenetic molecular mechanisms do indeed apply to germ cells. An example of an application of such targeted epigenetic profiling is the confirmation of paternally inherited DNA methylation pattern in zebrafish, which, following the initial description at the whole zygote level <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Jiang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Potok et al., 2013)</ref>, have subsequently been confirmed to apply to germ cells specifically (Ortega-Recalde et al., 2019; <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">Skvortsova et al., 2019)</ref>. Comparative animal model with externally fertilization, such as zebrafish, provide advantages in accessibility of mature female germ cells for specific profiling of molecular epigenetic factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Martinez et al., 2019)</ref>. Furthermore, medaka has also been shown to follow mammalian-specific epigenetic germ cell reprogramming and has been proposed as a strong animal model to further understand the mechanisms for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance <ref type="bibr">Bhandari, 2020a, 2020b)</ref>. As there is tremendous variability in animal development and life-history traits including reproduction and sex determination, it is likely that qualitative and quantitative molecular epigenetic responses to environmental factors, organismal thresholds and windows of sensitivity and duration of epigenetic effects differ substantially between animals. For example, multigenerational (&gt; 5 generations) exposure to an attractive olfactory cue (benzaldehyde or citronellol) result in stable transmission of at least 9 generations in C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">(Remy, 2010)</ref>. This finding may either reflect that transgenerational inheritance penetrance is 1) generally underestimated due to experimental (animal model-related) time constraints, 2) that transgenerational penetration is larger following multi-generational persistence of environmental factors, 3) or that specific animals may indeed be exquisitely sensitive to epigenetic effects, matching generational penetrance of transgenerational effects reported in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Heard and Martienssen, 2014)</ref>. Comparative approaches to transgenerational epigenetics will also allow to specifically investigate different modes of parental behaviors in addition to different reproductive strategies in terms of output. For example, both within and between cohort variation in offspring may potentially affect epigenetic molecular marks dynamics and physiological outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Crews, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Martinez et al., 2019)</ref>. Finally, comparative approaches will allow to harness increasingly available genome information also to explore molecular epigenetic mechanisms in the context of duplicated teleost genomes retaining paralogues, for example. Animals with clonal reproductive strategies and/or isogenic lines, such as killifish, Daphnia and C. elegans may provide fruitful strategies to determine gene-environment interactions and provide insight into clonal lineage dependent establishment of epigenetic molecular marks <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Harris et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Fellous et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Houri-Ze'evi et al., 2020)</ref>. Importantly, short generational time in these models will also facilitate the explorations of effects across extended temporal time-scales, including potential interaction between environmental context-dependent molecular epigenetic changes in individuals between different generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bhandari et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Crews and Gore, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">McCormick et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b225">Vera-Chang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Heckwolf et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to elucidating species-specific epigenetic molecular repertoires and their role in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, comparative approaches may also allow to shed light into potentially deeply conserved mechanisms involved in epigenetic transgenerational inheritance in animals. The question however remains as to whether specific conserved signal transduction pathways act similarly to alter germ-cell and somatic epigenetics marks across development and this is best using a comparative approach. Similarly, comparative approaches will allow researchers to test the general validity of hypothesized adaptiveness of epigenetic transgenerational phenotypes as opposed to dysregulation of epigenetic genome control to environmental change. Moreover, it will be possible to explore whether evidence form laboratory-based epigenetic transgenerational effects translates into more ecologically relevant complex environments, such as mesocosm and/or field studies, in most animals or only in animals particularly sensitive to epigenetic transgenerational inheritance. Similarly, comparative approaches may allow to determine general and/or species-specific principles of how molecular epigenetic control of plasticity may translate into evolutionary consequences (Guerrero-Bosagna, 2017).</p></div>

Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology -Part D 36 (2020) 100745</ref> which play important roles in animal adaptation and evolution. We are only beginning to elucidate these mechanisms in nonmammalian models, and there is much work to do to characterize the full repertoire of epigenetic regulators. Perhaps most exciting moving forward are the potential applications for such knowledge in translational studies and the applied sciences. In addition to comparative physiological insights, applying epigenetics is expected to aid in solving problems in agriculture (e.g. pest control), aquaculture (e.g. maintaining and selecting fish stocks), conservation (e.g. trout migration methylome) and ecotoxicology (e.g. risk assessment of chemical exposure). Taken together, conducting epigenetic studies informs on best practices for selective breeding for desired traits, maintenance and protection of animal stocks, and improves understanding into multigenerational effects of environmental stressors and pollution. This critical review and special issue in comparative physiology and biochemistry provides a window into this potential and reveals the exciting potential of such applications in comparative animal physiology.</p></div>

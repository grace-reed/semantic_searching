			<abstract>
				<p>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an imprinted neurodevelopmental disease caused by a loss of paternal genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. It is characterized by cognitive impairments, developmental delay, sleep abnormalities, and hyperphagia often leading to obesity. Clinical research has shown that a lack of expression of SNORD116, a paternally expressed imprinted gene cluster that encodes multiple copies of a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) in both humans and mice, is most likely responsible for many PWS symptoms seen in humans. The majority of previous research using PWS preclinical models focused on characterization of the hyperphagic and metabolic phenotypes. However, a crucial understudied clinical phenotype is cognitive impairments and thus we investigated the learning and memory abilities using a model of PWS, with a heterozygous deletion in Snord116. We utilized the novel object recognition task, which doesn&apos;t require external motivation, or exhaustive swim training. Automated findings were further confirmed with manual scoring by a highly trained blinded investigator. We discovered deficits in Snord116+/− mutant mice in the novel object recognition, location memory and tone cue fear conditioning assays when compared to age-, sex-matched, littermate control Snord116+/+ mice. Further, we confirmed that despite physical neo-natal developmental delays, Snord116+/ − mice had normal exploratory and motor abilities. These results show that the Snord116+/− deletion murine model is a valuable preclinical model for investigating learning and memory impairments in individuals with PWS without common confounding phenotypes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder that occurs in approximately 1:15,000 live births. PWS is characterized by neonatal failure to thrive, developmental delay, lack of satiety cues, lack of control of food intake and metabolic abnormalities that lead to obesity. In addition to obesity, PWS affected individuals usually exhibit low to moderate intellectual disability and issues with numerous tasks related to executive function (e.g., response inhibition, set-shifting and planning) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dykens, Hodapp, Walsh, &amp; Nash, 1992a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, 1992b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dykens, Leckman, &amp; Cassidy, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dykens et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dykens and Shah, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Martin et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Schwartz et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Due to the imprinted status of the 15q11-q13 locus, allele-specific mutations lead to the development of two distinct neurodevelopmental disorders. PWS results from genetic mutations leading to deficient gene expression from the paternal allele of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13), while Angelman Syndrome (AS) results from mutations inherited from the maternal allele of the same locus, emphasizing a critical neurological function of these genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jiang, Tsai, Bressler, &amp; Beaudet, 1998)</ref>. Numerous mutant mouse models were generated by targeting different portions of the orthologous mouse region. The first model deleted the entire PWS/AS locus, similar to the vast majority of PWS and/or AS patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gabriel et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Stefan, Portis, Longnecker, &amp; Nicholls, 2005)</ref>. Follow-up model systems highlighted the PWS imprinting center and informed the essential nature of the epigenetic processes <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al., 1998)</ref>. Several smaller deletion and single gene mutant model systems have been created to delineate the contribution of each gene in the region to aspects of the PWS phenotype. These include models deleting exons in the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (Snrpn), an RNA-protein complex that forms an RNA spliceosome <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bressler et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dubose, Smith, Yang, Johnstone, &amp; Resnick, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Tsai, Jiang, et al., 1999)</ref>, necdin (Ndn), which can influence multiple pathways involved in neuronal survival, differentiation and outgrowth and Magel2, a Ndn homolog that is expressed in the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex and spinal cord and key in circadian timekeeping <ref type="bibr">(Kozlov et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lee et al., 2000)</ref>.</p><p>While many genes are likely involved in the entire complicated PWS phenotype (including developmental failure to thrive, metabolic anomalies, obesity, cognitive deficits, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and other psychiatric co-morbidities), analyses of rare PWS patients have determined that a ∼200 kb deletion of a cluster of small nucleolar/noncoding RNAs (snoRNAs) within this locus is sufficient to cause PWS <ref type="bibr">(Bieth et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">de Smith et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Duker et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sahoo et al., 2008)</ref>. Thus, investigation into the loss of this particular group of snoRNA genes, known as the Snord116 cluster, as contributing factors is an essential step toward elucidating the neurobiology of the PWS phenotype. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ding et al. (2008)</ref> derived a novel mouse model for PWS by deleting the paternal copies of Snord116. Mice with paternally inherited Snord116+/− deletions had growth delays in the first three postnatal weeks, hyperphagia, prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin but normal pain sensitivity, motor abilities and working memory measured by the spontaneous alternation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ding et al., 2008)</ref>.  observed significant changes in working-for-food behavioral responses at various timescales in a home cage behavioral system in Snord116+/− mice . It is unknown how or if the missing Snord116 cluster contributes to other components of the intellectual disability behavioral diagnosis in clinical populations since the overwhelming majority of previous research using PWS preclinical models focused on characterization of the hyperphagic and metabolic phenotypes. The following report carefully investigated learning and memory abilities in the heterozygous deletion Snord116+/− model of PWS. We discovered that Snord116+/− mice exhibited learning and memory impairments compared to their wildtype littermates on the low stress-standard assays of novel object recognition (NOR) and object location memory (OLM). Second, we illustrated data that were quantified with reasonable signal to noise ratio by automated tracking software, and confirmed and fine-tuned by human manual scoring. We also discovered that the Snord116+/− group showed deficits in cued but not contextual fear conditioning. Finally, we confirmed our results were not confounded by physical or motor dysfunction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Subjects</head><p>All animals were housed in a temperature-controlled vivarium maintained on a 12:12 light-dark cycle. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California Davis and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. B6(Cg)-Snord116 tm1.1Uta /J (Snord116+/−) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and fed a standard diet of Teklad global 18% protein rodent diets 2918 (Envigo, Hayward, CA, USA). Heterozygous deletion male mice were bred with C57BL/6J females to generate paternal deletion Snord116+/− and wildtype (Snord116+/+) littermates. To identify mice, pups were labelled by paw tattoo over postnatal days (PND) 2-4 using non-toxic animal tattoo ink (Ketchum Manufacturing Inc., Brockville, ON, Canada). Tails of pups were clipped (1-2 mm) for genotyping, following the UC Davis IACUC policy regarding tissue collection. Genotyping was performed with REDExtract-N-Amp (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) using primers oIMR7958 AAT CCC CAA CCT ACT TCA AAC AGT C, oIMR7959 TGG ATC TCT CCT TGC TTG TTT TCT C, and oIMR7960 TTT ACG GTA CAT GAC AGC ACT CAA G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Behavioral assays</head><p>Order of behavioral testing and description of cohorts. To determine if findings were robust and reproducible 2 cohorts were used for the novel object recognition assessment. The second cohort was also used to assess developmental milestones at PND10, 12 and 14, elevated plus maze, light ↔ dark conflict, open field behavior, balance beam walking, object location memory and fear conditioning. To minimize the carry-over effects from repeated testing, assays were performed in the order of least to the most stressful tasks. Cohort 1 was sampled from 7 litters and was tested in novel object recognition (NOR). Cohort 2 was sampled from 6 litters and was tested in elevated plus-maze, light ↔ dark, open field, beam walking, NOR, object location memory (OLM), and context and cued fear conditioning. All male and female mice were used from every litter. In cohort 1, the order and age of testing was as follows: (1) NOR at 7 weeks of age. In cohort 2, the order of testing was as follows with at least 48-hrs separating tasks: (1) PND 10, 12, 14 developmental milestones, (2) elevated plus-maze at 6 weeks of age, (3) light ↔ dark exploration task at 6 weeks of age, <ref type="formula">4</ref>open field locomotion at 7 weeks of age, (5) balance beam walking at weeks of age, (6) NOR at 8 weeks of age, (7) OLM at 10 weeks of age, and (8) fear conditioning at 12 weeks of age. All behavioral assays in all cohorts were performed between 9 am-4 pm PST (ZT2-ZT9).</p><p>(i) Developmental milestones.</p><p>Developmental milestones were measured on postnatal days (PND) 10, 12 and 14, similar to those previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fox, 1965;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vogel Ciernia et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang et al., 2012)</ref>. All measures were conducted by an experimenter blind to genotype. Body weight, length (nose to edge of tail), and head width were measured using a scale (grams) and a digital caliper (cm). Cliff avoidance was tested by placing each pup near the edge of a cardboard box, gently nudging it towards the edge, and measuring the time for it to turn and back away from the edge. Failures to avoid the cliff was recorded as a maximum score of 30-s. Righting reflex was tested by placing each pup on its back, releasing it, and measuring the time for it to fully flip over onto four paws on each developmental day. Negative geotaxis was tested by placing each pup, facing downwards, on a screen angled at 45°from parallel, and measuring the time for it to completely turn and to climb to the top of the screen. Failures to turn and climb were recorded as a maximum score of 30-s. Circle transverse was tested by placing each pup in the center of a circle with a 5″ (12.5 cm) diameter drawn on a laminated sheet of 8.5″ × 11″ white paper, and measuring the time for it to exit the circle. Failures to exit the circle were recorded as a maximum score of 30-s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(ii) Novel object recognition (NOR).</head><p>The NOR test was conducted in opaque matte white (P95 White, Tap Plastics, Sacramento, CA) open field arenas (41 cm × 41 cm × 30 cm), using methods similar to those previously described <ref type="bibr">(Copping, Christian, et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gompers et al., 2017)</ref>. The experiment consisted of four sessions: a 30-min exposure to the open field arena the day before the test, a 10-min re-habituation on test day, a 10-min familiarization session and a 5-min recognition test. On day 1, each subject was habituated to a clean, empty open field arena for 30-min. 24-hr later, each subject was returned to the open field arena for another 10min for the habituation phase. The mouse was then removed from the open field and placed in a clean temporary holding cage for approximately 2-min. Two identical objects were placed in the arena. Each subject was returned to the open field in which it had been habituated and allowed to freely explore for 10-min. After the familiarization session, subjects were returned to their holding cages, which were transferred from the testing room to a nearby holding area. The open field was cleaned with 70% ethanol and let dry. One clean familiar object and one clean novel object were placed in the arena, where the two identical objects had been located during in the familiarization phase. 60-min after the end of the familiarization session, each subject was returned to its open field for a 5-min recognition test, during which time it was allowed to freely explore the familiar object and the novel object. The familiarization session and the recognition test were recorded and scored with Ethovision XT videotracking software (Version 9.0, Noldus Information Technologies, Leesburg, VA). Object investigation was defined as time spent sniffing the object when the nose was oriented toward the object and the nose-object distance was 2-cm or less. Recognition memory was defined as spending significantly more time sniffing the novel object compared to the familiar object via a Student's paired t-test. Total time spent sniffing both objects was used as a measure of general exploration. Time spent sniffing two identical objects during the familiarization phase confirmed the lack of an innate side bias. Objects used were plastic toys: a small soft plastic orange safety cone and a hard plastic magnetic cone with ribbed sides, as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gompers et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gulinello et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(iii) Object location memory (OLM).</formula><p>The OLM test was conducted as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Vogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Yang, Lewis, Sarvi, Foley, &amp; Crawley, 2015)</ref>, in the same apparatus used for testing NOR. Each animal was habituated to a clean empty arena for 30-min, 24-hrs before the experiment, and again for another 10-min on the day of the experiment. The subject was then exposed to two identical objects (red coral object, ∼2.5 cm tall, Safari Ltd.) placed 12-cm away from the wall and 18-cm from each other) for a 10-min familiarization session. To facilitate spatial memory, a 2 × 30cm vertical black stripe was taped on the wall opposite to the start location. To test OLM, one familiar object remained at the original location and the second familiar object was displaced 18-cm from its original location. The relocated object was diagonal to, and 22-cm from, the unmoved object. OLM was tested in a 5-min session, beginning 1-hr after the familiarization session. Object investigation was analyzed with Ethovision XT videotracking software and from the digital recorded videos, by human observers blind to genotype information.</p><p>(iv) Open field locomotion.</p><p>General exploratory locomotion in a novel open field environment was assayed in an arena sized 40 cm× 40 cm × 30.5 cm, as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Copping, Berg, et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Copping, Christian, et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gompers et al., 2017)</ref>. Open field activity was considered an essential control for effects on physical activity, for example, sedation or hyperactivity which could confound the interpretation of result of interaction with objects, arena and object exploration, and sniffing and investigation times. The testing room was illuminated at ∼40 lx.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(v) Beam walking.</formula><p>A beam walking motor task was conducted as previously described, with some modifications as outlined <ref type="bibr">(Carter et al., 2001, chap. 8;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vogel Ciernia et al., 2017)</ref>. 59 cm long round rods were suspended 68 cm above a cushioned landing pad. A goal box at the end of the beam consisted of a 12 cm diameter cylinder to provide motivation to cross the beam. Each mouse was placed at one end of the beam and the time to cross to the goal box on the other end was measured. Testing sequence moved from largest diameter to smallest diameter rods in order of increased difficulty. On the day prior to testing, all animals were given two practice trials on the largest diameter round beam in order to become accustom to the procedure. On the test day, each animal was sequentially tested on three round rods (35, 18 and 13 mm). Testing sequence was based on presentations of decreasing diameter to present increasing levels of difficulty. Each mouse was given two trials on each beam, separated by approximately 30 min. The time to transverse the beam was recorded and averaged across the two trials for each beam. A maximum time of 60 s was assigned to individuals that failed to cross the beam in that duration. In the small number of cases where mice fell from the beam, a score of 60-s was assigned.</p><p>(vi) Elevated plus-maze (EPM).</p><p>The assay was performed using a mouse EPM (model ENV-560A) purchased from Med Associates (St. Albans, VT) and performed as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Copping, Christian, et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Flannery et al., 2015)</ref>. The EPM contained two open arms (35.5 cm × 6 cm) and two closed arms (35.5 cm × 6 cm) radiating from a central area (6 cm × 6 cm). The maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol before the beginning of the first test session and after each subject mouse was tested with sufficient time for the ethanol odor to dissipate before the start of the next test session. Room illumination was ∼30 lx.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(vii) Light ↔ dark conflict.</formula><p>The light ↔ dark assay was performed in accordance with previously described procedures <ref type="bibr">(Copping, Christian, et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Flannery et al., 2015)</ref>. The test began by placing the mouse in the light side (∼320 lx; 28 cm × 27.5 cm × 27 cm) of an automated 2-chambered apparatus, in which the enclosed/dark side (∼5 lx; 28 cm × 27.5 cm × 19 cm) was reached by traversing the small opening of the partition between the two chambers. The mouse was allowed to explore freely for 10-min. Time in the dark side chamber and total number of transitions between the light and dark side chambers were automatically recorded during the 10-min session using Labview 8.5.1 software (National Instruments, Austin, TX).</p><p>(viii) Contextual and cued fear conditioning.</p><p>Delay contextual and cued fear conditioning was conducted using an automated fear-conditioning chamber (Med Associates, St Albans, VT, USA). The conditioning chamber was interfaced to a PC installed with VideoFreeze software (version 1.12.0.0, Med Associates) and enclosed in a sound-attenuating cubicle. Training consisted of a 2-min acclimation period followed by three tone-shock (CS-US) pairings (80 dB tone, duration 30-s; 0.5 mA footshock, duration 1 s; intershock interval 90-s) and a 2.5-min period, during which no stimuli were presented. The environment was well lit (∼100 lx), with a stainless steel grid floor and swabbed with almond odor cue (prepared from almond extract; McCormick; 1:100 dilution). A 5-min test of contextual fear conditioning was performed 24-hr after training, in the absence of the tone and footshock, but in the presence of 100 lx overhead lighting, almond odor and chamber cues identical to those used on the training day. Cued fear conditioning, conducted 48-hr after training, was assessed in a novel environment with distinct visual, tactile and orange olfactory cues. Overhead lighting was turned off. The cued test consisted of a 3-min acclimation period followed by a 3-min presentation of the tone CS and a 90-s exploration period.

Statistical testing was performed using established assay-specific methods, including Student's t-test for single parameter comparisons between genotypes, and one-way or two-way repeatedmeasures ANOVA for comparisons across time points (e.g., development, pre-and post-fear conditioning, open field and beam walking). All significance levels were set at p &lt; 0.05 and all t-tests were twotailed. Groups sizes were chosen based on past experience and power analyses (Sukoff Rizzo and Silverman, 2016). Significant ANOVAs were followed by Bonferroni-Dunn posthoc testing. Behavioral analysis passed distribution normality tests, was collected using continuous variables and thus was analyzed via parametric analysis in all assays. For all behavioral analyses, variances were similar between groups and data points within 2 standard deviations of the mean were included in analysis. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows delayed early physical development and neurological reflexes in various parameters in Snord116+/− compared to Snord116+/+ littermates.

PWS arises by paternal 15q11-13 deletions, maternal uniparental disomy, or imprinting errors which lead to aberrant methylation and downregulation of paternally expressed transcripts. Genetic mapping data from unique "microdeletion" patients suggest SNORD116, is a critical mediator of the neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Therefore, we evaluated a mouse model of paternally inherited Snord116 deletion on physical characteristics and functional outcome measures. For the first time, we reliably identified the clinically <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Snord116+/− displayed impairments on the object location memory (OLM) task by manual and automated quantification measures.

Two identical objects were placed 12-cm away from the wall and 18-cm from each other) for a 10-min familiarization session. (A) Snord116+/− mice do not spend more time sniffing the displaced object in the new location as compared to the object in the original location. Snord116+/+ littermates spend more time sniffing the displaced object in the new location when compared to familiar location. (B) Automated scoring via Noldus Ethovision 9.0XT illustrated Snord116+/− mice do not spend more time in the zone defined around the displaced object versus the zone defined around the familiar location, while Snord116+/+ exhibit this object location memory (p = 0.09) during the 5-min testing phase. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.

The outcome parameter of time spent in zone of close proximity using Noldus 9.0XT automated tracking software was corroborated by an expert technician blinded to genotype that scored time spent sniffing the objects manually. Both methods produced quantifiable data with reasonable signal to noise ratio. However, we discovered that only manual observation was able to eliminate misdetections in the automated tracking such as subjects knocking over objects, subjects sitting on objects, subjects grooming next to objects, and/or when the nose and tail detection indicator points switch amongst one another.</p><p>Our study also discovered deficits of the Snord116+/− mutants in learning and memory by OLM on which rodents are presented with two identical, familiar objects, one of which is in its previous location while the other is in a new location.

The NOR and OLM impairments were detected in the typical short-term range by a 1hr time interval between familiarization and testing. This window is thought to occur within the consolidation phase of memory formation and may not be dependent on protein synthesis. Snord116+/− mutants showed impairments in cued but not contextual fear conditioning.

For example, rodents with amygdala lesions show attenuated neophobia for novel food <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Burns, Annett, Kelley, Everitt, &amp; Robbins, 1996)</ref>. Moreover, a rich literature of lesion work indicated that specific but different brain regions appear to regulate cued versus contextual fear conditioning. Although the responses of behavioral freezing elicited by contextual and cued fear conditioning are identical, the processing demands underlying the two forms of fear conditioning are different. The preponderance of the evidence supports the hypothesis that primary sensory information from the auditory thalamus into the lateral amygdala mediate cued fear conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Phillips and LeDoux, 1992;</ref> while contextual fear conditioning require both the amygdala and the hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Phillips and LeDoux, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Maren and Holt, 2000)</ref>.

We extended these phenotypic outcomes by also quantifying smaller body lengths and smaller head circumferences.

Interestingly, other standard neonatal neurological reflexes such as negative geotaxis, righting reflex and cliff aversion remained intact. We confirmed that the cognitive deficits observed in Snord116+/− mice were not the result of confounding motor hypoactivity, despite the substantial growth delays in the first 2 weeks of postnatal life.

These deficits in the Snord116 +/− mouse model highlight the critical role of Snord116+/− in PWS and extend validity of the model as a valuable preclinical tool for investigating learning and memory impairments in PWS.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Physical characteristics, milestone development and neurological reflexes at postnatal days 10, 12 and 14 in Snord116+/+ and Snord116+/− mice.</figDesc><table><row><cell>A.

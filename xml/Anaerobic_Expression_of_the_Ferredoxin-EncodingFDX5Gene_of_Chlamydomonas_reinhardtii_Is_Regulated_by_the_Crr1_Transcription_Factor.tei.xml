			<abstract>
				<p>The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a complex anaerobic metabolism and reacts to hypoxic or anaerobic conditions with the induced expression of many genes. One gene which is upregulated particularly strongly is the FDX5 gene, encoding one of at least six ferredoxin isoforms in C. reinhardtii. Fdx5 is a typical plant-type 2Fe2S protein that is located in the chloroplast. The FDX5 promoter region contains three GTAC motifs, which are known to be the binding sites for copper response regulator 1 (Crr1) and other SQUAMOSA promoter binding proteins (SBPs). This study shows that two of these GTAC sites are essential to confer oxygen and also copper responsiveness to a reporter gene. The SBP domain of Crr1 is able to bind to both of these GTAC sites in in vitro binding assays. Moreover, in a Crr1-deficient C. reinhardtii strain, FDX5 is not expressed. These results clearly indicate that Crr1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the FDX5 gene in the absence of oxygen or copper.</p>

By analyzing algal transformants carrying the CRLUC gene under the control of the putative FDX5 promoter, we could identify two critical GTAC motifs that are essential for the transcriptional activation of the FDX5 gene. The SBP domain of C. reinhardtii Crr1 is able to bind these GTAC cores, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Eventually, we confirmed that FDX5 is a strict Crr1 target by showing that a Crr1-deficient C. reinhardtii strain is not able to accumulate FDX5 transcripts or the Fdx5 protein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>Organisms and growth conditions. All C. reinhardtii strains (wild type CC-125 [mt ϩ 137C], cell-wall-less strain CC-425, and crr1 mutant strain CC-3960 crr1-2arg7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>) were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Culture Collection at Duke University. If not indicated otherwise, stocks and precultures were grown in Tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (9) at a light intensity of 80 mol of photons ⅐ s Ϫ1 ⅐ m Ϫ2 and at a temperature of 20°C.</p><p>To analyze CRLUC expression in recombinant C. reinhardtii strains carrying chimeric constructs of CRLUC under the control of various fragments of the putative FDX5 promoter, individual colonies from each transformation were grown in 12 ml TAP in 15 ml Sarstedt centrifuge tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) in light (80 mol of photons ⅐ s Ϫ1 ⅐ m Ϫ2 ). After the cultures had reached a chlorophyll concentration of about 20 g ⅐ ml Ϫ1 , conditions known to induce FDX5 gene expression were applied, as described below.</p><p>Sulfur (S) deprivation of strains CC-425 and CC-3960 was achieved as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>. For analyzing a large number of individual C. reinhardtii transformants, experiments were conducted with 12-ml-headspace bottles (Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) with an 11-ml culture volume, sealed with 20-mm butyl rubber stoppers (Alltech, Rottenburg-Hailfingen, Germany). A 5-mm glass bead was added to each vessel to improve mixing of the cells. The flasks were incubated on a reciprocal shaker and illuminated from the bottom with 80 mol of photons ⅐ s Ϫ1 ⅐ m Ϫ2 . The algal cells were used for luciferase activity assays after 72 h of S deficiency. At this time point, the cultures were hypoxic and producing hydrogen, as confirmed by gas chromatography (using a GC-2010 gas chromatograph [Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan] equipped with a Plot fused silica-coated Molsieve column [5Å, 10 m by 0.32 mm; Varian, Palo Alto, CA]) (data not shown).</p><p>Anaerobic adaptation by N 2 flushing was conducted as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>. To anaerobically adapt many individual C. reinhardtii transformants, the protocol was modified: C. reinhardtii cultures were grown in 15-ml Sarstedt tubes, concentrated to 80 g chlorophyll ⅐ ml Ϫ1 , filled in 8-ml headspace bottles, and sealed with red rubber Suba-Seals 25 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The flasks were wrapped in aluminum foil and bubbled with N 2 via syringes piercing through the septa for 30 min. The vessels were then incubated on a shaker for 3 h in the dark without gassing, before samples for determining luciferase activity were taken. When indicated, in vitro hydrogenase activity in the cell cultures was determined as described in detail previously by Hemschemeier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>.</p><p>To induce Cu deficiency, C. reinhardtii cultures were grown once in TAP ENEA2 medium as reported previously by Ferrante et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref>, before a main culture was inoculated with 1 ml of the preculture and incubated at a light intensity of 80 mol of photons ⅐ s Ϫ1 ⅐ m Ϫ2 . As soon as the cells had reached a chlorophyll concentration of 3 g ⅐ ml Ϫ1 , the Cu chelator triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (TETA) was added to a final concentration of 50 M. For analyzing C. reinhardtii transformants, Cu depletion was carried out in a culture volume of 40 ml in 50-ml Sarstedt tubes for 96 h before luciferase activity was determined. For RNA isolation, 200 ml of Cu-deficient culture was prepared in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks.</p><p>Transformation of C. reinhardtii. The transformation of C. reinhardtii strain CC-125 was done according to a glass bead method (15) after treatment with autolysin. Cells were transformed by using 1.5 g of ScaI-linearized plasmids (described below) and plated onto TAP agar plates. After incubation in low light for 24 h, the agar blocks were transferred onto fresh petri dishes containing a filter paper soaked with paromomycin solution to obtain a final concentration of g ⅐ ml <ref type="bibr">Ϫ1</ref> . Luciferase activity assay. For determining luciferase activity, 200 l of sulfurdeprived or anaerobically adapted cultures was removed with a syringe from the incubation flask by piercing through the rubber seals and transferred into the individual wells of a 96-well plate (96-well white microplate; Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Background light emission was detected for 10 s on a photon-counting microplate luminometer (Orion microplate luminometer connected to a personal computer [PC] with Simplicity software 2.1; Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). Next, 0.5 l of 2 mM coelenterazine (PJK GmbH, Kleinblittersdorf, Germany) in methanol was added to the cell samples, and light emission was detected for 10 s again.</p><p>In the case of Cu-depleted cells, 2 ml of each culture was disrupted by freezing in liquid nitrogen, thawing, and subsequent sonication three times for 30 s (Transsonic T 460; Elma, Singen, Germany). The cell lysates were stored in liquid nitrogen until the analysis occurred. For measurements of luciferase activity, 200 l of thawed lysates was transferred into multiwell plates as described above.</p><p>Construction of plasmids. In order to circumvent the necessity of cotransformation, plasmids containing both the codon-optimized luciferase gene from R. reniformis (CRLUC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref> and the paromomycin resistance cassette aphVIII, which was under the control of the HSP70 promoter ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c)</ref>, were constructed.</p><p>CRLUC was obtained by digesting plasmid pCrLuc (6) with BamHI and XhoI and ligating the fragment into the BamHI-and XhoI-cut vector pBS(Ϫ) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to obtain plasmid pBSLuc. The numbers below the motifs indicate their positions relative to the TS. (Bottom) Scheme of the reporter gene constructs generated in this study, in which the CRLUC gene was fused to various fragments of the putative FDX5 promoter.

(c) Schematic drawing of ScaI-linearized plasmid pCL20 used for generating the reporter gene constructs carrying both the paromomycin resistance cassette (aphVIII cassette) and the codon-adapted CRLUC gene. FDX5 promoter constructs were inserted via ApaI and XhoI. LAMBERTZ ET AL.</p><p>EUKARYOT. CELL Vector pSL18 (37) was used as a template to amplify the aphVIII gene by PCR, including the 5Ј and 3Ј untranslated regions (UTRs) of the C. reinhardtii RBCS2 gene and the 5Ј region of HSP70A, and to add flanking PdiI restriction sites by using oligonucleotides TTGCCGGCGGTACCCGCTTCAAATACGC and CG GCCGGCGAGCTCGCTGAGGCTTGACA (PdiI sites are underlined). The amplificate was inserted into pGemT-Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) to obtain plasmid pGemParo.</p><p>The aphVIII cassette was cut from pGemParo by PdiI digestion and inserted into PdiI-cut pBSLuc, which resulted in plasmid pBSLucParo. Finally, the KpnI restriction site in plasmid pBSLucParo was removed, since the KpnI site contains a GTAC motif, which might have falsified the reporter gene analysis. To eliminate the KpnI site, pBSLucParo was digested with Acc65I, treated with S1 nuclease (Gibco BRL/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and finally religated, resulting in plasmid pCL20. pCL20 was used to produce chimeric constructs in which the CRLUC gene was under the control of various fragments of the putative FDX5 promoter. Different fragments of the FDX5 upstream region were amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotides listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> on genomic DNA as a template. Genomic DNA was isolated from C. reinhardtii strain CC-125 by using a slightly modified version of a method described previously by Newman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(28)</ref>.</p><p>The individual PCR products were digested with XhoI and ApaI and inserted into pCL20 digested by the same endonucleases. Mutations within some fragments of the putative FDX5 promoter were inserted by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutation ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). All constructs were sequenced at the sequencing facility at the Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany (Department of Biochemistry I, Receptor Biochemistry).</p><p>RNA analysis, RT-PCR, and 5-RACE PCR. Total RNA was isolated according to a method described previously by Johanningmeier and Howell <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(14)</ref>. Most parts of genomic DNA contamination were removed by LiCl precipitation. Ten micrograms of total RNA was treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 0.5 g of the DNase-treated RNA was used as a template for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to detect the transcripts of CRLUC (using oligonucleotides CGATGGCCTTGATCTTGTCCTGGT and GCAGATGAACGT GCTGGACAGCTT), FDX5 (CGGCTTCATCCTCATGTGCT and ACGCTG ACACGAATGGTACG), and RPL10a (CCAAGTGCAGCATCAAGTTC and CACGTTCTGCCAGTTCTTCT).</p><p>For identifying the transcription start point (TS) of the FDX5 gene, 5Ј rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5Ј-RACE) PCR was applied by using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.</p><p>RNA hybridization analyses were conducted with 20 g of each sample of total RNA according to standard techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(35)</ref>, using digoxigenin-labeled probes complementary to RPL10a (encoding ribosomal protein L10a; JGI v4.0 protein identification 195585) and FDX5 (JGI v4.0 protein identification 156833). Probe fragments were produced by PCR using oligonucleotides FDX5for (CGGCTTCATCC TCATGTGCT), FDX5rev (ACGCTGACACGAATGGTACG), L10afor (CCAA GTGCAGCATCAAGTTC), and L10arev (CACGTTCTGCCAGTTCTTCT).</p><p>Heterologous expression of the Crr1 SBP domain, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and other biochemical methods. The SBP domain of C. reinhardtii Crr1 was heterologously produced in Escherichia coli and purified by His tag chromatography as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, except that Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen/Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used. The CRR1 cDNA fragment encoding a truncated polypeptide from amino acids 428 to 524 (numbers correspond to the Crr1 sequence reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>) was present in plasmid pet15SBP, which was kindly donated by Frederik Sommer, Potsdam, Germany. After purification of the polypeptide, the success of the purification was proven by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Coomassie staining. The protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay (2a) (data not shown).</p><p>An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was done by using a secondgeneration digoxigenin (DIG) gel shift kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), according to the manual provided by the manufacturer, except that 1 mM ZnCl was added to the DNA-protein samples. Thirty-six-base-pair-long oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild type or mutated parts of the putative FDX5 promoter (details are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a)</ref> were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Two hundred nanograms of the heterologously produced Crr1 SBP domain and 60 fmol of the individual double-stranded fragments were used for each sample. After incubation, samples were separated via 0.5ϫ TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA buffer) native PAGE and blotted onto a nylon membrane by electroblotting (400 mA for 30 min). Fragments were visualized via chemiluminescence after immunodetection with anti-digoxigenin antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase.</p><p>Western blot analyses with polyclonal anti-C. reinhardtii Fdx5 antibody were done as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(13)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1a)</ref>, as was shown previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39)</ref>. By applying RT-PCR analyses using mRNA samples isolated from C. reinhardtii cells under different conditions of O 2 or Cu availability, no FDX5 transcript could be detected in aerobic C. reinhardtii cultures in the presence of Cu, whereas strong signals appeared in samples from algal cells that had become anaerobic due to sulfur depletion in the light <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(18)</ref> or N flushing in the dark or from Cu-depleted, aerobic cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1a)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FDX5 transcription depends on two GTAC motifs in both anaerobiosis and copper depletion. FDX5 transcripts accumulate in the absence of both O 2 and Cu</head><p>To gain insights into the regulatory elements within the putative FDX5 promoter, we first carried out a 5Ј-RACE analysis. The FDX5 transcription start (position ϩ1) was found 99 nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon (position ϩ100). This results in a 5Ј untranslated region (UTR) that is 14 bp longer than that indicated by gene model au5.g7064_t1 in JGI 4.0.</p><p>In silico analyses of the putative FDX5 promoter region 1 to 300 bp upstream of the transcription start point (TS) revealed the presence of three GTAC motifs at positions Ϫ116, Ϫ96, and Ϫ74 relative to the TS <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1b)</ref>. GTAC cores were shown previously to be essential for the activation of transcription by the Crr1 transcription factor under both Cu-deficient and hypoxic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34)</ref>. To analyze the role of these three GTAC motifs in the regulation of the FDX5 gene, chimeric constructs of the CRLUC gene (6) under the control of various fragments of the putative FDX5 promoter were generated. The FDX5 promoter fragments were chosen to contain three, two, or only one of the GTAC motifs as well as GTAC motifs in which single point mutations (GTAC3ATAC) were introduced <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1b)</ref>. These constructs were used to transform C. reinhardtii wild-type strain CC-125, and the resulting transformants were exposed to S deprivation in the light, N 2 bubbling in the dark, or Cu deficiency to analyze the dimensions of luciferase activity under these conditions.</p><p>Several (19 to 55) randomly chosen transformants of each library were analyzed. Smaller numbers of strains were exam- ined when significant luciferase activity was detected. In cases where no activity was measured, we increased the amount of sample to clearly confirm the result. The luciferase activities in S-deprived C. reinhardtii transformants carrying the various chimeric constructs are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a</ref>. Only for strains car-rying the constructs CL24 and CL27, including all three or the two proximal (positions Ϫ96 and Ϫ74) GTAC motifs, respectively, could a significant luciferase activity of 400 to 500 relative luminescence units (RLU) be detected. In C. reinhardtii, transformants carrying the CRLUC gene under the control of larger parts of the FDX5 promoter than those present in CL24 (up to 1,549 bp, including an additional GTAC motif at position Ϫ359) did not exhibit significantly higher RLU values (data not shown). However, the deletion of the two distal GTAC motifs at positions Ϫ116 and Ϫ96 (CL30) or single point mutations in both or one of each of the two proximal GTAC sites (positions Ϫ96 and Ϫ74) (CL31, CL32, and CL36) were sufficient to prevent the expression of CRLUC, as indicated by a very low luciferase activity of about 20 RLU. This value is comparable to that of the usually observed background signal (about 12 RLU) also detected in transformants carrying the construct CL20 with a promoterless CRLUC gene ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a)</ref>.</p><p>It is noteworthy that a construct containing all three GTAC motifs but a single point mutation in the most proximal GTAC motif at position Ϫ74 (CL41) did not allow CRLUC expression, either. The same C. reinhardtii transformants were analyzed for luciferase activity after being flushed with N in the dark to confirm that the luciferase activity detected in sulfur-depleted, anaerobic cells was indeed due to the absence of O rather than to the absence of sulfur. However, no luciferase activity could be detected by using the luminometer. Therefore, mRNA was isolated from 10 to 15 individual transformants of each library and used to analyze CRLUC transcription by RT-PCR <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. These analyses showed the presence of CRLUC transcripts in anaerobic strains carrying the constructs CL24 and CL27 but not in the other transformants ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2b)</ref> and therefore revealed the same pattern of CRLUC expression as what had been observed as luciferase activity in sulfur-depleted C. reinhardtii transformants.</p><p>Finally, the transformants were subjected to Cu deficiency. It is known that conditions of trace element deficiency are difficult to establish, since the diminutive amounts that are essential for an organism can be supplied even by diffusion out of glassware or by the entry of dust <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(31)</ref>. We have applied a chelator-based method for inducing Cu deficiency in C. reinhardtii cells grown in low but sufficient Cu concentrations (0.3 M). This approach was shown to allow CYC6 gene expression (5). The C. reinhardtii transformants that had been cultivated under these conditions indeed experienced a Cu deficiency, as shown by the accumulation of the Cyc6 protein in several selected strains <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2c, inset)</ref>. After the copper-depleted state of the C. reinhardtii transformants had been proven, they were analyzed by the luciferase activity assay. Again, only transformants carrying the constructs CL24 and CL27 exhibited luciferase activity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2c</ref>), while C. reinhardtii strains transformed with the constructs CL31, CL36, and CL41 did not.</p><p>To confirm that no CRLUC transcript accumulated in Cudepleted C. reinhardtii transformants of the CL31, CL36, and CL41 libraries, RT-PCR analyses were conducted. RNA isolated from 11 individual strains of each construct library, which had been Cu deprived for 4 days, was tested for the presence of CRLUC and FDX5 transcripts. While strong signals appeared using oligonucleotides specific for FDX5 mRNA, no signals were obtained by using CRLUC-specific primers in strains carrying the constructs CL31, CL36, and CL41 (data not shown).</p><p>The SBP domain of Crr1 binds to the GTAC motifs of the FDX5 promoter.

It was shown previously that the SBP domain of Crr1 binds to the functionally defined (33) CuREs of CPX1 and CYC6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(16)</ref>. We analyzed whether the SBP domain of Crr1 can also bind to the two proximal GTAC motifs within the FDX5 upstream region described above to be essential for FDX5 promoter activity. By using the heterologously produced Crr1 SBP domain, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted with digoxigeninlabeled 36-bp fragments of the FDX5 promoter, including the two proximal GTAC motifs either intact or mutated to ACTG or TAGA <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3a)</ref>. The labeled FDX5 promoter fragments were incubated in the presence or in the absence of 200 ng of a heterologously produced Crr1 SBP domain. No retardation of the fragments could be observed in the absence of the SBP domain <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3b, lanes 1 to 4)</ref>. However, the incubation of a fragment of the putative FDX5 promoter including the two proximal (positions Ϫ96 and Ϫ74) GTAC motifs (construct I) ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a)</ref> with the Crr1 SPB domain resulted in two shifted bands of the digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotides <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3b,  lane 5)</ref>. The fragments carrying only one intact GTAC site (constructs II and III) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3a)</ref> showed a single band shift, independently of which of the two GTAC motifs was present <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3b, lanes 6 and 7)</ref>. The mutation of both GTAC motifs (construct IV) ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a)</ref> prevented the retardation of the fragment <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3b, lane 8)</ref>.</p><p>The specificity of the binding of the Crr1 SBP domain to the FDX5 promoter fragments was verified by incubating the SBP domain with constant amounts (60 fmol) of labeled FDX5 construct II <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3a)</ref> and increasing amounts (0 fmol to 6,000 fmol) of unlabeled fragment (construct II or IV) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3a)</ref>. The strength of the shifted band decreased with increasing amounts of unlabeled construct II but not in the presence of unlabeled construct IV, which carries both mutations <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3c)</ref>.</p><p>FDX5 gene expression is absent in a Crr1-deficient C. reinhardtii strain. The fact that the expression of the FDX5 gene is induced by anaerobiosis, Cu deficiency, and the addition of Ni <ref type="bibr">(13, 39;</ref> this study) and the requirement for intact GTAC sites for the activity of the FDX5 promoter, as shown above, strongly indicate that the FDX5 gene is a target of the Crr1 transcriptional activator. To confirm this hypothesis, FDX5 expression was analyzed in O -or Cu-deficient cultures of a crr1 mutant strain (CC-3960) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(16)</ref>. C. reinhardtii strain CC-425 served as the control strain.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The expression of the FDX5 gene of C. reinhardtii has been shown to be strongly upregulated under anaerobic conditions, either in dark-adapted and N 2 -flushed cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39)</ref> or in illuminated, sulfur-deprived cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(13)</ref>. FDX5 transcripts also accumulate significantly in Cu-limited cultures (39; this study). The transcription of several genes is activated by both O 2 and Cu deprivation in C. reinhardtii <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34)</ref>, and this dual response is mediated by one transcriptional factor, called Crr1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34)</ref>. Crr1 has been identified to be a SBP domain protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(16)</ref>, and the recombinant Crr1 SBP domain is able to bind GTAC motifs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16)</ref>.</p><p>In the upstream regions of CYC6, CPX1, CRD1, and CTR1, one or more GTAC motifs have been detected, and their influence on gene expression was analyzed by using reporter gene assays. The GTAC motif was shown to be the core of copper response elements (CuREs), and in the case of the CPX1 gene, it was also proven that GTAC is a hypoxia response element (HyRE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34)</ref>.</p><p>In view of the accumulation of the FDX5 transcript under both hypoxic and Cu-deficient conditions, a regulation of the FDX5 gene similar to that of the reported genes mentioned above was compelling. In silico analyses of the region at positions Ϫ300 to ϩ1 relative to the transcription start site of the putative FDX5 promoter indeed showed the presence of three GTAC sites at positions Ϫ116, Ϫ96, and Ϫ74 relative to the transcriptional start point of the FDX5 gene.</p><p>Using the Renilla luciferase-encoding gene CRLUC as a reporter gene (6), we were able to show that a fragment of the putative FDX5 promoter involving bases Ϫ146 to ϩ100 relative to the transcriptional start point (construct CL24) was able to activate the expression of the luciferase-encoding gene in response to anaerobiosis or to Cu deficiency. The successive truncation of this promoter region revealed the two proximal GTAC sites at positions Ϫ96 and Ϫ74 to be necessary and sufficient for conferring Cu and hypoxia responsiveness to the expression of CRLUC. Various mutations of one or both of these two critical GTAC sites showed that both sites have to be present in their wild-type sequence to allow the FDX5 promoter to be active and that the distal GTAC site cannot replace the proximal motif (CL41).</p><p>Comparing these results with available literature, the Cu response of FDX5 resembles that of the CRD1 gene (1). Besides FDX5, this is the only Crr1 target reported so far to depend on two GTAC sites for transcriptional activation under conditions of Cu deficiency (1) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>. In both the CPX1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(33)</ref> and CTR1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(30)</ref> promoters, one single GTAC motif has been shown to be the CuRE. The CYC6 promoter contains two Cu-responsive GTAC sites, which, however, are both able to confer Cu responsiveness independently <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(33)</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the response to hypoxia, only the GTAC sites of </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIG. 5. Schematic comparison of the promoter regions of several</head><p>Crr1 target genes. Sequences were derived from the original research articles (CYC6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>, CPX1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>, CTR1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>, and CRD1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) and from the Augustus 5 gene model annotated in the C. reinhardtii genome sequence in JGI 4.0 for FDX5: au5.g7064_t1 (transcription start site 14 bp upstream at position chromosome_17:702568 in JGI 4.0 [identified in this work]). Positions of GTAC sites are indicated as squares and triangles and numbered relative to the transcription start site at position ϩ1. In the case of CPX1, the transcription start point of the longest transcript described previously by Quinn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(32)</ref> was chosen. Black symbols indicate that a function of the respective GTAC motif as a CuRE (black squares) or HyRE (black triangles) was proven, gray symbols represent GTAC sites which were shown to have no function, and white symbols stand for GTAC sequences that have not been analyzed regarding their function. The asterisks above the CuRE symbols in the CYC6 scheme indicate that both sites are able to confer Cu responsiveness individually. the CPX1 promoter have been analyzed in detail. In contrast to the Cu response, a single CuRE is not sufficient for an enhanced expression of a reporter gene under hypoxic conditions. Rather, the CuRE and a second GTAC motif, referred to as the HyRE, have to be present in the promoter region to allow hypoxia-responsive expression of the reporter gene (34) <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>.</p><p>Thus, regarding the transcriptional activation of the FDX5 gene as a response to hypoxia, the FDX5 promoter is similar to the promoter of the CPX1 gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(34)</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Fig. 5)</ref>.</p><p>It is noteworthy that while both proximal GTAC sites of the FDX5 promoter are necessary to induce gene transcription in vivo, the SBP domain of Crr1 is able to bind to both GTAC sites of the FDX5 promoter individually, as shown by a clear band shift of all constructs of the respective region that contain at least one wild-type GTAC motif. Obviously, the fact that Crr1 is able to bind to one GTAC site via its SBP domain is not sufficient to confer transcriptional activation in vivo.</p><p>It has been suggested from a detailed mutational analysis of the CYC6 promoter that additional nucleotides in the CYC6 promoter are important for the proper expression of a reporter gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(33)</ref>. Again, this indicates that the binding of the SBP domain to a GTAC core alone is not sufficient to activate transcription properly. The appearance of a double-shift band in EMSAs using the wild-type FDX5 promoter fragment, containing both GTAC sites, might hint at a double binding of the SBP domain to sequences containing two GTAC motifs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(27)</ref>. Extrapolating this hypothesis to the in vivo background of living C. reinhardtii cells, this might indicate that two SBP domain proteins are necessary to activate the transcription of the FDX5 gene. This has to be analyzed in more detail in the future, also taking into account additional domains of the responsible transcriptional activator that influence the binding and/or dimerization capacity of the factor.</p><p>The fact that the Crr1 SBP domain binds to the GTAC sites of the putative FDX5 promoter is still no ultimate evidence for FDX5 being regulated by the Crr1 transcriptional activator. Several SBP domains have been shown to bind to GTAC motifs, and the SBP domain of Crr1 also binds an Arabidopsis thaliana promoter fragment, including a GTAC site, while on the other hand, a C. reinhardtii CYC6 promoter fragment can be retarded by SBP domains from Arabidopsis and Physcomitrella <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. At least seven genes that putatively encode SBP domain proteins have been detected in the C. reinhardtii genomic sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref>. However, the hypothesis that the FDX5 gene is under the transcriptional control of the Crr1 protein was confirmed by the fact that a C. reinhardtii crr1 mutant strain does not show any detectable accumulation of FDX5 transcripts or the Fdx5 protein. Thus, FDX5 is clearly regulated by Crr1 in response to Cu and O limitation.</p><p>It remains a matter of debate as to why the two environmental conditions of Cu and O deficiencies are sensed and signaled by the same pathway. Cu is less soluble and bioavailable under anaerobic conditions, so the evolution of one signaling pathway to react to these two coupled conditions might make physiological sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3)</ref>. The proteins encoded by the known Cu-and hypoxia-responsive genes have specific functions in Cu or in O 2 deficiency but not always obviously in both. While the role of the Cyc6 protein is evident in Cu-depleted C. reinhardtii cells, where it replaces the Cu protein plastocyanin <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(20)</ref>, a role of Cyc6 under anaerobic conditions is not known. The same is true for copper transporters like Ctr1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(30)</ref>. Cpx1 is involved in heme biosynthesis, which might be enhanced to provide a sufficient amount of heme as the cofactor of Cyc6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>. On the other hand, the enhanced expression of the CPX1 and CRD1 genes under hypoxic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34)</ref> might be an attempt to scavenge O 2 molecules, since both encoded enzymes are O 2 dependent.</p><p>Ferredoxins are small soluble electron carriers like cytochrome c 6 , and there are manifold pathways that involve electron transfer reactions mediated by ferredoxins. Some of these are O 2 dependent, such as fatty acid desaturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(36)</ref>, which might provide a link to the O 2 responsiveness of a ferredoxinencoding gene.</p><p>C. reinhardtii has at least six ferredoxin-encoding genes, which are differentially expressed under various environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39)</ref>. Interestingly, the putative promoter regions of PETF, FDX2, FDX4, and FDX6 each contain one GTAC motif as well. However, FDX5 is the only gene whose transcript strongly and significantly accumulates upon treatments known to elicit Crr1-dependent responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39)</ref>. Obviously, the small electron carrier ferredoxin 5 has a specific role in anaerobic and/or Cu-deficient C. reinhardtii cells, which, however, remains to be elucidated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>RT-PCR analyses of FDX5 transcript abundance and schematic diagrams of reporter gene constructs generated in this study.(a) RT-PCR analyses using mRNA isolated from C. reinhardtii strain CC-125 cultures flushed with N in the dark (O , Ϫ), S-deprived cells (S, Ϫ), and Cu-deficient algae (Cu, Ϫ). mRNA from cultures grown in TAP medium in the light served as controls (each ϩ).

			<abstract>
				<p>The nanosized (∼10 nm in 0.01 M PBS and 210 nm in water) star-shaped polymethacrylates with various content of pendant carboxyl groups were characterized via basic physicochemical and biological properties toward their use as drug carriers for intravenous administration. The carboxyl groups in polymer were employed to conjugate fluorescein (FA) or doxorubicin (DOX) via amide bond formation. In case of DOX, the conjugation efficiency was higher (4.0-16.0%) than of FA conjugation (1.5-4.5%) for corresponding copolymers. The solubility of conjugates strongly depended on the type of attached compound, that is free carriers and their FA conjugates were water-soluble, whereas DOX conjugates were insoluble in water. Cytotoxicity tests performed on model fibroblast and epithelial cell lines showed that negatively charged copolymers (ZP ranged from −75 to −25 mV) were slightly toxic for normal cells (NHDF) and non-toxic for cancer cell lines (HCT-116 and MCF-7/ R). The copolymer dose equal to 125 μg/mL resulted in cell viability 118% towards NHDF and 90% for HCT116 cells. The internalization of a representative polymer-fluorescein conjugate by HCT-116 and its accumulation in cytoplasm was proven via fluorescence microscopy. MMA/MAA stars showed no adverse effect on HCT-116 cells, hence fluorescein-tagged polymers might be applied as fluorescence probes for in vitro imaging, whereas doxorubicin-tagged polymers might be developed as a new polymeric drug carriers.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The macromolecules as drug carriers are designed in respect to the biocompatibility, non-toxicity, non-immunogenicity and lack of accumulation in the body. Poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) is well known from its pH-responsiveness, therefore the conformation and solubility of polymeric chains containing MAA units can be triggered by pH of aqueous media. There is a high probability that the various pH conditions in different tissues and cellular compartments influence on the interactions and self-assembly behavior of the pH-sensitive polymeric systems. Thus, besides size, the surface charge is the most important physicochemical factor affecting DDS in terms of their function in the drug delivery. Generally, the charged particles are taken up by cells better than their uncharged counterparts. It was proven that cells ingest positively charged poly(lactic acid) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Honary and Zahir, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Pillai et al., 2015)</ref>, chitosan <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Yue et al., 2011)</ref> and polystyrene <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Jiang et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Jiang et al., , 2011</ref> particles in a greater degree than the respective anionic ones. Although positive charge appears to improve the efficacy of drug delivery, a higher cytotoxicity of such nanocarriers has been reported (Capco and Yongsheng, 2014).</p><p>The polymeric drug delivery systems (DDS) are often investigated in cooperation with fluorescent organic dyes to monitor the transport pathway by fluorescence microscopy, what can help to improve the effectiveness of delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ding et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Wu and Chiu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sun et al., 2012)</ref>. Most of the organic dyes such as fluoresceins, positively charged rhodamines, and cyanines are not used in vivo because of their relatively quick photobleaching, which can damage cells and cause substantial cytotoxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Han and Burgess, 2009)</ref>. The same problem concerns fluorescent proteins which additionally suffer from low quantum yield as much as aggregation inside cells causing cellular toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mauring et al., 2007)</ref>. Water-soluble semiconducting polymers have demonstrated high sensitivity as biosensors and chemical sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Wu et al., 2010)</ref>. Up till now, these polymers are not degradable and usually contain conjugated phenyl units, which provide poor solubility in water and promote potential carcinogenesis or toxicity in the cases of in vivo biomedical applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Tang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berezin and Achilefu, 2010)</ref>. Recently, the fluorescently labeled carbon nano-onions, obtained by a reaction involving the amide bond formation between fluoresceinamine (FA) and the carboxylic groups on the surface, have been applied for in vitro imaging of HeLa cells, demonstrating high emission properties without significant cytotoxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Frasconi et al., 2015)</ref>. Non-toxicity for HeLa cells was also indicated by the fluorescent labeled Wells-Dawson type polyoxometalates with Sn-organyl derivatives carrying a carboxyl group conjugated with fluoresceinamine, which appeared as randomly dispersed over the entire cytoplasm, or were aggregated in clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Geisberger et al., 2013)</ref>. Another example for alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate microcapsules labeled with fluoresceinamine were investigated to show the difference in alginate distribution in the Ca-alginate gel beads <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Strand et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we report the results of preliminary studies on biological properties (cytotoxicity, cellular internalization) of watersoluble star-shape polymethacrylates with salicin core and fluorescently decorated arms as the carriers of FA or DOX. The effect of free carriers, including their sizes and zeta potentials in water/PBS media, on healthy cell line (normal human fibroblast -NHDF) and cancerous cell lines (colon carcinoma -HCT116 as well as breast adenocarcinoma resistant for doxorubicin -MCF-7/R) have been evaluated by means of cytotoxicity assays (MTS and apoptosis assays). The internalization of FAfunctionalized copolymers by NHDF as well as HCT116 cells was proved by fluorescence microscopy. We have also described the preparation of DOX-star conjugates via amide bonding as the polymeric prodrugs and their general characterization. Unfortunately, the latter conjugates were insoluble in water or phosphate saline buffer (PBS) what disenabled carrying out biological experiments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and discussion</head><p>3.1. Behavior of MMA/MAA star-shaped copolymers in water and PBS solution: influence of ionic strength on size and zeta potential</p><p>In deionized water, the hydrodynamic diameter (D h ) of polymeric particles was slightly above 200 nm <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, which suggested that, neither quantity of methacrylic acid repeating units nor length of arms influence the size of polymer aggregates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs. 1 and S1</ref>). Despite the fact that star-shaped P(MMA-co-MAA) are weak acids, the accumulation of negative charges on polymethacrylic arms takes place, due to dissociation of eCOOH groups. As the result of the Coulomb interac-tions between negatively charged arms, the conformation of macromolecules is changed providing formation of complex superstructures. Significantly smaller particles with sizes ∼10 nm were obtained in PBS solution, which osmolality and ion concentration resemble human body fluids. Such behavior is explained by the higher ionic strength of the solutions arising from the presence of salts, which leads to negative charge shielding. These results for the star-shaped P(MMA-co-MAA)s are promising, owing to the fact that particles smaller than 100 nm remain in blood vessels within fenestrae of the endothelial lining, improving permeation and retention effect (EPR) of polymers. Typical size distribution graphs and D h as a function of the number of MAA repeating units per macromolecule (DP MAA ) or one arm (DP MAA,arm ) in both media are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b</ref> and c.</p><p>The zeta potential (ZP) measurements of polymers were performed in deionized water or 0.01 M PBS to display the effect of ionic strength on the value of the charge placed in the so-called slip plane between the Stern layer and the diffusion layer, which form electrical double layer around particles. It is known that zeta potential is not the surface charge of particles, however its magnitude gives an indication of the Scheme 1. Synthesis of FA and DOX conjugates with star-shaped polymethacrylates containing salicin core. potential stability of the colloidal system. As it was expected, the ZP values of the studied polyanions were negative <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1,</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2)</ref>.</p><p>In deionized water the ZP values increased linearly with increasing number of MAA repeating units. Therefore, in the studied star-shaped copolymers, the DP MAA was revealed as an important parameter available for simple tuning of macromolecule properties in aqueous solutions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. Additionally, the ZP values of polymeric particles in deionized water were lower than in 0.01 M PBS solutions. For instance, the ZP of SPAc1 in deionized water has reached −74 mV at 25.0°C and −65 mV at 36.6°C, whereas in PBS at both temperatures the ZP values were approximately −20 mV. Similar tendency was also observed for the 6-arm copolymers. However, in the case of SPAc4 with the largest  number of MAA units, the most evident influence of temperature on ZP in both media (differences of 20 mV in water and 8 mV in PBS) was detected. Generally, it has been known that the increase in temperature leads to the increase in mobility of particles and ZP is directly proportional to the electrophoretic mobility of particles (negative as well as positive values). Hence, electrostatic repulsions between the particles should effectively prevent flocculation giving more stable solution. In the studied copolymers the decrease of ZP was caused probably by the intra-and intermolecular interactions between the macromolecules which have triggered the formation of aggregates with lower velocity of the Brownian motion than single macromolecules. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Fluorescence microscopy images of the cellular uptake and accumulation of SPAc3 FA in HCT-116 cells (10 × 10 3 cells/well). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Fluorescence microscopy and CLSM</head><p>The pendant carboxyl groups in the star-shape MMA/MAA copolymers with acetal derivative of D(−)salicin in the core were used to conjugate FA by condensation reaction via amide bonds formation . The fluorescent properties of FAstar conjugates were employed to monitor the cell uptake and track localization of the model 6-arm copolymer (SPAc3 FA ) in cell cultures by means of fluorescence and confocal laser microscopy. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> shows representative fluorescence images which were taken after 24 and 48 h of incubation of HCT-116 cells with the fluorescent polymer. After 24 h the polymer was accumulated mostly in the outer region of cytoplasm. Dots with stronger fluorescence signal are probably derived from cells that are superimposed on each other while black holes depict regions where nuclei are located. After 48 h the cancer cells tended to form colonies. Furthermore, constant penetration and accumulation of polymer particles in cells caused the increase in fluorescence intensity.</p><p>Finally, the observations were also made with the use of sequential scan mode of CLSM, so that a series of received images recreated the three-dimensional structure of the cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figs. and S2)</ref>. The images have proven that polymer is found in the entire volume of cytoplasm.</p><p>Referring to the previously published research, it was found that the signal received for the SPAc3 FA was weaker in comparison with positively charged particles formed by the analogical polybases . This might be caused by the relatively low number of fluorescein molecules attached to SPAc3 (n FA = 3 per macromolecule) as well as the lower efficiency of internalization of negatively charged polymers by the cells. The latter case is related to the fact that the cell membrane has on its surface negatively charged compounds, i.e. phosphatidylserine or glycosylated mucin, which could repeal particles with the same surface charge by electrostatic interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Riedl et al., 2011)</ref>. In consequence, the negatively charged SPAc3 FA was internalized slower than the analogical copolymer with amino alcohol groups .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Toxicity tests for star polymers</head><p>As it was previously reported, the interactions of various carriers containing PMAA blocks with different types of cells, e.g. HeLa <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Yang et al., 2014)</ref>, HEK 293T <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Jin et al., 2015)</ref>, COS7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Qi et al., 2015)</ref>, HepG2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Qi et al., 2015)</ref>, A549 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Qi et al., 2015)</ref> revealed no toxicity even at very high concentration (up to 200 mg/mL) and prolonged incubation time.</p><p>In our studies, the first cytotoxicity assessment was based on MTS test conducted on normal human fibroblasts (NHDF) treated with SPAc3 and its conjugate with FA in the concentration range 0.005-5.000 μg/mL <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5a)</ref>. Simultaneously, the influence of SPAc3 on colon cancer cell line HCT-116 was also investigated. The results showed slight cytotoxicity of SPAc3 and its fluorescent derivative on NHDF cells, even though SPAc3 FA was less toxic (average cell viability ∼85%) than SPAc3 (average cell viability ∼80%). In most cases, the obtained data were statistically significant comparing to the control. However, the HCT-16 cells demonstrated no decrease in cell proliferation and the effect of SPAc3 was statistically nonsignificant. Consequently, the experiments with a higher concentration of SPAc3 carrier (12.5-250 μg/mL) were performed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5b)</ref> verifying almost the same behavior, that is no changes in HCT-116 cells in all range, and viability of NHDF cells at the level of ∼75% in the range up to 50 μg/mL. The latter ones indicated a drastic increase of proliferation rate at doses equal to 75.0 and 125 μg/mL (123% and 118%, respectively). The results are in contrary to those obtained for 4-arm copolymer bearing amine groups (52 mol%) which showed inhibition of HCT-116 cells proliferation up to 58% (at polymer concentration 125 μg/mL) and low cytotoxicity toward NHDF cells (cell proliferation in the range 81-108%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mielańczyk et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Since SPAc3 did not adversely affect colon cancer cells in a wide range of concentrations, it is expected that the results of toxicity tests conducted with a polymer bearing the drug in its matrix should be free from the influence of the polymer itself on the cell line. At the same time, low cytotoxicity to normal cells demonstrated by SPAc3 at lower doses, suggests a different way of interaction between normal cells and polymer vs colon cancer cells and polymer. It is possible that the difference comes from the environment surrounding cells. Cancer cells differ from normal cells not only with their structure but also metabolites that are generated and excreted to the medium. One of the products of cancer cell metabolism is lactic acid, which yields reduced pH value (the range of pH is 2-5) and might interact with carboxylic groups along polymeric arms. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5c</ref> presents MTS test results for doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/R) treated with all star-shaped MMA/MAA copolymers. This model of cells was especially interesting in relation to our earlier studies conducted on polymers with pendant amine groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mielańczyk et al., 2016)</ref>. The statistically significant cytotoxicity was determined in two cases, that is SPAc3 and SPAc4 at the lowest dose of 12.5 μg/mL. Next, the cell proliferation gradually increased reaching maximum values of 130-170% (at polymer dose equal to 75.0 μg/mL) and then decreased to 97-135%. According to the literature data for the interactions of chitosan/PMAA and Fe O 4 /chitosan/PMAA nanoparticles solutions (at concentrations between 200 and 2000 μg/mL) with breast cancer cell lines, i.e. MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231, the cell viability remained in the range of 90-120% <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Zarouni et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast to that, PMAA hollow microspheres with Ag or/and Fe 3 O 4 on their surface affected MCF-7 cells with an increase of concentration (1-100 μg/mL) or in the presence of magnetic field (at concentration equal 5 and 10 μg/mL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chatzipavlidis et al., 2013)</ref>. In our previous studies, it has been shown that MCF-7/R line treated with series of copolymers with different amine group contents (31-77 mol%) exhibited the hormeticlike response of cells at polymer concentrations between 12.5-500 μg/ mL <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mielańczyk et al., 2016)</ref>. Although, the results of MTS assay are based on mitochondrial activity, in this case they have been interpreted as a cell proliferation since it has been reported that neither PMAA nor (meth)acrylic acid influence on dehydrogenase enzyme activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ferdinandusse et al., 2015)</ref>. Nonetheless, the cytotoxicity results obtained via MTS assay are highly encouraging. The lack of cytotoxicity effect of SPAc3 on colon cancer cell line was confirmed by apoptosis assay. The results shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> suggest that either polymer nor polymer-fluorescein conjugate had a negative impact on HCT-116. Although, after 24 h there was a small increase in an apoptotic cells population level in comparison to 1 h ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 6a and  b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Synthesis and characterization of polymer-DOX prodrug</head><p>In our previous studies, the pendant carboxyl groups of star-shaped MMA/MAA copolymers were used to conjugate FA via a condensation reaction with formation of amide bonds to generate fluorescent properties of star copolymers. Since amide bond is proteolytically cleavable we have used the same type of reaction in order to attach DOX molecules. The efficacy of DOX conjugation was apparently higher than in the case of reaction with FA ) (0.5-4.5% vs 4.0-16.0%, respectively). These results might be explained by the amine reactivity (aliphatic amines are more reactive than aromatic ones) as well as better solubility of DOX than FA in water.</p><p>The number of conjugated DOX molecules was calculated from the calibration curve (made for DOX) using absorbance peak with a maximum at λ = 490 nm in the UV-vis spectrum of each conjugate. Comparing the four-and six-arm copolymers with a similar content of MAA units, it can be seen that the reaction efficiency was higher in the latter case (SPAc2 DOX vs SPAc4 DOX = 11% vs 16% and SPAc1 DOX vs SPAc3 DOX = 4% vs 7%). The results indicate that the amount of attached DOX increases with the number of the arms as well as the content of acidic units ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). The maximum quantities of DOX molecules conjugated via amide bond reported in the literature for other types of polymers were comparable, i.e. 11-14 mol% (i.e. ∼2 DOX molecules per each macromolecule on average) in the case of poly (ethylene oxide)-block-poly(α-carboxyl-ε-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCCL- <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.

Comparing 1 H NMR spectra <ref type="figure">(Fig. S3</ref>) for six-arm P(MMA-co-MAA) and its derivative with attached DOX, the intensity of proton signals assigned to carboxyl groups (eCOOH, 11.9-12.9 ppm) significantly decreased after conjugation, whereas new signals appeared with a chemical shifts corresponding to DOX protons. The singlet peak assigned to the protons of methyl group in the amino sugar units (eCH 3 , 1.24 ppm) was partially overlapped with the signals of eCH 3 groups in the backbone of polymethacrylate arms. Moreover, the conjugation of DOX caused broadening of methylene (&gt; CH 2 , 1.50-2.35 ppm) and methyl (eCH 3 , 0.50-1.25 ppm) groups signals due to the vicinity of a bulky substituent to the main chain. The broad signal in the range 2.05-2.35 ppm (eCH 2 e in backbone), was overlapped with some proton signals from DOX and most probably depicted shift of eCH 2 CHCONHe protons. Next, signal at 3.15 ppm stayed within the characteristic range of vicinal protons neighboring with the amide moiety and was assigned to the protons from newly formed methine group &gt; CHNHCOe in aglycone (3.99 ppm). The appearance of new signals with a broad basis at 8.24, 7.92 and 7.66 ppm indicates both the presence of aromatic protons as well as the protons from amide groups eCONHeat similar chemical shift.</p><p>Comparing FT-IR spectra <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S4)</ref> of SPAc2 copolymer and its reaction product with DOX (SPAc2 DOX ), in the latter one the enhanced absorption band corresponding to ν(C]O) in the range of 1725 to 1680 cm −1 was observed, what indicates the overlap of a stretching vibration of carbonyl groups from the ester units in polymethacrylate and DOX. In contrast, stretching vibration of the amide first mode ν(C] O) at 1650 cm −1 was shifted to the lower wavelength number region due to the structural resonance. The second amide mode which refers to bending δ(NH) vibration appeared at 1530 cm −1 . The strong increase in the intensity of bands in the region 3500-3400 cm −1 indicates the presence of stretching vibrations of eOH from unreacted acidic groups, eOH groups in conjugated DOX units as well as eNH groups characteristic for the secondary amides. <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref> presents SEM images of polymeric conjugates SPAc4 DOX , SPAc2 DOX and SPAc3 DOX in order of decreasing number of attached DOX molecules (n DOX : 13, 7 and 4, respectively). Their morphologies seem to be similar independently from the content of hydrophilic fraction with carboxylic groups as well as the number of arms. They resemble strongly branched, rounded stony corals, but in the case of four-armed stars represented by the sample of SPAc2 DOX the spongylike morphology among tiny beads was clearly distinguished.</p></div>

The latter ones were characterized in aqueous solutions displaying miscellaneous properties depending on medium ionic strength and temperature. In deionized water ZP was correlated strongly with the amount of MAA units in copolymer, whereas in buffer solution the negatively charged macromolecules created significantly smaller particles than in water (∼10 nm vs ∼200 nm). The cell cultures exposed to the solutions of star copolymers showed differential behavior in MTS assay. NHDF cells demonstrated decreased viability in the lower dose range and increased proliferation rate above dosage equal 50 μg/mL. HCT-16 cells showed no decrease in cell proliferation rate and the effect of the copolymer was statistically nonsignificant. The star-shaped polyacids exhibited the strongest impact on MCF-7/R cells since proliferation rate reached the highest values, with regard to the control. The result of apoptosis assay confirmed lack of negative impact of copolymers on colon cancer cell line by showing almost negligible number of necrotic cells in population. The cellular internalization of copolymers, confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, is promising from the perspective of future application as nanocarriers in drug delivery.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Representative DLS histograms for SPAc1 in 0.01 M PBS (left) and deionized water (right) (a), D h as a function of MAA units per one macromolecule (b), and per one arm (c).</figDesc></figure>

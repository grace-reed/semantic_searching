In the mutualistic symbiosis, corals provide inorganic nutrients and carbon dioxide for the photosynthetic zooxanthellae, while zooxanthellae supply M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT corals with indispensable organic nutrients and oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Muller-Parker et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>However, the intricate coral-zooxanthella symbiosis is sensitive to changes in the environment, and can collapse due to elevated seawater temperatures and environmental pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Schlöder and D'Croz, 2004)</ref>. Therefore, scleractinian corals have experienced frequent and severe degradation over the past decades <ref type="bibr">(Vidal-Dupiol et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Microplastics (particle diameters &lt; 1 mm) are a type of emerging pollutants in marine ecosystems, and have been considered a serious hazard to marine organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ogonowski et al., 2018)</ref>. Microplastics can be ingested by a wide range of marine species ranging from zooplankton to bivalves, crustaceans, and fish, and hence enter into the marine food chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Devriese et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sun et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tanaka and Takada, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen, 2014)</ref>. Because these ingested microplastics are not degradable for most marine organisms, the microplastics can accumulate and cause adverse effects on the organisms through the blockage of alimentary tract <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Wright et al., 2013)</ref>. Microplastics can also form hetero-aggregates with marine phytoplankton and repress their growth, photosynthesis, and sinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Long et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Long et al., 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, marine microplastics are a complex cocktail of polymers, residual monomers, and chemical additives, as they can absorb organic matter and chemical contaminants or have the potential to accumulate bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. Adsorbed chemical substances of small molecular sizes can be transferred directly into the cells and tissues, and have severe toxic effects on the consumer organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Teuten et al., 2009)</ref>. Several chemicals associated with the M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT microplastics function as environmental hormones to activate signal transduction pathways in target tissues, and modulate physiological activities of marine organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Panti et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, it has been reported that microplastics induced oxidative stress and triggered the MAPK/Nrf2 pathway in the marine copepod Paracyclopina nana and rotifer Brachionus koreanus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jeong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jeong et al., 2016)</ref>. Microplastic debris has also been observed in the coral reef ecosystem, and some studies have noted the impact of microplastics on scleractinian corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hall et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Reichert et al., 2018)</ref>. Microplastic pollution has been detected in a few coral reef ecosystems worldwide, such as South China Sea and Great Barrier Reef <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Reisser et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhao et al., 2015)</ref>. There have been limited studies examining the effects of microplastic exposure on corals, although recent studies have shown that microplastic plastics can be ingested in culture experiments of corals such as Dipsastrea pallida and wrapped in mesenterial tissue within the coral gut cavity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hall et al., 2015)</ref>. It has been also reported that the microplastic consumption is driven by chemoreception in Astrangia poculata <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allen et al., 2017)</ref>. Furthermore, different coral species can respond differently to microplastics exposures. For example, it has been reported that Pocillopora damicornis did not ingest, but was attached by, microplastics at tentacles or mesenterial filaments, which could result in coral bleaching and tissue necrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Reichert et al., 2018)</ref>. These studies have revealed potential negative effects of microplastics on scleractinian corals; however, the detailed mechanism underlying the effects is not well understood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>This study used P. damicornis as a model to fill the gap of understanding on detailed mechanisms of microplastic effects on scleractinian corals. P. damicornis belongs to the family Pocilloporidae, and is widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical areas of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. To understand the potential effects of microplastic exposure on symbiosis and physiology of this species, symbiont density and chlorophyll content, crucial enzyme activities, and transcriptomic profiles of the coral were investigated after an acute exposure to microplastics. Our results provide insights into molecular and biochemical level stress response that may precede or underpin physiological stress symptoms caused by microplastic pollution.</p></div>

The branches in the colonies were split as nubbins, and these were attached on the plastic mesh plate located in the bottom of flow-through aquaria (ca. L) filled with natural seawater (26 °C). Cultures were illuminated with white and blue cool fluorescent bulbs (Philips T5HO Activiva Active 54 W) at a light intensity of 518 μmol photons m -2 s -1 in a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle for one month to acclimatize in laboratory conditions.</p></div>

Twenty-five coral nubbins were transferred immediately into the freshly prepared microplastic-containing seawater (3 tanks), which served as the microplastic group.</p><p>Continuous gentle aeration was employed to avoid aggregations of microplastics.</p><p>Another 25 nubbins were placed in tanks containing natural seawater as a control group (3 tanks). Coral nubbins were randomly sampled in the microplastic and control groups after 6, 12, and 24 h of incubation, and the rest of 10 nubbins was randomly sampled at 0 h. For metatranscriptome sequencing, 3 nubbins were sampled from each group after 12 h exposure, and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen. To measure the density and chlorophyll content of the endosymbionts as well as stress-related enzyme activities of the coral, 6 nubbins were sampled from each group after 0, 6, 12 and 24 h.</p></div>

On the contrary, the chlorophyll content of zooxanthellae increased significantly at 12 h after microplastic exposure, compared to that in the control group. This is different from the reports that microplastics had negative effects on chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency of free-living marine microalgae <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Long et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. The inconsistency might be because in our case most of the microplastics attached to the coral <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Reichert et al., 2018)</ref>. The attachment to the coral tissue likely blocked out some of the light that would otherwise reach the endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. Increased chlorophyll content is a common response in algae to reduction of light availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Falkowski, 1980)</ref>. Furthermore, few differentially expressed genes were observed for the symbiotic zooxanthellae after the acute exposure to microplastics, with no GO terms being overrepresented for the differentially expressed genes. Two of the up-regulated genes, persulfide dioxygenase</p></div>

Whether their up-regulation under microplastic exposure indicates heightened capacity to counter the potential cytotoxic effects of the microplastics is worth further exploring in the future. All these results suggest that acute microplastic stress disturbed, but did not disrupt, the symbiosis between zooxanthellae and P. damicornis over a short term, although the down-regulation of 1,3-beta-glucan synthase can potentially cause some change in host pattern recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lin et al. 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Stress response at molecular and biochemical levels, and evidence of immune and detoxification depression in the coral caused by acute microplastic exposure</head><p>Our analysis of the transcriptomes of P. damicornis at 12 h of acute microplastic exposure revealed a total of 134 significantly up-regulated genes and 215 significantly down-regulated coral genes. Further inspection of their GO term enrichment indicated that the significantly up-regulated genes were mainly related to stress response, zymogen granule and JNK signal pathway. The GO term overrepresentation related to stress response has also been observed in P. damicornis subjected to cadmium and ammonium stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Yuan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Zhou et al., 2018a)</ref>, suggesting that the exposure</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>of microplastics might have activated the general stress response mechanism in this scleractinian coral. Meanwhile, the acute microplastic stress seemed to have activated the JNK signal pathway, because 4 GO terms related to this pathway were overrepresented by the significantly up-regulated genes. It has been reported in monogonont rotifer B. koreanus that microplastic stress can activate the JNK signal pathway through protein phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jeong et al., 2016)</ref>. Besides, it is intriguing to note the up-regulation of zymogen, a protected storage of enzymes, which are often precursors of digestive enzymes that need to be activated by other enzymes for their functions. The up-regulation of this gene suggests that the microplastic-exposed coral might respond in producing more of these digestive enzymes for defense while preventing digesting their own cellular components. Furthermore, the overrepresented GO terms for significantly down-regulated genes were mainly related to the EGF-ERK1/2 signal pathway and sterol transport. As both JNK and EGF-ERK1/2 signal pathways showed response at the transcriptional level in the present study, it is possible that microplastics may function as an environmental hormone to modulate various coral physiological activities, for instance through zymogen activation, and basal metabolism in P. damicornis.</p><p>The most crucial physiological processes of stress response are anti-oxidative stress, detoxification and immune response for corals that live in shallow tropical/tropical waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Weis, 2008)</ref>. We monitored several parameters of these processes to shed light on the short-term effects of acute microplastic stress on P. damicornis. SOD and CAT are the main antioxidases in the coral redox system <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Levy et al., 2006)</ref>, and their M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT significant increase in the microplastic-exposed group at some point of the microplastic exposure suggests that the acute microplastic stress could transiently induce the antioxidant capacity of P. damicornis. Similar transient changes of antioxidase activities were also observed in other corals suffering from environmental stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Levy et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Soriano-Santiago et al., 2013)</ref>. In turn, these results suggest elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during microplastic stress, because the elevated ROS level resulting from a high temperature, air exposure or other stress conditions has been shown to induce the antioxidase gene expressions and activities in scleractinian corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Levy et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Teixeira et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Yakovleva et al., 2004)</ref>. Furthermore, this is consistent with our transcriptomic results showing that the exposure of microplastics activated stress response in P. damicornis. Because excessive oxidative stress is considered the main inducer of the collapse of coral-zooxanthella symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Downs et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lesser, 1997)</ref>, the increase of SOD and CAT activities would be important for maintaining the stability of the symbiosis after acute microplastic stress.</p><p>As a crucial phase II metabolic enzymes in the detoxification process of all eukaryotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Nicosia et al., 2014)</ref>, GST activity was also determined over the course of microplastic exposure. It was observed that the GST activity decreased significantly at 24 h after the exposure, suggesting that acute microplastic exposure could repress the detoxification system in P. damicornis. The decline of GST activity might have been mediated through the JNK and ERK signal pathways discussed earlier, since the modulation of the phase II detoxification enzyme expression by JNK and ERK</p></div>

Microplastics can carry chemicals of small molecular sizes, such as hydrophobic chemicals and additives, which can penetrate into cells and cause severe toxic effects on organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Teuten et al., 2009)</ref>. Therefore, the suppression of the detoxification system owing to the decline of GST activity might increase the toxic effects of any attached chemicals on P. damicornis exposed to microplastics.</p><p>The immune system is a host defense system responsible for the recognition and clearance of pathogenic organisms or materials. The immune function of PO and AKP had been demonstrated in scleractinian corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Godinot et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Palmer et al., 2011)</ref>, and therefore the activities of PO and AKP were also investigated under acute microplastic exposure. The PO activities did not change significantly, while the AKP activities underwent significant decreases suggesting that microplastic-induced stress might compromise the immune system in P. damicornis, possibly through the regulation of JNK and ERK signal pathways. The immune system of scleractinian corals defends against pathogenic organisms and the stabilization of symbiotic zooxanthellae <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Palmer et al., 2010)</ref>. The suppression of the immune system could increase the susceptibility of scleractinian corals to pathogenic microorganisms and bleaching, because the infection of pathogenic microorganisms such as Vibrio coralliilyticus could result in the expulsion of symbiotic zooxanthellae and the bleaching of the scleractinian coral P. damicornis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ben-Haim et al., 2003)</ref>. These</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT</head><p>results collectively suggest that short-term exposure to high concentrations of microplastics can trigger a stress response in the coral host, and regulate the JNK and ERK signal pathways to repress the detoxification and immune system. Short-term exposure to high concentrations of microplastics has the potential to cause negative effects on the health of coral-zooxanthella symbiont in the scleractinian coral P. damicornis even though it did not seem to cause significant stress in the zooxanthellae and collapse of the coral-zooxanthella symbiosis.</p><p>In the present study, 50 mg L -1 microplastics was employed to treat the coral, which was within the range of those used in other reports on scleractinian corals (24-395 mg L -1 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hall et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Reichert et al., 2018)</ref>. However, the concentration was equivalent to an abundance of 9.0 × 10 10 particles L -1 , substantially higher than that observed in natural scenarios (e.g. 8 particles L -1 in Swedish sea area <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Auta et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Wright et al., 2013</ref>). The effective microplastic particle still needs to be further determined through attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kroon et al., 2018)</ref>; however, the concentration used in the present study was still markedly higher than that in natural coral reefs. The high particle abundance of microplastics was employed in the acute exposure to ensure measurable cytological, physiological and transcriptomic responses of both the coral and the endosymbiont. The obtained results suggest that acute exposure to high concentrations of microplastics can activate the stress response of the scleractinian coral P. damicornis, and repress its detoxification and immune system through the JNK and ERK signal pathways, despite the minimal impact on the abundance and M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT major photosynthate translocation transporters of the symbiont in the short term.</p><p>Based on our result, it is apparent that short-term exposure to realistic concentrations of microplastics in the ocean will unlikely cause breakdown of symbiosis between P. damicornis and its algal endosymbionts. However, long-term exposure to lower concentrations still needs to be investigated. Besides, effects of the acute exposure on other coral species also remain to be examined.

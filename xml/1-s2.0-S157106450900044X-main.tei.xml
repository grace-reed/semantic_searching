				<p>This review will examine the evolution of immune mechanisms by emphasizing information from animal groups exclusive of all vertebrates. There will be a focus on concepts that propelled the immune system into prominent discourse in the life sciences. The self/not self hypothesis was crucial and so was the concern for immunologic memory or anamnesia, development of cancer, autoimmunity, and clonal selection. Now we may be able to deconstruct clonal selection since it is not applicable in the sense that it is not applicable to invertebrate mechanisms. Clonal selection seems to be purely as all evidence indicates a vertebrate strategy and therefore irrelevant to invertebrates. Some views may insist that anthropocentric mammalian immunologists utilized a tool to propel: the universal innate immune system of ubiquitous and plentiful invertebrates as an essential system for vertebrates. This was advantageous for all immunology; moreover innate immunity acquired an extended raison d&apos;Ãªtre. Innate immunity should help if there would be a failure of the adaptive immune system. Still to be answered are questions concerning immunologic surveillance that includes clonal selection. We can then ask does immunologic surveillance play a role in the survival of invertebrates that most universally seem to not develop cancer of vertebrates especially mammals; invertebrates only develop benign tumor. A recent proposal concerns an alternative explanation that is all embracing. Danger hypothesis operates in striking contrast to the self/not self hypothesis. This view holds that the immune system is adapted to intervene not because self is threatened but because of the system&apos;s sense of danger. This perception occurs by means of signals other than recognition of microbial pattern recognition molecules characteristic of invertebrates. Response to danger may be another way of analyzing innate immunity that does not trigger the production of clones and therefore does not rely entirely on the self/not self model. The review will end with certain perspectives on artificial immune systems new on the scene and the product of computational immunologists. The tentative view is to question if the immune systems of invertebrates might be amenable to such an analysis? This would offer more credence to the innate system, often pushed aside thus favoring the adaptive responses.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>When we think about or hear the immune system, our first reaction in the minds of most people (immunologists; non-immunologists) is to think that the immune system only helps humans and protects them from infection that may include viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. This is only partially true for several reasons. First, our immune system rarely acts alone but functions in association with the other two linked regulating systems (the nervous and endocrine systems; not to be examined in this review). Second, when we examine the immune systems close up, there are several generalizations that emerge. The immune system is ubiquitous, found in all creatures including plants and is therefore not restricted to humans <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[13]</ref>. Every living being possesses an immune system and this is not to exclude the ubiquitous viruses that also struggle for survival by a kind of protection akin to an immune system, functioning appropriately for their level of evolution. Third, beginning with single cells including the onecelled amoeba and at every animal "lower" levels of evolution, we can see mechanisms that ensure their survival: Moving further, the immune system, if carefully traced stepwise during evolution treating extremely limited fossil forms, reveals progressively more complex development after we critically examine various levels of plant and animal evolution.</p><p>This aspect of analyzing immune systems concerns a greater emphasis and preoccupation with the human immune system. As a result much of the fascination of sequential development is excluded. Thus only in rare instances as will be revealed in this section do a few comparative immunologists focus on certain representative animal groups. This approach reveals a myriad of intriguing adaptations that in the end help to clarify what may have happened as the human immune system developed during evolution. Simply stated, levels of biological evolution reveal concomitant tiers of immune complexity during evolution of immune responses. A prime example concerns the unicellular amoeba. Because of its essential structure, the nature of its form must combine, perforce, all functions essential for life into one structure, the single cell. The amoebas' act of phagocytosis is both a food getting apparatus and a unicellular immune response! So then what remains in higher animals, including humans? The human phagocytes of various kinds owe their phylogenesis and ontogenesis to the amoeba. Every available space in the body is guarded by a phagocyte whose location carries unique names, e.g. macrophages, neutrophils, antigen presenting cells, and even the microglia found in the brain; this ensures an enormous immuno-physiological network that serves as this ubiquitous linkage between the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems. The immune system is one example that reveals levels of organization and complexity. These systems mirror the organization, components and functionally diverse strategies that provide ubiquitous surveillance that ensures survival.</p><p>Perlovsky poses a pervasive and difficult question that challenges the utility of the immune system in relation to survival "Why deadly diseases exist from an evolutionary viewpoint? Some diseases, e.g. Influenza are clear; the disease agents are multiplying inside the host. But why cancer exists? The host dies and cancer agents (if they exist) die with the host. It may be a malfunction of the organism"? <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. Here are possible responses. One of the prevailing views concerning the evolutionary pressures that gave rise to the immune system centers around immunologic surveillance as proposed by Burnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[15]</ref>. According to this view, host animals are exposed to pathogenic organisms from the exterior and the immune systems evolve to protect against these harmful intruders. Yet we all know that there are microorganisms that live within us and seem to play no role in spreading a particular disease or killing us. Then, according to the surveillance view, there are some other explanations for evolution of immune systems. According to surveillance, cancer poses an internal threat, in which cells no longer become recognizable as self (self/not self model) and therefore become cancerous and out of control. In this instance, the driving force for evolution of the immune system could be to effectively keep potentially cancerous cells in check, not allowing their uncontrolled metastases.</p><p>Still, we are faced with the monumental problem of understanding innate vs. adaptive immunity. Why? On the one hand, there are millions of invertebrate animals that are known to not develop cancer, but they are vulnerable to pathogens, and they have a highly effective innate immune system. By contrast, all vertebrates with a progressively well-developed adaptive immune systems all develop some form of cancer. We can therefore ask the question, "is it better for animal survival to have an innate system and be free from cancer OR possess the highly evolved adaptive system and fall vulnerable to cancer?" Here are several possible explanations derived exclusively from two diametrically diverse groups: mammals and flies that emphasize similarity in gene controlled responses to metabolic changes that are often associated with obesity, longevity and cancer, the current point. These points do lend credence to and may help clarify the question of <ref type="bibr">Perlovsky.</ref> According to Slattery and Fitzpatrick <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[16]</ref>, "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease with several hypothesized etiologic factors including inflammatory processes; hormones such as estrogen, androgen, and insulin; and energy-related factors. They have integrated this evidence in a pathway which they refer to as the convergence of hormones, inflammation, and energy-related factors (CHIEF). First, given the physiology of the gut, substantial epidemiologic and molecular data support the hypothesis that activation of innate immunity in the normal gut mucosa by various environmental agents (commensal bacteria, dietary antigens, mucosal irritants, pathogens) and endogenous factors such as estrogen, androgens, and insulin levels provoke basal inflammation as an underlying factor for the association of insulin, estrogen, and energy-related factors with CRC. Second, critical genes involved in this pathway, e.g., phosphatase tensin homologue on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and serine threonine kinase 11 (STK11)/LKB1, are tumor suppressor genes often mutated in intestinal cancer or CRC. Third, results from laboratory experiments reveal that cellular PTEN and STK11/LKB1 tumor suppressor enzymes are vulnerable to inactivation by redox-active species, especially chemically reactive lipid mediators of inflammation and redox stress. Epidemiologic results add more support to the underlying proposal that CHIEF comprises important elements of CRC risk. They suggest that a similar CHIEF pathway, although focusing on CRC, may also play an important role in the etiology of other cancers." This explanation pertains to vertebrates, especially humans.</p><p>Now to maintain a balance of possible explanations by inclusion of a well-known invertebrate model, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> agree that insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling regulates homeostasis and growth in mammals and is implicated in diseases from diabetes to cancer. In the well-known fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a mainstay model in all of biology, as perhaps in other invertebrates, multiple insulin-like peptides (Dilps) are encoded by a family of related genes. To assess Dilps' physiological roles, they generated small deficiencies that uncover single or multiple dilps, generating genetic loss-of-function mutations. Deletion of dilps1-5 generated homozygotes (homozygotic flies) that are small, severely growth-delayed, poorly viable and fertile. These flies display reduced metabolic activity, decreased triglyceride levels and prematurely activate autophagy, indicative of "starvation in the midst of plenty," a hallmark of type-I diabetes. In addition circulating sugar levels are elevated in Df[dilp1-5] homozygotes during eating and fasting. <ref type="bibr">In contrast,</ref><ref type="bibr">Df[dilp6]</ref> or Df[dilp7] flies showed no major metabolic defects. It is interesting to speculate on the physiological differences between mammals and insects that may explain the unexpected survival of lean, 'diabetic' flies. However, this is not so unlike the situation in mammals where diabetes caused by obesity may open a floodgate of metabolic diseases.</p><p>Once again, more information is derived from flies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[18]</ref>. "In metazoans, [there are] factors associated with the insulin family [that] control growth, metabolism, longevity, and fertility in response to environmental cues. [As in the other system,] in Drosophila, a family of seven insulin-like peptides, called Dilps, activate a common insulin receptor. Some Dilp peptides carry both metabolic and growth functions, raising the possibility that various binding partners specify their functions. To test this assumption, they identified dALS, the fly ortholog of the vertebrate insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein acid-labile subunit (ALS), as a Dilp partner. It forms a circulating trimeric complex with one molecule of Dilp and one molecule of Imp-L2, an IgG-family molecule distantly related to mammalian IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). In addition, that also found that dALS antagonizes Dilp function to control animal growth as well as carbohydrate and fat metabolism. These interesting results inspired by <ref type="bibr">Arquier et al.,</ref> to propose an evolutionary explanation or pathway. Briefly this view proposes that ALS function appeared prior to the separation between metabolic and growth effects that are associated with vertebrate insulin and IGFs."</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Biology the earliest ancestor</head><p>Biology is a vast discipline that has a long history punctuated by important changes in thought, approaches and applications. The history of biology can be traced to analyses of the living world from ancient to modern times <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">20]</ref>. Although the concept of biology as a single coherent field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from traditions of medicine and natural history reaching back to the ancient Egyptians. However, the greatest opening after centuries of change saw a blossoming of more biological discoveries with newer findings that formed the very backbone of the discipline. Thereafter, others have emerged and expanded continuously even further until we are approaching a renaissance that may bring one sub-discipline, immunology closer to physics. Already we are there with respect to the chemistry of life but there are explanations still lacking that may rest on principles of physics (see AIS, Quantal Theory). Only time and prescience, accompanied by experimentation, will tell.</p><p>At a very basic level, what is it that links all the disparate approaches to biology, life itself, tenets that are clearly at the root of it all? Very simply we may ascribe at least five basic principles to which almost all biologists would adhere. These include the cell theory which holds that all living organisms are composed of cells which are the basic units with the exception of unicellular organisms. A virus (from the Latin virus meaning toxin or poison) is a small infectious agent that can only replicate inside the cells of another organism. Viruses are too small to be seen directly with a light microscope. Viruses infect all types of organisms, from animals and plants to bacteria and archaea. Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus. These immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which give immunity to specific viral infections. However, some viruses including HIV and those causing viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and cause chronic infections. Microorganisms also have defenses against viral infection, such as restriction modification systems. The capacity to reproduce perpetuates the species. Evolution is another concept or tenet that surrounds and envelopes the living world, natural selection guides from generation to generation. Since the discovery by Mendel, genes are clearly the locale where the essence of specific traits are stored and passed from generation to the next. Characteristics of each refer to the genotype and the resulting trait is the phenotype. For individual well being, it is essential that there be balance in the system as defined by homeostasis. This assumes that the three internal regulatory systems: endocrine, nervous and immune are in constant harmony not to the exclusion of what may impinge from the external environment. To live organisms require energy that drives the build up and breakdown, i.e. anabolism and catabolism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Impact of the 19th century</head><p>History was propitious for biologists in the 19th century! Embryology was rapidly developing and so emerged Haeckel's dictum: Ontogeny recapitulates Phylogeny <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[21]</ref>. Moreover microbes were being revealed as vectors of disease. In this connection, two pillars of biology and zoology, Darwin and Metchnikoff were laying the foundation for the "big bang" in immunology. It is not crystal clear when that occurred but surely whether directly or indirectly this revelation was the product of a coalescence of all the ferment that the 19th century inspired. In a sense, both were field biologists highly observant and meticulous -willing to take chances on the unexplored and to express their ideas. The inquisitiveness of Darwin and the consequence of Metchnikoff's single prescient observation by the sea both represent a tour de force in the annals of biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[22]</ref>. The origin of species by natural selection underwent metamorphosis in its application to immunology and became the clonal selection theory with its inherent application to and explanation of adaptive immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[23]</ref>. By contrast, Metchnikoff's phagocytosis in starfish larvae became the ancestor of innate immunity, even with the much later advent of T-cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[26]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Self vs. non-self</head><p>"In the beginning". . ."Once upon a time". . . . Self, not self became and remained the unchallenged dictum that guided the searches of 20th century experimental immunologists especially those interested in evolution. Now in the 21st century we have moved in other directions and are guided by newer and perhaps prescient flashes of imagination and maybe even genius. Perhaps that was and is only natural since the essence of the first split giving us the cellular component of the two armed immune systems resulted from observing phagocytosis by invertebrate leukocytes -the ubiquitous cells that roam the coelomic cavity of all animals (functional equivalent of the vertebrate peritoneal cavity). Leukocytes in both regions and others are functionally equivalent and affect their functions after being irritated or disturbed. Upon closer examination at other levels of organization not reactions outside cells but inside them, we can witness rather clear examples of self/not self distinction (and an alleged memory component?). We can understand the comment of Medawar when he mentioned "nor will a goldfish accept a scale from any other." Medawar was referring to the pioneer studies of Hildemann demonstrating scale (skin graft) rejection of allografts (was homografts) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Now fast backward in time to the cell itself and witness evidence of this universal trait (immunodefense) so characteristic of all species. We need to begin with life at another level -the prokaryotes that consist of a group of organisms that lack a cell nucleus or any other membrane organelles. Prokaryotes differ from eukaryotes that possess a cell nucleus. Most of them are unicellular however there are certain prokaryotes (e.g. myxobacteria) that possess unicellular stages in their life cycles. Prokaryotes are split into two groups, the bacteria and the archaea. One other distinction worth briefly mentioning that eukaryotic organisms may be unicellular (e.g. amoebae our ancestral and highly ubiquitous macrophages) or multicellular as in plants and humans (note that this popular definition emphasizes humans and ignores the multitude of other organisms, i.e. the fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds [whose immune systems are complex especially the birds!]) Imagine the trajectory! What would the entire field of immunology have developed minus the advent of comparative immunology (a zoologist's view of immunity). Perhaps it would not have grown so rapidly without recognizing the avian bursa of Fabricius, the incubator for B-cells? Mammals have no anatomical equivalent of the bursa, but the bone marrow is the functional mammalian equivalent, a veritable warehouse of stem cells all capable of becoming functional, once in the right environment ripe for and followed by specific triggering to goad for further differentiation; among them there are B-cells. This summary is what we have that is generally acceptable for the immune system without detailing certain punctuated events in phylogenetic sequence all of which are morphologic and molecular. We have the innate and adaptive systems with each possessing various characteristics <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Animal kingdom: relevance of species in immunological research</head><p>A brief description of the animal world is instructive for this review since advances in current understanding; the mechanisms usually focus on mammals, mice and humans with no particular emphasis on what happens in other vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds). Certain invertebrates have played critical roles and contributed enormously to deciphering the intricacies of the immune system including those that are important such as earthworms [animals where there is first evidence of dissociation of phagocytosis from cell killing] (soil conservation, medicinal properties in ancient cultures, food); mollusks and crustaceans (food); Drosophila, C. elegans (extremely crucial in all aspects of biomedical research no obvious economic benefit). At least mice have been crucial in understanding mechanisms yet within another context, there seems to be no practical importance for humans. For fish and birds the opposite is true. They are of economic importance as food not withstanding the possible controversial role they may play in the sport industry.</p><p>Several scientists who cross discipline have questioned the utility of reserving aspects of immunity, especially the self/not self model as being a characteristic of multicellular species. And why not open the inquiry since prokaryotes and simpler eukaryotes comprise a group of organisms that evolved early and remain among the most dominant that have developed amazing survival strategies. Insects, for example, reproduce in large numbers thus insuring perpetuation, they are short lived and therefore perhaps less vulnerable to the ravages of uncontrolled internal cell aggression better known as cancer which is common in vertebrates. Their innate immune systems are far more efficient than the heavily laden bureaucratic system of vertebrates most especially mammals including humans. The raison d'Ãªtre for the evolution of cancer needs to be explained at the level of cell markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">29]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Acquired immunity in prokaryotes: the ultimate in evolutionary precursors?</head><p>It is appropriate to offer another definition crucial for understanding origins of self/not self, memory and the concepts of clonal selection, tolerance, etc. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are direct repeats found in the DNA of many bacteria and archaea. These repeats range in size from 24 to 48 base pairs. They usually show some dyad symmetry but are not truly palindromic. The repeats are separated by spacers of similar length. Spacers are usually unique in a genome. Some spacer sequences match sequences in phage genomes; it has been proposed, and more recently demonstrated, that these spacers can be derived from phage and subsequently help protect the cell from infection. Consequently, an active CRISPR repeat array may evolve rapidly. Different strains of the same species of bacterium often can be differentiated according to differences in the spacers in their CRISPR arrays, a technique called spoligotyping.</p><p>What are the implications? "Understanding the mechanism of action of CRISPR systems has progressed quickly in the past few years; it may indeed represent a prokaryotic analog of eukaryotic RNA interference systems that provides bacteria with a form of acquired immunity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">31]</ref>. According to van der Oost et al., "the recently discovered CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) defense system protects bacteria and archaea against mobile genetic elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[32]</ref>. The potential for immune systems to continuously adjust their reach at the genomic level, suggests that both gain and loss of information is inheritable for. Recent analyses of key Cas proteins indicate that, despite some functional analogies, this fascinating prokaryotic system shares no phylogenetic relation with the eukaryotic RNA interference system."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Origins of immune system components</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Unicellular colonial protozoans</head><p>How multicellular animals evolved from a protozoan ancestor is relevant to immunity and clearly a central question in animal evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[33]</ref>. In order to answer this question, there are two possibilities: the first approach to animal origins is to determine which developmental proteins may have predated them and may have been subsequently coopted for their development. Second, another strategy to explore involves competitive genomics a technique that can identify the minimal set of intact genes from the beginning of animal evolution this could reveal those genes that are shared by all animals and their nearest relatives. To attempt a resolution to the mystery of origins, investigators have sampled gene diversity expressed by choanoflagellates. These are unicellular and colonial protozoa that are closely related to metazoan and therefore, crucial for providing possible clues concerning early animal evolution. Thus choanoflagellates express representatives of an unexpected number of cell signaling and adhesion protein families that have not been previously isolated from non-metazoans. These include cadherins, C-type lectins, tyrosine kinases and components of tyrosine kinases signaling pathways. Choanoflagellates have a complex and dynamic tyrosine phosphoprotein profile, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors selectively affect cell proliferation; this is significant. The expression in choanoflagellates of proteins involved in cell interaction in metazoa suggests that these proteins evolved before the origin of multicellular animals and may have been later co-opted for development. A similar situation exists with respect to components of the signaling system in relation to immunity and development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Emergence of multicellularity: social amoeba (a special case)</head><p>At the multicellular level, there is evidence of immune-associated characteristics. A recent exciting study by Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[34]</ref> has revealed that, social amoebae feed on bacteria in the soil but aggregate when starved to form a migrating slug. They discovered an unknown cell type in social amoeba that may facilitate detoxification and immune-like functions; these so-called sentinel (S)-cells. S-cells engulf bacteria and sequester toxins while circulating within the slug and are eventually sloughed off. Molecular intervention is essential by means of a Toll/interleukin-l receptor (TIR) domain protein, TirA, is required for S-cell functions and for vegetative amoebae to engulf live bacteria. (Bacteria are a large group of unicellular microorganisms.) This apparent innate immune function in social amoebae and the utilization of TirA aided phagocytosis suggests an ancient cellular foraging mechanism. Moreover it may have been adapted to immunodefense functions well before animal diversification. Multicellularity likely increased the selective pressure on an organism's ability to avoid exploitation by pathogens. TirA function in Dictyostelium's response to bacteria is a first observation of an immune-related signaling system in amoebae. This suggests that employing the TIR domain based signaling for primordial immunity represents an ancient function present in a progenitor of all eukaryotes. If this is confirmed by further experimentation, this system of pathogen recognition may be interpreted as advantageous to organisms before multicellularity evolved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Sponges</head><p>Sponges (phylum Porifera) are filter feeders; therefore they are extremely exposed to microorganisms that represent a potential threat to survival. During evolution and emergence of multicellular animals, the need arose to defend the animal's body against foreign organisms that threaten their homeostasis. TLRs are essential in mediating the innate immune response among many different receptors that participate in the recognition of microbial pathogens. After binding distinct microbial components, TLRs activate intracellular signaling cascades resulting in induced expression of diverse antimicrobial molecules. Examining sponges Wiens et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[35]</ref> have identified, cloned and deduced the protein sequence from 3 major elements of the poriferan innate response: the TLR, the interleukin-l (IL-1) receptorassociated kinase-4-like protein (IRAK-4l), and a novel effector caspase has been isolated from the demosponge Suberites domuncula. Each molecule shares significant sequence similarity with its homologues in higher metazoa. There were also sequence homologies especially within the family-specific domains Toll/IL-l receptor/resistance (TLR family), Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase domain (IRAK family), and CASe (caspase family). Sponges are phylogenetically the oldest extant metazoan phylum already possessed signaling pathways that characterize metazoan antimicrobial immune systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Hydra and corals</head><p>Characterization of the innate immune repertoire of extant cnidarians is of both fundamental and applied interest. First it provides insights into basic immunological components of this group of common ancestral animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[36]</ref>. Second, according to Miller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[36]</ref>, it may be important in understanding certain pathological conditions such as the current global decline of coral reefs. To delve further, whole genome sequences are now available for two cnidarians, Hydra magnipapillata and Nematostella vectensis. Moreover, there are available large expressed sequence tag data sets for them and for the coral Acropora millepora. To better understand the basis of cnidarian innate immunity, investigators have scanned available expressed sequence tag and genomic resources for certain crucial components of the vertebrate innate immune repertoire. They focused on the Toll/TLR and complement pathways. Results revealed a canonical Toll/TLR pathway in cnidarians. Neither was classic Toll/TLR receptor nor a conventional nuclear factor-kB -identified in Hydra -a hydrazoan. Thus finding complement C3 and several membrane attack complex/perforin domain (MAC/PF) proteins suggest that a prototypic complement effector pathway may exist in anthozoans, but not in hydrozoans. Thus Hydra may have undergone substantial secondary gene loss during evolution. Such patterns of gene distribution may underscore the possible significance of gene loss during animal evolution but indicate ancient origins for components of the vertebrate innate immune system. We have now arrived at the level of multicellularity and systems where relevant theories of immune response evolution may be critically examined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Protostomes and deuterostomes: increased immune complexity</head><p>"Among higher animals, there are two basic divisions, the protostomes and the deuterostomes. Early in the development of these animals, they undergo a process called gastrulation. Originally a ball of cells one layer thick, the embryo develops a second layer by making an indentation that goes deep enough to form a tube right through the embryo. This tube later forms the digestive tract. The hole that forms first from the gastrulation is called the blastopore. What makes the protostomes and the deuterostomes different is what the blastopore becomes. In most members of the former group, the blastopore becomes the mouth, while in the latter group it becomes the anus. In some protostomes, however, the blastopore actually becomes both at the same time, by becoming a long slit that zips itself up the middle with the mouth and anus at each end. There is no "right" way to do gastrulation; all three ways are equally effective. It is possible that the original ancestors of both supergroups were a type of flatworm that developed via the third method of gastrulation, and that the other two method evolved later. If we could isolate the genes that code for gastrulation in the various types of animals, we could understand how the process occurs and how it could have changed over time via mutation. Protostomes include the arthropods, which form by far the greatest number of animal species that exist. Over 85%, some scientists estimate. Mollusks, annelids, roundworms, and some flatworms are also protostomes. Deuterostomes include vertebrates and echinoderms. People who have a hard enough time accepting that humans have a common ancestry with apes must really be disturbed by the idea that humans, and virtually all other animals, are descended from WORMS! Oh, well, let their egos scream" [37].</p><p>Although multicellularity has increased to the highest level among invertebrates, these differences in protostomes and deuterostomes center around early embryologic differentiation as explained above. However, such a seemingly single criterion for separating the two groups should not remain as the sine qua non characteristics that may prevent assigning common or generalized features of immune capability among various invertebrate groups (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Any observed differences in invertebrate immune phenomena may be attributed to several arbitrary criteria: techniques, availability of species or the particular focus of a laboratory. Among the familiar protostomes (annelids, e.g.</p><p>[earthworms]; molluscs [e.g. snails, mussels, oysters]; arthropods [e.g. insects, shrimps]), there are numerous and varied immune characteristics that may be largely due to experimental questions or expertise and a driving emphasis. Sometimes even a question of prevailing investigative fashion. For example, the immunologic characteristic of transplant rejection was first discovered and easily performed repeatedly in earthworms <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[38]</ref>; earthworms thus became the animal of choice when the question of transplant rejection emerged. Newer questions and experimental approaches to earthworm immunity have been designed leading to expansions into experimental design aimed at understanding cell and humoral mediators <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">40]</ref>.</p><p>More variations prevail when mollusks and arthropods are viewed and none of the characteristics involve the immune system of transplants as in earthworms. Mollusks have been especially useful in analyzing the family that encodes fibrinogen related proteins (FREPS) in the freshwater mollusk Biomphalaria glabrata <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">42]</ref>. These results are particularly enlightening since the antigen, a parasite, is a trematode (flatworms) Schistosoma mansoni (another invertebrate); this parasitic flatworm is crucial in the development of schistosomiasis a human disease. Invertebrate vectors of parasites add a newer dimension to characteristics of invertebrate innate immunity in relation to human survival. We may therefore question the utility of a power mammalian innate immune capacity if it tolerates the intrusion of an invertebrate, the parasite (obviously it does not; witness schistosonmasis). Then from another viewpoint, analyzing the immune system of edible mussels has gone in another direction approaching ever more complex assessment of immune gene expression, resulting in the formulations of a knowledge base of mussel transcribed sequences (MytiBase) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[45]</ref>. An extraordinarily diverse and plentiful group, the arthropods deserve attention for equally informative mechanisms. Results have revealed differences due to choices of viruses as antigen accompanied by appropriate assay systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[43]</ref>. A novel protein system has been discovered that acts as a negative regulator of prophenoloxidase activation and melanization in the freshwater crayfish <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">47]</ref>. Formation of melanin or melanization appears to be a common feature of innate immunity in most invertebrates.</p><p>Deuterostomes are of great interest and they include certain marine species, the echinoderms (sea urchins, starfish) and the protochordates (e.g. tunicates). The tunicates possess closer affinity to vertebrates due to certain developmental characteristics shared with chordates: 1) notochords; 2) pharyngeal gill slits where lymphocyte-like cells reside (suggestive of the presence of thymus precursors); 3) endostyle or thyroid gland; 4) dorsal tubular nerve cord (derived from ectoderm, one of the primary germ layers; 5) post-anal tail; 6) segmentation. Closest to the chordates are the protochordates that include the common marine sea squints ("sea peach"), important in understanding lectins as substances that enhance immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[48]</ref>. Even more fascinating is the capacity of their immune cells to grow and multiply in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[49]</ref>. Viability was first demonstrated as long-term cultivation of leukocytes. These lymphocyte-like cells are partially responsible for specific graft rejection responses. Protochordates are unique with respect to specific responses since the responsible cells are derived from the pharyngeal region, the source of thymic lymphocytes in vertebrates. The echinoderms have figured prominently in understanding origins of the complement system. Complement is a complex group of proteins with nearly ten components found/derived from the liver and crucial to the human immune system as a mediator of lytic reactions. The complement system is a biochemical cascade that helps clear pathogens from an organism a crucial component of the innate immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">51]</ref>. Among these complex invertebrate, we can visualize what is yet to be viewed in vertebrates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Danger? Going against the grain?</head><p>For essentially all of its 20th century life, immunology has grown and been propelled by a single penetrating explanatory force: self/not self. Recently, immunologists have argued that self/not self is irrelevant and that it actually detects "danger" or "strangers." Both of these viewpoints present problems. Since the immune system has been pieced together throughout evolution and utilizes a vast compendium of innate and adaptive defense mechanisms, it is now possible to define immunity more broadly and not confine it within one "paradigm" or another. Vance <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[52]</ref> has described the provocative suggestion that the immune system may not distinguish "self" from "not self." It instead may respond to "danger," and such a view has appeared in leading scientific journals <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[56]</ref> and partly because of its connotation, danger is even in mass media <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[60]</ref>. As a result the word "danger" has become common in everyday immunological discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">62]</ref>. One point in its favor centers on its capacity to clarify. Those who advocate the danger theory as an innovative "paradigm" in immunology may assist in helping to explain certain "anomalies" of earlier theories.</p><p>The attention has been so pervasive that some danger theorists have compared the danger theory to the Copernican Revolution of the 16th century, i.e. a heliocentric view of the solar system replaced the ancient geocentric view <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[63]</ref>. As would be expected there is a reaction and growing consensus that the danger theory is not a Copernican derivative <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[67]</ref>. Nevertheless by opening up and relaxing our seeming obsession with a single model, we may come to think of the immune system as a larger and diverse collection of mechanisms and processes that have been interwoven together during the course of evolution. Enormous intellectual benefits will accrue. We should likely inherit much after this relaxation. Thus the details of certain mechanisms and their interactions will guide the interest of immunologists, without boxing them neatly into one "paradigm pen" or another. Now, we can turn to two examples: an invertebrate and vertebrate that support danger.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.1.">Innate immunity in a moth Galleria mellonella</head><p>Here is an insect system where experimental results support the danger theory. Altincicek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[68]</ref> have worked with thermolysin-like metalloproteinases such as aureolysin, pseudolysin, and bacillolysin that represent virulence factors of diverse bacterial pathogens. Injection of thermolysin into larvae of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, mediated strong innate immune responses. Thermolysin-mediated proteolysis of hemolymph proteins yielded a variety of small-sized (&lt; 3 kDa) protein fragments (protfrags) that strongly induce innate immune responses. Thermolysin then activated a serine proteinase cascade by, as described for bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). This then causes a rapid immune reaction found in most insects and some crustaceans. As a confirmation this group employed quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses of the expression of immune-related genes that encoded the inducible metalloproteinase inhibitor, gallerimycin, and lysozyme. They found increased transcriptional rates after challenge with purified protfrags similar to those rates after challenge with LPS. In addition they were able to induce a similar spectrum of immune-responsive proteins secreted into the moth's hemolymph. For further confirmation they used comparative proteomic analyses of hemolymph proteins from controlled untreated larvae and from experimental larvae that have been challenged (immunized) with either protfrags or LPS. Implications are pervasive G. mellonella is now a valuable model for Cryptococcus neoformans infection and its pathogenicity. We may better understand the mechanisms of immune responses in G. mellonella specifically and other arthropods in general. Moreover these results also support the danger model, i.e. that the immune system was activated or triggered after having sensed endogenous alarm signals during infection. This does not exclude the propensity of most invertebrates to recognize and react to perhaps non-infectious microbial or non-microbial pattern recognition molecules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.2.">Tumor growth in Drosophila melanogaster: more fuel for danger</head><p>Evolution of the immune system as development against cancer remains contentious. The paradox concerns the lack of cancer development and most if not all invertebrates without an adaptive immune system as in vertebrates. The innate immune systems seem to suffice. Deciphering those mechanisms involved in tumor progression is essential to understanding immune recognition (immunologic surveillance) and cancer development. Pastor-Pareja et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[69]</ref> seem to have an example of innate immune response to tumors in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Circulating blood cells, termed hemocytes, readily adhere to tumors after they have detected disruption of basement membranes; this leads to blockage of growth. Basement membrane components show high conservation throughout the animal kingdom, providing a unique structure for the immune system to sense tissue integrity. Tissue damage activates JNK signaling in both tumors and aseptic wounds, and this causes expression of JAK/STAT-activating cytokines. Later, the response cascades so that cytokine secretion occurs later from injured tissues that are then amplified into a systemic response by the induction of additional cytokine expression in hemocytes and in the fat body an important organ in most insects. Then, finally, there is proliferation of hemocytes. The implications of these results are important since they suggest common mechanisms in responses to tumors and wounds in flies. Moreover, there may be a similar innate reaction that underlies responses to tumors and tissue damage in vertebrates and in humans." However there seems to be no data on whether hemocyte proliferation occurs by recruitment or by cell multiplication. Cell multiplication would support clonal selection, prima facie evidence of adaptive immunity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10.">An exemplary model of granulocyte reactions that support danger</head><p>Now we explore a model where adaptive immunity is the rule. Moving now to a human system, eosinophilic granulocytes occur in tissues found at interfaces with the external environment, e.g. the gastrointestinal, genitourinary and respiratory tracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[70]</ref>. According to Stenfeldt and WennerÈ§s, the second most numerous of human leucocytes is often associated with tissue damage in various diseases. In a simple but elegant experiment, these investigators evaluated whether necrotic epithelial cells can activate eosinophils. The danger theory postulates that cells of the innate immune system primarily recognize substances that signal danger to the host. To add supporting evidence they damaged epithelial cell lines derived from genital (HeLa cells), respiratory (HEp-2 cells) and intestinal tracts (HT29 cells) and assessed their capacity to cause eosinophilic migration, release of putative tissue-damaging factors, e.g. eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). They also analyzed for secretion of tissue-healing factors, e.g. fibroblast growth factors (FGF)-1 and -2 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. Results revealed that necrotic intestinal cells induced chemotaxis in human eosinophils. EPO release was elicited in eosinophils stimulated with necrotic cells and from viable HEp-2 and HT29 cells. Release of ECP was observed only in eosinophils incubated with necrotic intestinal or genital cells. Necrotic intestinal and genital cells elicited FGF-2 eosinophil secretion. TGF-beta1 was released from eosinophils exposed to viable and necrotic HT29 cells. These results strongly suggest that eosinophils can recognize and can be activated by danger signals released from damaged epithelial cells. These important implications help our understanding the role of eosinophils in various inflammatory conditions. As an evolutionary parallel it is of interest that a substantial number of invertebrate leukocytes are heavily laden with potent cytoplasmic granules. There is a need to analyze them in relation to responses following injury or provocations that occur in the coelomic cavity where they reside. Even without precise experimentation, predictions favor similar results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.1.">Advantages of danger</head><p>Agreeing with Vance <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[52]</ref>, there is compelling evidence that adaptive and innate systems do blur. For comparison, it is well to begin with the adaptive in order to dispel or even diffuse partiality so the problem does not focus overwhelmingly on the innate. Vance explained: "The underlying delusion is that immune responses obey a small set of laws like the movements of the planets obey the law of gravity. The danger theory even proposes to encompass immunity in just three "Laws of Lymphotics." Digressing, Vance asks, why not; rather think of the immune system as a much more diverse collection of mechanisms and processes that have been cobbled together during the course of evolution? Thus the details of these mechanisms and their interactions will ultimately be of interest to immunologists, and not whether they conform to one "paradigm" or another." Faced with this dilemma obviously influenced by diversity, structure, and habitat, immunologists concerned with vertebrate responses are gradually beginning to open up to blurring as a mosaic that overlaps.</p><p>"Many biologists and psychologists love this term, when faced with the complexity of organisms. But in fact, there is no scientific evidence for using this term, and this term might be misleading. I published a paper which demonstrated that information needed to evolve complex forms, in evolution, accumulates very fast, exponentially (combinatorially) <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[71]</ref>. Therefore there is enough accumulated information for evolution of mathematically optimal designs. Of course my paper uses certain assumptions; still it follows that "cobbling together" is not a necessarily required mechanism; on the opposite, any "non-optimality," when suggested, has to be explained and defined (what is optimality in such a complex system, which is designed to solve unknown future problems? How could it be verified? It could be very different from simple math of the introductory calculus). I argued against "kludge" "cobbled together" in several papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[72]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.2.">Frogs, the first terrestrial vertebrates</head><p>Moving now to viewpoints of immunologists with strong ties to adaptive responses in primitive vertebrates. Flajnik and Du Pasquier <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[73]</ref> assert, "several recent findings in the field of comparative immunology have reinforced the importance of examining the molecular and functional features of immune systems in a variety of organisms. Particularly exciting are the discoveries of a new gene rearrangement mechanism in lampreys and a somatic diversification of immune genes in mollusks. These immune features now found in animals previously believed to have only innate immunity, as well as the flood of information on immune genes, molecules and mechanisms in many different creatures, have been progressive and enlightening. This leaves us open to a reexamination of the existing perhaps artificial dichotomy between adaptive and innate immune systems since there are still no startling conclusions [that would demolish either]. There is the hope that should encourage different thought patterns and indeed experimentation when analyzing immune systems."</p></div>

Moreover, there is increasing experimental accessibility of non-mammalian jawed vertebrates (gnathosomes; cartilaginous and bony fish), jawless vertebrates (agnathans) (hagfish, lampreys), protochordates and invertebrates and a willingness of comparative immunologists to explore. As a result we have intriguing new information that suggests likely patterns that reveal emergence of immune-related molecules during metazoan phylogeny. Moreover there is the promise that we may find evolution of alternative mechanisms that ensure receptor diversification. In this regard there is a suggestion that such findings blur traditional distinctions between adaptive and innate immunity. They also emphasize that throughout evolution, the immune system has benefited by using a remarkably extensive variety of well-equipped mechanistic solutions to meet fundamentally similar requirements for host protection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.4.">Concurrence: the gnathosomes (jawed fish)</head><p>Going several steps forward in support of blurring there is continued and equal openness to newer views <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[54]</ref>. Litman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[76]</ref> proposed that clonal commitment, selection, and expansion of B and T lymphocytes that express diversified receptors provide the underlying basis for adaptive immune responses in jawed vertebrates. The rearrangement and somatic modification of segmental genetic elements that encode the constituent components of immunoglobulins and T-cell antigen receptors form the basis for this process. Although no evidence exists for a similar mechanism in animals other than jawed vertebrates; clearly, invertebrates and jawless vertebrates (agnathans) are subjected to continuous exposure to pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The invertebrates and agnathans and gnathosomes all encode various mediators of innate immunity. In invertebrates, there is extensive germ line diversification of conventional innate receptors, and by contrast there are molecules that resemble innate receptors but that undergo germ line (innate) as well somatic (adaptive) modification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.5.">The case for overlapping molecules</head><p>The range of such molecules, which includes the fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) in a mollusk, variable regioncontaining chitin-binding proteins (VCBPs) in a cephalochordate, variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) in jawless vertebrates, and novel immune-type receptors (NITRs) in bony fish, encompasses both the immunoglobulin gene superfamily (IgSF) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins. Although these molecules vary markedly in form and likely in function, growing evidence suggests that they participate in various types of host immune responses. These results represent significant alternatives to prevailing paradigms of innate and adaptive immune receptors. Thus unusual genetic mechanisms may support mechanisms for diversifying recognition proteins and it may be a ubiquitous characteristic of animal immunity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[86]</ref>, not restricted rigidly to innate and adaptive. In other words, innate versus adaptive, in short, non-memory versus memory and recognition and confirmation of the outcome, may depend on genetic background and how it interacts with an antigen. This may yield an overlap of characteristics, i.e. what we refer to as blurring. This also implies a range of characteristics that may be neither "black nor white," "long nor short", "all nor none." Perhaps a simple analogy is worth adding. The range of human height is not all short nor all tall; there are extremes: all tall or all short or certainly, and clearly, there are variations -ranges that are genetically determined and so it is with immune capability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="11.6.">A viewpoint from earthworm immunologists</head><p>Lending more credence to blurring, Kvell et al. have reached similar conclusions from a group, unlike others, consisting of a mix of vertebrate and invertebrate immunologists with particular emphasis on earthworms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[87]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[88]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[92]</ref>. Adaptive immunity has often been considered the penultimate of immune capacities. That system is now being deconstructed in order to encompass less stringent rules that govern its initiation, actual effector activity, producing ambivalent results. Expanding the repertoire of innate immunity found in all invertebrates has greatly facilitated a relaxation of convictions concerning what actually constitutes innate and adaptive immunity. Two animal models, incidentally not on the line of chordate evolution (C. elegans and Drosophila), have contributed enormously to defining homology. The characteristics of specificity and memory and whether the antigen is pathogenic or nonpathogenic can reveal considerable information on homology. Strict definitions become blurred casting skepticism on the utility of creating rigid criteria that define what innate and adaptive immunity are without considering overlaps <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. </p></div>

The survival advantage gained through adding this type of adaptive immune system to pre-existing innate immune systems led to the evolution of alternative ways for lymphocytes to generate diverse antigen receptors for use in recognizing and repelling pathogenic invaders. All jawed vertebrates assemble their antigen receptor genes through recombinatorial rearrangement of different immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene segments. The surviving jawless vertebrates, lampreys and hagfish, instead solved the receptor diversification problem by the recombinatorial assembly of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) genetic modules that encode variable lymphocyte receptors. The convergent evolution of these remarkably different adaptive immune systems involved innovative genetic modification of innate immune system components.</p></div>

Jawed vertebrates generate a diverse repertoire of B-and T-cell antigen receptors through the rearrangement of immunoglobulin V, D, and J gene fragments, whereas jawless fish assemble their variable lymphocyte receptors through recombinatorial usage of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modular units. Invariant germ line-encoded, LRR-containing proteins are pivotal mediators of microbial recognition throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. Whereas the genomes of plants and deuterostome (and probably protostomes as well) and chordate invertebrates harbor large arsenals of recognition receptors primarily encoding LRR-containing proteins, relatively few innate pattern recognition receptors (the best known in invertebrates) suffice for survival of pathogen-infected nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. The appearance of a lymphocyte-based recombinatorial system of vertebrates' anticipatory immunity may have evolved by a need to facilitate developmental and morphological plasticity in addition to the advantage conferred by the ability to recognize a larger portion of the antigenic world. This assumes that vertebrates are exposed to a greater panoply of antigenic insults a point that can be contentious since most vertebrates inhabit more or less "sterile" environments than do invertebrates (e.g. laboratory mice and humans). In stark contrast invertebrates fend for themselves by their deployment of their innate immune systems (unknowingly and without pharmaceutical assistance!).</p></div>

Recently claims have been made for radical new insights in the field of invertebrate immunology that involve memory, specificity and/or maternal transfer of immunocompetence, all hallmarks of vertebrate type adaptive immunity.

They draw implicit analogy (not homology) to adaptive responses in jawed vertebrates and the terminology that has been used creates an incomplete and misleading picture. Hauton and Smith argue that the case for adaptive immunity in invertebrates is weak and flawed. Why this strong view? They insist that acceptance can only be supported if backed up by descriptions of underlying mechanisms. Moreover, they caution against this approach as a means of advancing comparative immunology in general and invertebrate immunology in particular. There are larger implications for they highlight as an example certain commercial repercussions if we adopt this approach.

Drosophila melanogaster, like other invertebrates, relies solely on its innate immune response to fight invading microbes; by definition, innate immunity lacks adaptive characteristics. However, they reveal that priming Drosophila with a sub-lethal dose of Streptococcus pneumoniae protects against an otherwise-lethal second challenge of S. pneumoniae. This protective effect exhibits coarse specificity for S. pneumoniae and persists for the fly's life. Although not all microbial challenges induced this specific primed response, they observed that a similar specific protection could be elicited by Beauveria bassiana, a natural fly pathogen. To characterize this primed response, they focused on S. pneumoniae-induced protection. The mechanism underlying this protective effect requires phagocytes and the Toll pathway. However, activation of the Toll pathway is not sufficient for priming-induced protection. This work contradicts the paradigm that insect immune responses cannot adapt and will promote the search for similar responses overlooked in organisms with adaptive immune responses. With these results, the gap seems to be narrowing between adaptive and innate immune responses or our views are being broadened.</p></div>

Systematic analysis of the innate immune response in Drosophila melanogaster by these groups provided important insights into the mechanisms of pathogen recognition and host response. Recognition of pathogen-associated molecules, such as peptidoglycans, stimulates the Toll and immune deficiency (Imd) pathways to induce antimicrobial responses. The Toll and Imd pathways are homologous to the mammalian Toll-like receptor (TLR) and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) signaling pathways, respectively, and are essential for Drosophila to survive infection. These findings only add to the growing controversy and beg for further analyses in multiple labs. It would indeed be an anachronistic turnabout if more instances of homology/analogy were revealed. Deconstructing the bifurcated immune paradigm would of course be a major contribution and have great interest if supported by firm and less controversial evidence.</p></div>

The essential reason for AIS recognizes experts in the discipline who are farsighted with respect to novel ideas that may fit alongside evolution and therefore the implication for interdisciplinary research is more biologically realistic AISs are now emerging. According to <ref type="bibr">Garrett [103]</ref>, the field of artificial immune systems (AIS) concerns an analysis of, and development of computationally interesting abstractions of the immune system. AIS are defined in terms of "distinctiveness" and "effectiveness." The standard types of AIS include other familiar paradigms: Negative Selection, Clonal Selection and Immune Networks -as well as a new breed of AIS, based on the immunological "danger theory." These three proposals touch upon adaptive immunity. Yet adding the danger theory, AIS could well include innate immunity that makes space for invertebrates. According to Twycross and Aickelin <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[104]</ref>, artificial immune systems (AISs) have generally been inspired by naive biological metaphors that could limit the effectiveness of these systems. They define two ways in which AISs could be made more biologically realistic. First, AISs should draw their inspiration from organisms that possess only innate immune systems. Second, AISs should employ systemic models of the immune system to fabricate their overall design to be more precise this should include plant and invertebrate immune systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="15.2.">Computational vs. natural immune systems</head><p>According to an extended definition, Forrest and Beauchemin <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[105]</ref> have described computational immune systems that behave analogously to the natural immune system, in agreement with relegating a more prominent role to the innate immune system. Such artificial immune systems (AIS) simulate the behavior of the natural immune system and in some cases have been used to solve practical engineering problems such as computer security. They suggest that AIS possesses strengths that may complement the usual wet lab immunology. Moreover they favor expanding the view for at least two reasons. They proposed that it is easier to: 1) Conduct simulation experiments and to vary experimental conditions, for example, to rule out hypotheses; 2) Isolate a single mechanism to test hypotheses about how it functions as derived from agent based models of the immune system; 3) Integrate data from several different experiments into a single in silicon experimental system, i.e. performed on computer or via computer simulation.</p><p>In a more recent modification, Chavali et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[106]</ref> recognized that the immune system is comprised of numerous components that interact with one another to give rise to phenotypic behaviors that are sometimes unexpected. This prompted yet another definition accompanied by more models. Agent-based modeling (ABM) and cellular automata (CA) belong to a class of discrete mathematical approaches in which autonomous entities detect local information and act over time according to logical rules. This is interpreted as a strong approach since it depends upon the emergence of behavior that arises from interactions between agents; this would otherwise be impossible to know a priori. Although not completely clear, they propose that exploring the immune system with ABM and CA has revealed novel insights into immunological processes. Especially relevant, they suggest that these applications to immunology and, particularly, how ABM can help formulate hypotheses might drive further experimental investigations of disease mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16.">What is the quantal theory of immunity?</head><p>Finally, the question, exactly how the immune system discriminates between all environmental antigens to which it reacts vs. all self-antigens to which it does not, is a principal unanswered question in immunology <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[107]</ref>. Because of advances in understanding the immune system that have occurred in the last 50 years, for the first time it is possible to formulate yet a new theory only superseded by the danger theory, termed the "Quantal Theory of Immunity," which reduces the problem from the immune system as a whole, to: 1) The individual cells that comprise it; 2) A molecular explanation as to how the system behaves as it does. Earlier Smith <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[108]</ref> proposed the view of immunity during the past years; immunologists have accumulated a staggering amount of information on functions of the immune systems. Still, one of the most fundamental aspects of immunity, how the immune system discriminates between self vs. not self, still remains an enigma. This would seem to beg for the inclusion of the danger theory to resolve or at least help to reconcile.</p><p>Any attempt to explain this most intriguing and fundamental characteristic must account for this decision at two levels: 1) the whole immune system; 2) individual cells that comprise the immune system; 3) the peregrinations and unparallel mobility of immune cells, unlike cells of endocrine and nervous systems that are mobile that further complicates understanding. Moreover, it must provide for a molecular explanation as to how and why cells behave as they do. The "Quantal Theory" is based upon the "Clonal Selection Theory," first proposed by Sir McFarlane Burnet in 1955, in which he explained the remarkable specificity as well as diversity of recognition of everything foreign in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">109]</ref>. The "Quantal Theory" is built upon Burnet's premise that after antigen selection of cell clones, a proliferative expansion of the selected cells ensues. In the context of the current review the quantal theory seems irrelevant to the innate immune system. Clearly, AIS are more relevant and the perception of danger aids our understanding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="17.">Will the danger model accommodate invertebrate and vertebrate immunity?</head><p>According to Noble, recognition of specific protein antigens leads to immunological memory of antigen, whereas recognition of danger signals by the innate immune system determines the size, nature and longevity of a response <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[110]</ref>. Recent data indicate that recognition of danger might have long-lasting effects on CD8 memory T-cell populations, specifically enhancing early cytokine release and thus altering the nature of subsequent immune responses.</p><p>Here, a modified model of immune regulation is proposed in which a nonspecific immunological memory of danger accumulates during maturation of the immune system, allowing more potent cell-mediated immunity to develop in dangerous environments. It seems that the optimal approach would be to continue analyses at the interface between complex invertebrates and the agnathans or jawless vertebrates. Moreover, there is a real need to do the bench work and to think more deeply about updating papers that seem to more expansively explain. These papers may no longer be extremely revealing and enlightening from the viewpoint of vertebrates and adaptive immunity. With the exception of Houton and Smith (who caution invertebrate immunologists) they seem to be ultra fine-tuning of what has been previously explained without newer information.</p></div>

What Hath Metchnikoff Wrought?

Whatever the consequences Darwinian evolution is a cause for celebration 2008-2009. The new nexus positions invertebrates once again at a new point as the evolution of the immune system remains largely undefined.</p><p>T-cells: 'T-cells' belong to a group of white blood cells known as lymphocytes, and play a central role in cell-mediated immunity. They can be distinguished from other lymphocyte types, such as B-cells and natural killer cells by the presence of a special receptor on their cell surface called T-cell receptors (TCR). The abbreviation T , in T-cell, stands for thymus, since this is the principal organ responsible for the T-cell's maturation. Several different subsets of T-cells have been discovered, each with a distinct function. Thermolysis: (Thermal decomposition) a chemical reaction in which a chemical substance breaks up into at least two chemical substances when heated. The reaction is usually endothermic as heat is required to break chemical bonds in the compound undergoing decomposition. Tolerance: (immunological tolerance) either (a) "natural" or "self tolerance," where the body does not mount an immune response to self antigens, or (b) 'induced tolerance', where tolerance to external antigens can be created by manipulating the immune system. It occurs in three forms: central tolerance, peripheral tolerance and acquired tolerance. Toll/interleukin-1: the Toll genes encode members of the Toll-like receptor class of proteins. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is one of the first cytokines ever described. Its initial discovery was as a factor that could induce fever, control lymphocytes, increase the number of bone marrow cells and cause degeneration of bone joints. At this time, IL-1 was known under several other names including endogenous pyrogen, lymphocyte activating factor, haemopoetin-1 and mononuclear cell factor, amongst others. It was around 1984-1985 when scientists confirmed that IL-1 was actually composed of two distinct proteins, now called IL-1Î± and IL-1Î². Toll-like receptors together with the Interleukin-1 receptors form a receptor superfamily, known as the "Interleukin-1 Receptor/Toll-Like Receptor Superfamily"; all members of this family have in common a so-called TIR (Toll-IL-1 receptor) domain. Tyrosine kinases: an enzyme that can transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue in a protein. Tyrosine kinases are a subgroup of the larger class of protein kinases. Phosphorylation of proteins by kinases is an important mechanism in signal transduction for regulation of enzyme activity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Phylogenetic tree of the animal kingdom highlighting the evolution of key immunological elements.

Overlaps and parallels surrounding the lives of Darwin and Metchnikoff seem worth mentioning. Darwin was born in 1809 and died in 1882 at 74 years whereas Metchnikoff was born in 1845 and died in 1906 at 71 years. In 1908 Metchnikoff received the Nobel Prize 99 years after the birth of Darwin in 1908 whereas the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth is being celebrated in 2009. Darwin's well-known epic The Origin of Species was first published in 1859 when he was 50 years old and when Metchnikoff was only 14 years old. The crossings and crisscrossing do continue. At 14 years Metchnikoff was already the budding zoologist imbued with an interest in animals, their lives and habitats quite the central thesis of Darwin's work as well that resulted from his now famous expeditions. This crisscrossing along with other aspects of 19th century biology surely must have contributed to a pervasive ambience that fostered discovery and creativity -biology and immunology reaped the benefits. There was the experimental approach of Metchnikoff who discovered in the field an all important principle that rests undisputed today in immunology. His observation split the monolithic field of immunology into the two main camps, cellular and humoral giving cause to celebrate in 2008-2009.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glossary</head><p>Adaptive immune system: highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate or prevent pathogenic challenges. Thought to have arisen in the first jawed vertebrates, the adaptive or "specific" immune system is activated by the "non-specific" and evolutionarily older innate immune system (which is the major system of host defense against pathogens in nearly all other living things). The adaptive immune response provides the vertebrate immune system with the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens (to generate immunity), and to mount stronger attacks each time the pathogen is encountered. It is adaptive immunity because the body's immune system prepares itself for future challenges. Adaptive immunity: see Adaptive immune system. Allografts: Allotransplantation (allo-from the Greek meaning "other") is the transplantation of cells, tissues, or organs, sourced from a genetically non-identical member of the same species as the recipient <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[1]</ref>. The transplant is called an allograft or allogeneic transplant or homograft.</p><p>Most human tissue and organ transplants are allografts. Anamnesis (immunologic memory): the capacity of the immune system to respond more rapidly and strongly to subsequent antigenic challenge than to the first exposure.</p><p>Anthozoans: a class within the phylum Cnidaria that contains the sea anemones and corals. Autoimmunity: the failure of an organism to recognize its own constituent parts as self, which allows an immune response against its own cells and tissues. Any disease that results from such an aberrant immune response is termed an autoimmune disease. Prominent examples include Coeliac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1 (IDDM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). B-cells: lymphocytes that play a large role in the humoral immune response (as opposed to the cell-mediated immune response, which is governed by T-cells). The principal functions of B-cells are to make antibodies against antigens, perform the role of Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) and eventually develop into memory B-cells after activation by antigen interaction. B-cells are an essential component of the adaptive immune system. Bacillolysin: a protease isolated from species of Bacillus that catalyzes the preferential hydrolysis of peptide bonds involving the amino group of leucine or phenylalanine. to certain chemicals in their environment. This is important for bacteria to find food (for example, glucose) by swimming towards the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from poisons (for example, phenol). In multicellular organisms, chemotaxis is critical to early (e.g. movement of sperm towards the egg during fertilization) and subsequent phases of development (e.g. migration of neurons or lymphocytes) as well as in normal function. In addition, it has been recognized that mechanisms that allow chemotaxis in animals can be subverted during cancer metastasis. Choanoflagellates: a group of free-living unicellular and colonial flagellate eukaryotes considered to be the closest living relatives of the animals.</p><p>As the name suggests, choanoflagellates (collared flagellates) have a distinctive cell morphology characterized by an ovoid or spherical cell body 3-10 Âµm in diameter with a single apical flagellum surrounded by a collar of 30-40 microvilli. Clonal selection: a widely accepted model for how the immune system responds to infection and how certain types of B and T lymphocytes are selected for destruction of specific antigens invading the body. Cnidarians: Cnidaria (pronounced /naÎ¹dÎµ e ri e / with a silent c) is a phylum containing over 9000 species of animals found exclusively in aquatic, mostly marine, environments. Their distinguishing feature is cnidocytes, specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey. Their bodies consist of mesoglea, a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick. They have two basic body forms: swimming medusae and sessile polyps, both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration. Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like zooids, or both. Coelomic cavity (Coelom): a fluid filled cavity formed within the mesoderm. Coeloms developed in triploblasts but were subsequently lost in several lineages. Loss of coelom is correlated with reduction in body size. C-type: (of lectins -see lectin) that which requires calcium for binding. Cytokine: any of a number of substances that are secreted by specific cells of the immune system which carry signals locally between cells, and thus have an effect on other cells. They are a category of signaling molecules that are used extensively in cellular communication. They are proteins, peptides, or glycoproteins. The term cytokine encompasses a large and diverse family of polypeptide regulators that are produced widely throughout the body by cells of diverse embryological origin. Cytoplasmic: of or related to the part of a cell that is enclosed within the cell membrane. In eukaryotic cells, the contents of the cell nucleus are not part of the cytoplasm and are instead called the nucleoplasm. In eukaryotic cells, the cytoplasm contains organelles, such as mitochondria, which are filled with liquid that is kept separate from the rest of the cytoplasm by biological membranes. The cytoplasm is the site where most cellular activities occur, such as many metabolic pathways like glycolysis, and processes such as cell division. The inner, granular mass is called the endoplasm and the outer, clear and glassy layer is called the cell cortex or the ectoplasm. Danger hypothesis: Polly Matzinger went several steps further by laying out the idea that antigen-presenting cells respond to "danger signals"most notably from cells undergoing injury, or stress or "bad cell death" (as opposed to apoptosis, controlled cell death). The alarm signals released by these cells let the immune system know that there is a problem requiring an immune response. She argued that T-cells and the immune response they orchestrate occurs not because of a neonatal definition of "self," as in the previous model, nor because of ancient definitions of pathogens, as in Janeway's argument, but due to a dynamic and constantly-updated response to danger as defined by cellular damage. Eosinophilic: Eosinophilic means loves eosin, and refers to the staining of certain tissues, cells, or organelles after they have been washed with eosin, a dye. Granulocytes: a category of white blood cells characterized by the presence of granules in their cytoplasm. They are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN or PML) because of the varying shapes of the nucleus, which is usually lobed into three segments. In common parlance, the term polymorphonuclear leukocyte often refers specifically to neutrophil granulocytes, the most abundant of the granulocytes. Granulocytes or PMN are released from the bone marrow by the regulatory complement proteins. Homografts: a graft of tissue taken from a donor of the same species as the recipient.</p><p>Humoral: of or relating to the body fluids or humors. Retrieved from http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/humoral. Hydrozoans: a taxonomic class of very small, predatory animals which can be solitary or colonial and which mostly live in saltwater. A few genera within this class live in freshwater. Hydrozoans are related to jellyfish and corals and belong to the phylum Cnidaria. Immunologic surveillance: a theory that the immune system continually recognizes and removes malignant cells that arise during one's life. Innate immune system: the cells and mechanisms that defend the host from infection by other organisms, in a non-specific manner. This means that the cells of the innate system recognize and respond to pathogens in a generic way, but unlike the adaptive immune system, it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[1]</ref>. Innate immune systems provide immediate defense against infection, and are found in all classes of plant and animal life. Palindromic: of or relating to a word, phrase, number or other sequence of units that can be read the same way in either direction (the adjustment of punctuation and spaces between words is generally permitted). Peritoneal cavity: a potential space between the parietal peritoneum and visceral peritoneum, that is, the two membranes that separate the organs in the abdominal cavity from the abdominal wall. It is one of the spaces derived from the coelomic cavity of the embryo, the others being the pleural cavities around the lungs and the pericardial cavity around the heart. Pathway: sequence of biochemical compounds, and the reactions linking them, that describe a process in metabolism or catabolism. Retrieved from http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pathway. Phagocytosis: the cellular process of phagocytes and protists of engulfing solid particles by the cell membrane to form an internal phagosome.</p><p>Phagocytosis is a specific form of endocytosis involving the vesicular internalization of solid particles, such as bacteria, and is therefore distinct from other forms of endocytosis such as the vesicular internalization of various liquids. Phagocytosis is involved in the acquisition of nutrients for some cells, and in the immune system it is a major mechanism used to remove pathogens and cell debris. Bacteria, dead tissue cells, and small mineral particles are all examples of objects that may be phagocytosed. Porifera: Sponges are animals of the phylum Porifera. Their bodies consist of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells.</p><p>While all animals have unspecialized cells that can transform into specialized cells, sponges are unique in having some specialized cells that can transform into other types, often migrating between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have nervous, digestive or circulatory systems. Instead most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes Proteinase: any enzyme that conducts proteolysis, that is, begins protein catabolism by hydrolysis of the peptide bonds that link amino acids together in the polypeptide chain forming the protein. Proteases work best in acidic conditions. Protozoa: microorganisms classified as unicellular eukaryotes Pseudolysin: (Pseudomonas elastase) Reaction: Hydrolysis of proteins including elastin, collagen types Iii and iv, fibronectin and immunoglobulin A, generally with bulky hydrophobic group at P1 . Insulin B chain cleavage pattern identical to that of thermolysin, but specificity differs in other respects. Other name(s): Pseudomonas aeruginosa neutral metalloproteinase. Pseudomonas elastase. Cofactor(s): Calcium; Zinc. Comments: Causes tissue damage. Belongs to peptidase family M4. S-cell: cells which release secretin, found in the jejunum and duodenum. They are stimulated by a drop in pH to 4 or below in the small intestine's lumen. The released secretin will increase the secretion of HCO â into the lumen, via the pancreas. Self/not self: host constituents and "the other" -pathogens, foreign substances, altered host elements. Serine: an organic compound with the formula HO CCH(NH 2 )CH 2 OH; one of the naturally occurring proteinogenic amino acids.</p></div>			</div>

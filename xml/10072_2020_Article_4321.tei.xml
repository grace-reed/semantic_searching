			<abstract>
				<p>Prion diseases are a group of rare neurodegenerative disorders that develop as a result of the conformational conversion of normal prion protein (PrP C) to the disease-associated isoform (PrP Sc). The mechanism that actually causes disease remains unclear. However, the mechanism underlying the conformational transformation of prion protein is partially understood-in particular, there is strong evidence that copper ions play a significant functional role in prion proteins and in their conformational conversion. Various models of the interaction of copper ions with prion proteins have been proposed for the Cu (II)-binding, cell-surface glycoprotein known as prion protein (PrP). Changes in the concentration of copper ions in the brain have been associated with prion diseases and there is strong evidence that copper plays a significant functional role in the conformational conversion of PrP. Nevertheless, because copper ions have been shown to have both a positive and negative effect on prion disease onset, the role played by Cu (II) ions in these diseases remains a topic of debate. Because of the unique properties of paramagnetic Cu (II) ions in the magnetic field, their interactions with PrP can be tracked even at single atom resolution using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Various NMR approaches have been utilized to study the kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural properties of Cu (II)-PrP interactions. Here, we highlight the different models of copper interactions with PrP with particular focus on studies that use NMR spectroscopy to investigate the role played by copper ions in prion diseases.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Prion diseases are a family of rare and progressive neurodegenerative disorders that develop as a result of the conformational conversion of the normal form of the transmissible prion protein (PrP C ) into the disease-associated form (PrP Sc ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These diseases usually take many years to develop; during the incubation period, the disease advances asymptomatically in the brain until initiation of nervous system degeneration and subsequent death <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Human (Hu) PrP C is a 209-residue glycoprotein that is attached by a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of a brain cell. Prion proteins are highly conserved among mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, where the general structure of globular domain protein, PrP C contains three αhelices and a two-strand antiparallel β-sheets, an NH -terminal tail consisting of an octapeptide repeat-containing unfolded domain, and GPI attached to the short COOHterminal tail <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Repeated published reports noted that copper may play a significant role in the conversion of PrP C to PrP Sc <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig.  2)</ref>. Moreover, several reports have shown that cellular prion protein (PrP) may play a crucial role in the redox control of the neuronal environment and in the regulation of copper metabolism in a manner that contributes to disease pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The concentration of copper in humans varies in different organs. A high copper concentration is found in the liver, brain, kidney, and heart <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. In these organs, copper is essential for the function of several enzymes, including cytochrome C oxidase, catalase, dopamine hydroxylase, uricase, tryptophan dioxygenase, lecithinse, and other monoamine and diamine oxidases as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. These enzymes are important in oxidationreduction reactions, transport of oxygen and electrons, and protection of the cell from oxygen radicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>. Changes in copper ion concentrations in the brain are associated with several neurological diseases including prion diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Gasperini et al.</ref> showed that PrP C and copper jointly inhibit N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and prevent cell death, thus suggesting a positive role for copper in disease treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. They also showed that PrP C and copper cooperatively protect neurons from insults and exert neuroprotective effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Advances in medical research and technology, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and imaging, have contributed enormously to the detection and management of prion diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> as was successfully demonstrated in the detection and description of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. In particular, NMR spectroscopy provided the first three-dimensional (3D) structure of the folded mouse prion protein domain PrP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref>. Recently, structures of other PrP-associated diseases were resolved using NMR spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[147]</ref>. In addition, NMR enabled the investigation of the dynamic equilibria between monomeric and oligomeric misfolded states of mammalian PrP <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[148]</ref>. contains an octapeptide repeat-containing unfolded domain at the Nterminal tail, three α-helices (α1, α2, and α3), antiparallel β-sheets (β1 and β2), and a GPI-anchor signal at the C-terminal tail</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prion disease</head><p>Prion diseases, such as human prion diseases, are a group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by conformational conversion of the α-helix-rich isoform of the prion protein (PrP C ), which is the normal form, into the β-sheet rich isoform (PrP Sc ), which is the disease-associated form <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">149,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">150]</ref>. Abnormal folding of the protein (PrP Sc ) leads to brain damage and causes high fatality rates in both humans and animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[151]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[152]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[153]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[154]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[155]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[156]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[157]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[158]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[159]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[160]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[161]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[162]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[163]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[164]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[165]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[166]</ref>. However, the pathogenic mechanism that triggers this abnormal folding leading to prion diseases remains unknown. Prion diseases may take many years to develop with long incubation periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">149]</ref>; during this time, the disease grows asymptomatically in the brain until the initiation of nervous-system degeneration and resulting death <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The infection causes brain atrophy, spongiform encephalopathy, and cerebellar degeneration. Although prion diseases are rare, they remain an important public health issue requiring attention to their management <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[167]</ref>.</p><p>Prion diseases can be contracted through sporadic, genetic, and infectious routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[168]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[169]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[170]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[171]</ref>. An individual who contracts a prion disease sporadically is exposed to unknown risk factors that vary from one region to another <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[169]</ref>. Some people and animals can inherit prion diseases from their parents, whereas others acquire it from contaminated animal products and feed. The most common types of animal prion diseases are scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), and transmissible mink encephalopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[172,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">173]</ref>. Examples of human prion diseases are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Kuru, fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">174,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">175]</ref>. Neurological clinical presentations and diagnosis vary among the different human prion diseases. Research has shown that Kuru disease has been eradicated, where it acquired through consumption of the brains of infected humans killed by the disease during the practice of funerary cannibalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[176]</ref>. FFI is an autosomal illness characterized by lesions in the thalamus of the brain. GSS is associated with the pathological Q212P mutation, and, like CJD, results in progressive dementia <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">177]</ref>. CJD is associated with mutation in the gene encoding the prion protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[178]</ref> and the most common and fatal prion disease <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>, with about 90% of affected individuals dying within a year of diagnosis. Early symptoms include poor coordination, visual disturbance, and memory problems; later symptoms include blindness, weakness, involuntary movement, and finally coma.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Copper ions in nervous system development and neurodegenerative disorders</head><p>Copper ions are found in all living organisms.

Moreover, it is fundamental for normal brain and nervous system development, as it is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and in the production and maintenance of myelin <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">174,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">175]</ref>.</p><p>Copper-containing compounds have also been used in medicine for centuries. Several studies proposed that copper chelators may play a potential therapeutic role in certain  <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[147,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">177]</ref>, and prion diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[172,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">173,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">180,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">181]</ref>. Various treatments for prion disease have been trialed. One was based on the use of the copper chelator D -penicillamine ( D -PEN), which demonstrated a delay in the onset of prion disease in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[182,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">183]</ref>. In another trial, a significant delay in the onset of prion disease was observed when scrapieinfected hamsters were treated with copper. Copper ions inhibit in vitro conversion of prion protein into amyloid fibrils <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. In cross-correlation analyses, it showed an antiaggregatory effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[184]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[185]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[186]</ref>. Altered levels of copper and manganese ions have been observed in prion-infected brain tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[182]</ref>.</p><p>Copper can have one of several oxidation states, including Cu (IV), Cu (III), Cu (II), and Cu(I); the most common states are Cu(I) and Cu (II) <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[187]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[188]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[189]</ref>. The coordination chemistry of Cu(I) is different from that of Cu (II), because Cu(I) complexes usually have a lower coordination number (CN) than C (II) complexes have. For example, Cu(I) complexes are usually tetrahedral or square planar with CN = 4, trigonal with CN = 5, or linear with CN = 2, whereas Cu (II) complexes usually have higher coordination numbers (primarily octahedral, with CN = 6). The large number of possible combinations of copper ions allows for a wide range of copper coordination complexes, ranging from monodentate to hexadentate <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[190]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[191]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[192]</ref>. Importantly, Cu(I) has d configurations and forms colorless and diamagnetic compounds, whereas Cu (II) has d 9 configurations and forms colored and paramagnetic compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[193]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[194]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[195]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[196]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[197]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[198]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[199]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[200]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[201]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[202]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[203]</ref>. There is an important difference in stability of Cu(I) and Cu (II) ions that strictly defines their biological role in the living organisms. The low stability of Cu(I) has led to the relative scarcity of studies on the biological roles of Cu(I) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>, whereas the higher stability of Cu (II) has led to extensive examination of its biological role in neurodegenerative disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[204]</ref>.</p><p>Studies have highlighted the role of Cu (II) ions in synaptic transmission, axonal targeting, neurite outgrowth as well as in the modulation of signaling cascades induced by neurotrophic factors. Copper not only modulates neurotransmitter receptors at synapses but it can also affect the trafficking of synaptic vesicles and modulate the interaction between proteins involved in secretory vesicle pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[205]</ref>. Copper is clearly important in the normal development of the brain and nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">[206]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">[207]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">[208]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">[209]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[210]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">[211]</ref>. It follows that copper deficiency can lead to nervous system degeneration. A decrease in copper from its normal levels can lead to several neurodegenerative and other diseases where aggregation of proteins plays a crucial role</p></div>

On the other hand, an excessive amount of copper (applicable especially to Cu (II) ions) can lead to cytotoxicity, owing to the ability of Cu (II) to initiate redox cycling and to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">[213,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">214]</ref>.

This suggests that PrP is a target of copper-catalyzed oxidation and that this reaction leads to profound structural changes in the protein.

Hornshaw et al. showed the first link between copper and prion proteins in 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[86]</ref> in an investigation of the binding between different transition metals and synthetic peptides.

Another study showed that copper ions bind to His96 and His111 of wild-type PrP at pH 5.5, whereas it interacts with His111 at pH 7.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[202]</ref>. Pathological point mutations alter copper coordination under acidic conditions and metal is then anchored to His111 <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[202]</ref>. Additional studies have since confirmed that PrP specifically and preferentially binds copper compared with other transition metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">93]</ref>. Some reports have claimed that interaction with Mn causes conversion of PrP c to PrP res , as detected by in vitro studies. Near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis suggested that (i) PrP binds both Mn and Cu differently, (ii) PrP-Cu, and not PrP-Mn, protects the metal from the water, increasing protein stability, and (iii) PrP-Cu remains stable in solution, whereas PrP-Mn undergoes changes leading to fibril formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[94]</ref>.</p><p>Later studies have shown that the binding of copper to PrP can affect its conformational transition to the infectious form.

A similar study showed that the interaction of Cu (II) ions with PrP promotes a shift from a predominant α-helical structure of PrP C to the β-sheet structure of the infectious isoform, PrP Sc , thus suggesting a negative role for copper ions in disease onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[97]</ref>. The results do not support Takeuchi's proposal that the interaction of copper with prion proteins may lead to conformational changes (formation of an α-helical structure on the C-terminal side) that prevent aggregation. Zheng et al. studied the impact of the G127V mutation on the structural and dynamical properties of PrP using NMR and molecular dynamic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[189]</ref>.

In contrast, Hijazi et al. found that copper plays a protective role in prion diseases, as they observed a significant delay in prion disease onset in scrapieinfected hamsters treated with copper ions, whereas administration of copper ions to normal hamsters promoted cerebellar PrP C accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[99]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[103]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[104]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[105]</ref><ref type="bibr">[106]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[107]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[108]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[109]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[110]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[111]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[112]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">202]</ref>.

Consequently, NMR studies of PrP are typically performed at low copper-ion-to-PrP ratios. Diamagnetic Cu(I) ions that facilitate the use of NMR studies at higher copper-to-PrP ratios are unstable compared with Cu (II) ions and can be easily oxidized to Cu (II) under physiological conditions.

Here, we present heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) as an example of the most powerful approaches used to assign signals and to probe ligand protein interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">[243]</ref>. HSQC is a type of through-bond correlation spectroscopy that utilizes heteronuclear correlations and enhancement of the signal coming from the nucleus of lower sensitivity, such as 13 C or 15 N by transferring the nuclear spin polarization from the more sensitive nucleus (usually 1 H) via J-coupling. The general output of HSQC is 2D spectra of the chemical shift of one nucleus, such as 1 H, which is usually detected in the directly measured dimension, and the chemical shift of the other nucleus, such as 13 C, which is recorded in the indirect dimension. The H, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> C-HSQC spectrum coordinates the chemical shift of protons and nitrogen or carbon atoms that are directly covalently bonded, providing only one cross peak for each H-N or H-C coupled pair. Thus, HSQC is useful for the assignment of the protein backbone and side-chain NH signals are assigned by H, 15 N-HSQC. Moreover, utilizing the sensitivity of the H atom is an effective approach to reducing the experimental time for nuclei with low natural abundances and/or sensitivities, such as N and 13 C. The experimental time necessary for HSQC experiments is usually shorter than for D, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> C, and N NMR experiments.

For example, Wells et al. used NMR to investigate how Cu (II) ions interact with the full length of PrP under acidic conditions at pH 5.5.

The resulting NMR spectra show a clear broadening of the histidine 1 H residues in each octarepeat coordinated with the Cu (II) ion, with the four octarepeat peptides cooperatively binding to four Cu (II) ions. Two-dimensional H-1 H TOCSY NMR spectroscopy has been used to study the interaction between copper and the residue 91-127 fragment of the human prion protein (hPrP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">[268]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">[269]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b271">[270]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b272">[271]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b273">[272]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b274">[273]</ref>.

The interaction of Cu (II) ions with full-length PrP has been investigated under mildly acidic conditions. The results show that two Cu (II) ions bind all six histidine residues of the unfolded N-terminal domain and the N-terminal amine coordinate as ligands <ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[260]</ref>.

Similar studies have shown that PrP binds between five and six equivalent units of Cu (II) at pH 7.4, indicating that the interaction of copper with PrP is highly dependent on pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b281">[280]</ref>. These reports have proposed that PrP functions may be associated with its ability to bind copper in a pHdependent fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b281">[280]</ref>.

The results show that Cu(I) interacts with PrP in a manner different from that of Cu (II), with the Cu(I) interaction representing a tetrahedral model in which copper coordinates with two imidazoles attached to His96 and His111 and two sulfurs (Met109 and Met112) <ref type="bibr" target="#b283">[282,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b284">283]</ref>. The interaction between the copper ions and Met residues has sparked a strong debate in the literature concerning possible direct binding with sulfur atoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">[284]</ref>. Several reports have ruled out the <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> a Aromatic region of the 1H 1D NMR spectra of hPrP91at pH 7.2 in the presence of mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in the absence (black) and presence (green) of Cu2+. b 2D TOCSY spectra of the aliphatic region with a copper-to-ligand ratio of 1:10. c The aliphatic region of the 1H-1H 2D TOCSY spectra with a metal-to-ligand ratio of 1:1.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">[231,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b261">[260]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b262">[261]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b263">[262]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b264">[263]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b265">[264]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b266">[265]</ref> possibility of copper interacting with Met109 or Met112 <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">[285]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b287">[286]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b288">[287]</ref>. However, Shearer et al. demonstrated that copper interacts with both Met residues in PrP under mildly basic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b266">[265,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b285">284]</ref>. These contradictory results may be explained by considering the factors that might lead to different copper-PrP coordination models. Different factors should be considered in explaining that different copper-prion interactions, such as the pH, copper oxidation state, and copper/ protein ratio, may lead to different copper-PrP coordination models. For example, the copper oxidation state is a very important factor that determines copper complexation because Cu(I) normally adopts a tetrahedral coordination geometry, whereas Cu (II) prefers an octahedral or square planar coordination geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b289">[288,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b290">289]</ref>. Cu(I) ions can be oxidized simply to Cu (II), and Cu (II) can be reduced to Cu(I), thus enabling copper to be involved in electron transfer reactions and copper-protein interactions and potentially leading to conformational changes associated with changes in the oxidation state <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">[290]</ref>. To elucidate the role of copper in prion diseases, further investigations should be conducted to study the relationship between electron transfer reactions and the conformational transformation associated with copper-protein interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that occur when prion proteins change their conformation from the normal PrP C form to the disease-specific PrP Sc structure. These diseases affect both humans and animals. Animals acquire prion diseases from contaminated feed or other animals, whereas humans can contract prion diseases genetically, sporadically, or via acquisition from infected animals and humans. Although the disease pathology is not completely understood, there is general agreement that the abnormal disease-associated protein conformation (PrP Sc ) causes prion diseases through the degeneration of the nervous system and leads to death at an advanced stage. It has been repeatedly reported that copper ion may play a major role in structural conversion from a healthy (native) α-helix rich PrP isoform to the predominantly β-sheet conformation (PrP Sc ). The conversion could be developed by the exposure of the protein to high concentrations of Cu (II) ions.</p><p>It is well established that an excessive amount of copper (especially Cu (II) ions) can lead to cytotoxicity, owing to the ability of Cu (II) to initiate redox cycling and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, despite the wide range of studies on copper interaction with prion proteins, the mechanisms by which Cu (II) ions induced protein misfolding and aggregation remains unknown.</p><p>The proper application of the NMR spectroscopy techniques could lead to better insight if the studies include both protein function and structure. A gradual titration of prion proteins with different concentration levels of Cu (II) ions could lead to the most optimal concentration as we believe like other bioactive molecules with low or high concentrations could lead to abnormal conditions. To evaluate the copper redox effects, it is also important to study the interaction of PrP with different copper oxidation states, particularly ion (I\II) interactions. The NMR spectroscopy offers atomiclevel insights into the interactions of copper ions (I\II) with PrP under physiological conditions (like pH~7.4), enabling researchers to study the role played by copper and other ions in the progress of the prion disease. source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

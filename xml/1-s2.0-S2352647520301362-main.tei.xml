			<abstract>
				<p>Background: Sunscreens are topical preparations containing one or more compounds that filter, block, reflect, scatter, or absorb ultraviolet (UV) light. Part 2 of this review focuses on the environmental, ecological effects and human toxicities that have been attributed to UV filters. Methods: Literature review using NIH databases (eg, PubMed and Medline), FDA and EPA databases, Google Scholar, the Federal Register, and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Limitations: This was a retrospective literature review that involved many different types of studies across a variety of species. Comparison between reports is limited by variations in methodology and criteria for toxicity. Conclusions: In vivo and in vitro studies on the environmental and biological effects of UV filters show a wide array of unanticipated adverse effects on the environment and exposed organisms. Coral bleaching receives considerable attention from the lay press, but the scientific literature identifies potential toxicities of endocrine, neurologic, neoplastic and developmental pathways. These effects harm a vast array of aquatic and marine biota, while almost no data supports human toxicity at currently used quantities (with the exception of contact allergy). Much of these data are from experimental studies or field observations; more controlled environmental studies and long-term human use data are limited. Several jurisdictions have prohibited specific UV filters, but this does not adequately address the dichotomy of the benefits of photoprotection vs lack of eco-friendly, safe, and FDA-approved alternatives.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In Part 1, we describe the regulatory recommendations that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued in February 2019 for non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreens to ensure their safety, efficacy, and consistency in labeling. We reviewed practical uses of UVFs and the AAD's recommendations for sun protection as well as the need for more options for safe use in children and adults. In part 2 we will review the ecologic and biologic potential toxicities of UVFs. This part of the review is a survey of data regarding UVF effects and is not meant to give guidance on choices of UVF or the appropriate use of sunscreen agents as these were reviewed in part 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Sabzevari N, Qiblawi S, Norton S, Fivenson D, 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions</head><p>When reviewing scientific data, it is essential that readers understand the terminology. For example, titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is not a sunscreen. It is a UV filter (UVF) that is included in many commercial products known as sunscreens.</p><p>Sunscreen: a commercial product sold to consumers for protection of human skin from UV radiation. Sunscreens contain one or more UVFs that may be physical, chemical, or both. In addition, they contain many other substances, such as emollients, preservatives or stabilizers, emulsifiers, fragrances, and coloring compounds. Broad spectrum sunscreens are defined by the FDA as products that provide UVA protection that is proportional to its UVB protection (FDA-US, 2017, 2019a).</p><p>According to the FDA, ''a product that includes the term ''sunscreen" in its labeling or in any other way represents or suggests that it is intended to prevent, cure, treat, or mitigate disease or to affect a structure or function of the body comes within the definition of a drug in section 201(g)(1) of the act. Sunscreen active ingredients affect the structure or function of the body by absorbing, reflecting, or scattering the harmful, burning rays of the sun, thereby altering the normal physiological response to solar radiation. These ingredients also help to prevent diseases such as sunburn and may reduce the chance of premature skin aging, skin cancer, and other harmful effects due to the sun when used in conjunction with limiting sun exposure and wearing protective clothing."</p><p>https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/ cfrsearch.cfm?fr=700. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> UV filter: a specific compound that impedes the passage of UV light. These are typically divided these into chemical (absorbing UV rays and converting to thermal energy) vs. physical agents (reflecting UV rays). Environmental chemists categorize them in several ways, for example, organic vs. inorganic, lipophilic vs. hydrophilic. The National Library of Medicine databases sometimes refer to these compounds as sunscreening agents (confusing to all of us at times), and define them as chemical or physical agents that protect the skin from sunburn and erythema by absorbing or blocking ultraviolet radiation. UVFs are also used in consumer cosmetics <ref type="bibr">(makeup, nail polish, shampoo, etc.)</ref> and industry <ref type="bibr">(plastics, paints, sealants, etc.)</ref> to protect against photodegradation.</p><p>Environment: the surroundings or conditions in which a person, animal, or plant lives or operates.</p><p>Ecosystem: the interactions between the environment and the organisms that dwell within it. GRASE: defined by the FDA OTC Glossary (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/training/ otc/topic3/images/Glossary.pdf)</p><p>''A drug is not considered a new drug only when it is generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE). In order to conclude a GRASE determination, a drug must satisfy three criteria: 1. The particular drug product must have been subjected to adequate and wellcontrolled clinical investigations that establish the product as safe and effective. 2. Those investigations must have been published in the scientific literature available to qualified experts. 3. Experts must generally agree, based on those published studies, that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses. At a minimum, the general acceptance of a product as GRASE must be supported by the same quality and quantity of scientific and/or clinical data necessary to support the approval of a New Drug Application."</p><p>Few UVFs used in FDA-approved sunscreen products are considered GRASE but are sold under the definition of a 'Marketed Unapproved Drugs' as they have been in use for a long time, but may be lacking the rigorous testing described in this OTC Glossary definition (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) (FDA-US, 1978, Food and Drug Administration (US) (2006). Sources: BASF Sunscreen Simulator-https://www.sunscreensimulator.basf.com/Sunscreen_Simulator/login/register, The Skin Cancer Foundation https://www.skincancer. org/skin-cancer-prevention/sun-protection/sunscreen/, in part from the FDA Fact Sheet on sunscreen issued in February of 2019 and from Federal Register FDA Proposed Rule February 2019 https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-advances-new-proposed-regulation-make-sure-sunscreens-are-safe-and-effective. Legend:GRASE = generally recognized as safe and effective. *INCI Name = International Nomenclature for Cosmetic Ingredients.^USAN Name = United States Adopted Name, PCPC only = Personal Care Products and Cosmetics use this UV absorber but not in sunscreen products. UVA1: 340-400 nm, UVA2: 320-340 nm, UVB: 290-320 nm Legend Marine: relating to bodies of saltwater such as oceans and seas. Aquatic: relating to bodies of freshwater such as lakes, streams, rivers, ponds, etc.</p><p>Estuarine: relating to bodies of water formed where freshwater from rivers and streams flowinto the ocean, mixing with the seawater. Estuaries and the lands surrounding them are places of transition from land to sea, and from freshwater to saltwater.</p><p>Biota: living things in an ecosystem.</p><p>Legislative actions related to the environmental impacts of UV filters</p><p>In the FDA proposed rule of February 2019, under CFR 25.31 for Human Drugs and Biologics, Section XIV, (FDA in, US-FDA, 2019b,c), it is stated ''this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required."</p><p>Nevertheless, many potentially harmful environmental effects of UVFs have been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Blitz and Norton, 2008)</ref> and led to the restriction of specific ingredients believed responsible for these changes (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables and 2)</ref>). Hawaii, Key West and the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) have recently passed ordinances and/ or legislation that prohibits the use of chemical sunscreens BP-3 and octinoxate (OMC), as correlation was found between these substances and coral reef bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Bever, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Fleshler, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lim, 2019a, 2019b</ref> specific sunscreen products that have been deemed harmful to coral reefs and marine life <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Blum, 2019)</ref>. The Hawaii and Key West bans are set to start to take effect in January 2021 and prohibit the sale of sunscreens containing the UVFs BP-3 or OMC without a physician's prescription. The USVI began banning importation of sunscreens on December 31, 2019 with importing of sunscreens. On March 30, 2020, the sale or distribution of sunscreen products containing these UVFs was added to the ban. After January 1, 2021, transporting them into the USVI or possessing them will be completely banned, with first time violators facing potential fines of up to $1,000. The Virgin Islands National Park has stated that mineral sunscreen products with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are the only sunscreens permitted for use by visitors and residents <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Fajardo, 2019)</ref>. The Hawaii ban was challenged by the AAD and the Hawaii Dermatological Society, citing that removing accessibility to broad spectrum sunscreen ingredients could create a public health concern.</p><p>These bans will lead to fewer products that can prevent skin cancers like melanoma, but may contribute to a public perception of sunscreens being unsafe products in general. Furthermore, these bans legislation does not emphasize that we are in need of newer, safer, and highly effective sunscreen ingredients as we reviewed in Part 1 of this review. <ref type="bibr">(1 (Sabzevari N, Qiblawi S, Norton S, Fivenson D, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">AAD.ORG, 2019a</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UV filter effects on coral reefs</head><p>BP-3, OMC, OC and sulisobenzone have been considered as threats to coral reefs around the world and an estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen, some containing as much as 10% BP-3, are washed off swimmers into coral reef areas annually <ref type="bibr">Lim, 2019a, 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Mitchelmore et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Du et al., 2017)</ref>. The impact of sunscreen pollution is possibly being magnified by public health messaging on skin health and skin cancer prevention. However, it is important to note the magnitude of UVF effects is far below other factors endanging coral reefs, (e.g. rising ocean temperatures, acidification and loss of CO2 metabolism from plankton) which is expanded below in section 4 <ref type="bibr">Lim, 2019a, 2019b;</ref>.</p><p>Coral bleaching refers to the loss of the essential symbiotic unicellular algae called zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp), that live within the newly developing tips of living coral called coral polyps. This results in a loss of color on the outer margins and a whitening or bleaching effect. Coral reef ecosystems support many marine biota, so many other species can be affected by repeated bleaching events that lead to coral death.</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that some UVFs may contribute to and exacerbate widespread coral bleaching in marine ecosystems especially in coastal areas popular with recreational swimmers <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Mitchelmore et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Environmental Working Group, 2019a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Corinaldesi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">Wood, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Danorvaro et al., 2008)</ref>. These studies have included UVF concentration data from many beaches and urban ports as well as remote and unpopulated marine environments. Most studies suggest that UVFs are present in beach water and sand in steady state concentrations ranging from 10 ng/L to 1ug/L but changes occur in relation to degrees of human activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Scheil et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Mao et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Mitchelmore et al., 2019)</ref>. There is little data on the high flux of UVF washing off swimmers or divers at peak recreational times or sites. Recent studies along beaches of the French Riviera, Hawaii, as well as rivers and lakes near these tourist populations do support this as a toxicity risk <ref type="bibr">(Kung et</ref>  Several species of hard coral have been studied in situ using living corals in laboratories that keep cultures bathed in seawater circulated from adjacent beachfronts. Other studies use in vitro cultures of algae to test toxicity of UVF exposure directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Sieratowicz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">He et al., 2019a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">He et al., , 2019b</ref>. The studies have shown that toxicity is found in the ranges of 10-300ug/L depending on UVF and species (10-100x the reported concentrations from various locales worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Labille et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Mitchelmore et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Du et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Narla and Lim, 2020)</ref>. Gross effects were noticed within 18-48 hours, followed by complete bleaching within 96 hours. Untreated controls showed no change.</p><p>There is also a suggestion that UVF promote the propagation of latent viral infections in the zooxanthellae which force them to enter a lytic cycle and then be expelled from the coral polyp <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Danovaro and Corinaldesi, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Downs et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Paredes et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Giraldo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Corinaldesi et al., 2018)</ref>. The subsequent die-off of zooxanthellae creates stressful survival conditions for the coral. Corals can survive the stress of a transient bleaching event, but when corals are stressed they are subject to mortality. Recovery can begin once the stress is removed and algae repopulate the tender coral polyps, however, continued exposure can kill corals. Other studies have shown UVFs to have direct effects on ossification and DNA structure of larval coral <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1</ref> NOAA Infographic-https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/news/sunscreen-corals.html,) <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(Ruszkiewicz et al., 2017;</ref>, see references with <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Approximately 60% of the world's coral ecosystems are currently threatened due to various causes, many of which are anthropogenic (i.e. related to human activity), including UVF contamination <ref type="bibr">(Danorvaro et al., 2008)</ref>. Thus coral bleaching may be a consequence of UVF pollution but the magnitude of their effects is not clear as many other factors can affect corals (see below). Caution with use of organic/chemical UVF containing sunscreens with preferences for inorganic/physical UVF products containing ZnO and/or TiO2 is still the best advice for patients, along with UV-protective clothing and avoidance of peak hours of sun exposure and follows the guidelines of the AAD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other causes of coral bleaching</head><p>Warming of ocean water temperatures (as well as sudden cooling) can also lead to coral bleaching, with numerous cycles of this phenomenon reported in the Pacific over the last century <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Narla and Lim, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Cheng et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Slattery et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Hughes et al., 2019</ref>; Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority [GBRMPA], 2016; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Barkley et al., 2018)</ref>. Thus global warming and changes in warmer ocean currents (el niño) can impact coral health <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Eakin, 2016)</ref>. Inorganic UVF (eg. ZnO, TiO ) and organic UVF (eg. BP-3, octinoxate and OCTO) may also promote this effect in ocean water <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Corinaldesi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Jovanovic and Guzman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lim, 2019a, 2019b)</ref>. By absorbing or refracting UV rays, UVFs transfer thermal energy which creates localized increases in water temperatures, much the same as when applied to human skin <ref type="bibr">(Lim, Thomas, Rigel Photoprotection in Photoaging, Marcel Dekker 2008)</ref>. Blocking UV transmission through water can also indirectly damage coral by inhibiting photosynthesis within zooxanthellae <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Danovaro et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>While studies quantifying the magnitude of these UVF effects, it is generally accepted that they are smaller than other factors which are toxic to corals. Rising temperatures also due to higher CO2 in the atmosphere, acidification due to CO2 dissolving in oceans, toxic chemicals and microplastic pollution with resulting die-off of plankton are all major factors. According to Dryden, if our oceans were clean and had healthy plankton (which are one of most efficient metabolizers of CO2), they could absorb twice the CO2 they do today -(12 to 24 billion (giga) tonnes/year (current humanrelated CO2 emissions are estimated 16-17 billion (giga) tonnes per year <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Dryden, 2020)</ref>. Thus UVF pollution is only one of many factors that lead to coral bleaching and premature death.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>UVF pollution is ubiquitous</head><p>Human water sources are also affected by UV filters in the environment. Studies have shown that man-made organic UVFs, such as BP-3, OCTO, octinoxate, and ethylhexyl salicylate have been found in almost all water sources worldwide. Reviews by DiNardo and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Downs (2016</ref><ref type="bibr">Downs ( , 2017</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Schneider and Lim (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Narla and Lim (2020)</ref>, note that wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are not effective at removing these compounds due to their innate chemical properties (low water solubility, high lipophilicity, and high organic carbon-water coefficient). Ozonation is a common method of disinfection in WWTPs and has been shown to not reduce toxicity of BP-3, OMC and OC <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Hopkins et al., 2017)</ref>. WWTP influents have been shown to have BP-3 concentrations &gt; 10 ug/L in some locales <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Kim and Choi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Wu et al., 2018)</ref>. The organic filters are found in higher concentrations in urban areas, and tend to fluctuate based on the season, density of near shore beach activity and with currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Balmer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ekeghere et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Studies in marine and aquatic locations with higher density of human activity (see section 3) have also drawn attention to the possibility that UVFs can persist for a long time in water and sediments, and that tides and currents might carry them great distances to previously pristine areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Balmer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Emnet et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b163">Tang et al., 2018)</ref>. UVFs were identified in the sewage of two large Antarctic research stations, McMurdo Station and Scott Base, and the same compounds were also identified in the surrounding seawater up to 25 km away <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Emnet et al., 2014)</ref>. The presence of these UVFs is particularly concerning in the Antarctic because the environment factors (long periods of darkness, presence of sea ice, and cold temperatures) slow down microbial and photo-degradation of these compounds as well as increasing ocean temperatures that speed ice melting <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Blitz and Norton, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Emnet et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to natural water sources, organic UVFs have also been found in chlorinated water sources like swimming pools and WWTP discharges.

High throughput testing has been proposed to help with some of the toxicity studies needed for this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Erickson, 2018;</ref>.</p><p>In such a competitive market, the testing and approval processes may seem a deterrent to new product development. Gradual decreases in successive batches of the concentrations of UVF that have the most evidence of toxic effects, might lead to competitive edge for environmentally conscious manufacturers. Partnering with EU and Australian manufacturers may also help bring more eco-friendly products to the US market. We encourage the FDA to do whatever it can to help make it financially viable for manufacturers to perform the necessary testing, as well as to bring other agents (as in Europe) into the US market are part of the NDA process (a well-traveled path for pharmaceuticals entering the US).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion -call to action (opinions of the authors)</head><p>The use of sunscreen has been shown to reduce the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma by 40% and melanoma by 50% (AAD. <ref type="bibr">ORG, 2019a</ref><ref type="bibr">ORG, , 2019b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Green et al., 2011)</ref>. New legislation in Hawaii, the USVI, and other locations have begun to ban the use of certain organic UVFs in PPCPs. Currently the evolution of regulatory guidelines about sunscreen products is not keeping pace with the growing bodies of research on toxicities we have reviewed. Consequently, there is concern amongst dermatologists that a growing skepticism about certain sunscreens may lead to an overall decrease in their use <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Schwen, 2005)</ref>. To prevent this, and provide safe eco-friendly product options, it is imperative that more research on both the long term human effects and the cumulative effects on our environment, be done before deeming certain organic and/or inorganic UVFs as safe (GRASE) or unsafe for use. The AAD and FDA still recommend using sunscreen to protect the skin from UV to prevent skin cancer and photoaging. We hope that there can be better collaboration between regulatory, industry and advocacy groups to move the process forward to best provide a portfolio of safe, effective options to help protect our patients from UV damage and skin cancer, as well as protect our environment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>al., 2018; Mitchelmore et al., 2019; Tovar-Sanchez et al., 2013, 2019; Labille et al., 2020; Gou et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2018)</figDesc></figure>

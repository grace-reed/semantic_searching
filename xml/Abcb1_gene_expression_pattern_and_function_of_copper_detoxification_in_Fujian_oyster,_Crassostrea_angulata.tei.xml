				<p>Oysters are considered hyper-accumulators of Cu, but the molecular mechanism by which they maintain Cu cell homeostasis is still unclear. ATP-binding cassette protein subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1, P-glycoprotein) can transport a variety of substrates across the cell membrane in aquatic animals. In this study, to provide insight into the roles of ABCB1 in resistance against Cu in oysters, complete cDNA of abcb1 gene in Crassostrea angulata was cloned and analyzed. The complete sequence of C. angulata ABCB1 showed high identity to ABCB1 from other bivalves and contained some classical motifs of ABCB transport proteins. Abcb1 was mainly expressed in the apical epithelial cell of gills and epithelia of mantles. Abcb1 expression and Cu accumulation were also studied in control oysters and oysters exposed to Cu (30, 100, 300 μg/L Cu, 1-15 days Q4). Cu accumulation in the gill and mantle were measured after abcb1 gene interference. The complete sequence of C. angulata ABCB1 showed high identity to ABCB1 from other bivalves and contained some classical motifs of ABCB transport proteins. The mRNA transcript of abcb1 showed hypersensitivity to Cu exposure. A concentration-dependent highest abcb1 mRNA level (up to 5.61-fold to the control) in the gill and mantle existed across all Cu exposure concentrations after 3 days of Cu exposure. The gill and mantle Cu concentration were significantly higher after the abcb1 mRNA interference. According to these results, it is here speculated that ABCB1 may underlie cell protection against Cu in C. angulata.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Metal pollution has become a major environmental threat in China because of the extensive use of metals (fertilizers, materials, and metal tools) in agricultural, chemical, and industrial processes. Estuarine and coastal waters are always subject to serious pollution because they are often the sites of major economic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Pan and Wang, 2011)</ref>. One of the classic contaminated estuaries is that of Restronguet</p><p>Creek in southwest Cornwall, United Kingdom, which contains extraordinarily high metals (primarily As, Cu, and Zn) concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bryan and Langston, 1992)</ref>. Another example is the Jiulong River estuary in Fujian Province, China, which shows high metal concentrations <ref type="bibr">(Cu,</ref><ref type="bibr">223 mg/g;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ni,</ref><ref type="bibr">88</ref>.6 mg/g; and Zn, 1110 mg/g) in the sediments <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wang et al., 2011)</ref>. Cu has been toxic in these estuary environments for it is high intake. When present in excess, it can induce redox reactions that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). These free radicals can inflict direct damage to a wide range of molecules, including proteins, lipids, and DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Digiulio et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kayali and Tarhan, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Because oysters are filter feeders, they are continuously exposed to environmental pollutants. They are considered as the hyperaccumulators of various heavy metals, especially Cu, zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd).</p><p>They can accumulate dissolved copper directly by uptake through body surfaces (waterborne), while particulate metal forms can be accumulated by ingestion of contaminated food (dietborne) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wang and Fisher, 1999)</ref>. The most contaminated oysters can have a Cu body concentration as high as 14,000 μg/g dry body weight, and their tissue color becomes blue or green <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wang et al., 2011)</ref>. An oyster's ability to accumulate Cu is much greater than that of most other organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Han and Hung, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wang et al., 2011)</ref>. To survive with such high Cu concentration in their bodies, oysters have to tightly control intracellular levels of Cu. They may have developed several, probably coexisting, metal resistance mechanisms. Most of the investigations of adaptive mechanisms in oysters exposed to Cu have focused on the subcellular distribution of Cu and its ecotoxicological significance. Partitioning and sequestration are critical to the survival of the oysters with high body concentrations of <ref type="bibr">Cu (Blanchard et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pan and Wang, 2012)</ref>.

Several members of the ABC subfamily B, especially ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), can eliminate multiple toxicants from the cell through ATP-dependent processes, either directly following a toxicant's entry into the cell, or following the stages of toxicant metabolism. This protective mechanism is referred to as multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Endicott and Ling, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dean et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hackenberger et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The MXR mechanism has been shown to be the first line of defense against the environmental toxicants in several aquatic species; it works by reducing intracellular accumulation and limits any potentially toxic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kurelec, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Epel, 1998)</ref>. The expression levels of these genes, activity of putative MXR pumps, protein levels, and homology of cDNA sequences of ABC transporter genes have been investigated in a variety of marine invertebrates including worms, sponges, mollusks, daphnia, copepods, sea urchins, and coral <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Minier et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bard, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Venn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Della Torre et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cole et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Campos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jeong et al., 2014)</ref>. These studies involved many toxicants containing heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Cd), oil dispersants, hydrocarbons, and marine antifouling paints. There are some studies that have focused on the oysters: expression of ABCB1 proteins in the gills of oyster C. virginica and C. gigas; cDNA sequences and expression pattern of abcb1 in C. ariakensis and C. virginica <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Minier et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Keppler and Ringwood, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ivanina and Sokolova, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Xu et al., 2014)</ref>. Although previous studies have indicated that the MXR mechanism involves many toxicants, water temperature, and specific classes of sediment contaminants, no research has been performed on MXR in the regulation of oyster Cu homeostasis.</p><p>In this study, the complete cDNA sequence of C. angulata abcb1 gene was cloned and analyzed. The expression levels of abcb1 and accumulation of Cu in gills and mantles of C. angulata were detected after Cu exposure. Correlations between the gene expression level and dose of Cu toxicity were observed. This was done in order to establish the relationship between abcb1 expression pattern and Cu toxicity stress. The abcb1 gene situ hybridization and interference experiments were performed to provide insight into the roles that the abcb1 gene might play in Cu detoxification and maintenance of intracellular homeostasis in oysters.</p></div>

The oysters ranged in body weight from 8.0 to 13.0 g and in shell length from 45 to 58 mm. Before exposure, oysters were kept in tanks containing natural seawater and allowed to acclimate for 7 days. The seawater used in exposure experiments was filtered through sand and a 0.45 μm filter (salinity: 28‰-30‰; 26°C-28°C). The seawater was changed daily, and the oysters were fed commercial clean algal paste of Chlorella at a rate of approximately 2% of their soft tissue dry weight per day. After the acclimation, oysters were randomly divided into four groups of sixty specimens. Each group was subjected to exposure conditions</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q5</head><p>; six specimens were kept as controls (T-0 h). A stock solution of 10 mg/L Cu (CuCl 2 ; Sigma Chemical Co., U.S.) was prepared with Milli-Q-filtered water. The exposed solutions were collected at the beginning and end of the experiment. The samples were diluted with 2% analytical grade nitric acid and then the actual metal concentrations were analyzed by inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results showed that the actual Cu concentrations in the exposure experiment were within 87%-93% of the nominal concentrations. The exposure was conducted in 80 L tanks. Oysters were exposed to 30, 100, and 300 μg/L Cu, and controls were exposed to natural seawater. Each group of six individuals was randomly sampled 1, 3, 5, and 15 days after exposure. According to the previous study and our preliminary experiment, gills and mantles are the major tissues that accumulate Cu <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Luo et al., 2014)</ref>. On the other hand, Cu exposure of aqueous phase was used in this experiment. Gills and mantles were chosen as analysis targets because they made direct contactwith the water environment and absorbed Cu. The gills and mantles were 150 excised from fresh samples and washed in ice-cold saline. Each kind of tissue from one oyster was divided into two aliquots and used for measurements of Cu concentration and RNA extraction, respectively.</p><p>The tissues used for RNA extraction were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.</p></div>

Antisenseand sense-digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes were synthesized using a DIG-RNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). The fragments of abcb1 were amplified by PCR and cloned. The ligation mixture was transformed into competent cells of DH5α, which was followed by sequencing. Plasmids were used as the template to amplify the abcb1 cDNA in vitro transcription. The primers used are listed in Supplementary File 2. The probes were synthesized by transcribing with T7 RNA polymerase and digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche) using 1 μg linearized plasmid. The gill and mantle tissues of oysters were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde buffered with 1× phosphate saline (PBS: 0.8% NaCl, 0.02% KCl, 0.02 M Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 7.4) at 4°C overnight. Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were sliced on a microtome. Parts of paraffin sections were prepared for subsequent staining according to the hematoxylin-eosin protocol to illustrate the structure of the gill and mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fischer et al., 2008)</ref>. Other sections were mounted on glass slides coated with 1% poly-L-lysine solution, deparaffinized through two washes of xylene, and hydrated through an ethanol gradient.

Abcb1-RT-F and abcb1-RT-R (Supplementary File 3) were designed using the Primer Premier 5.0 based on the abcb1 238 coding region. According to a previous study, beta-actin (GenBank accession no. FJ669295) and elongation factor 1α gene (EF1α, GenBank accession no.

The PCR program was as follows: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 54°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 20 s. Melting curve analysis of amplification products was performed at the end of each PCR reaction to confirm that only one PCR product had been amplified and detected. Each sample was run in triplicate along with the internal control gene. The comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method was used to analyze the relative expression level, and fold change for the gene expression relative to the control was determined using the 2 −△△Ct method 262 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bustin et al., 2009)</ref>. The average Ct of the beta-actin and EF1α was 263 used to normalize the expression level of abcb1. The data represent the means of four to six replicates, respectively. Comparisons among the different specimens were made by one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences were accepted at P b 0.05.</p></div>

PCR fragments were sub-cloned into pMD19T-abcb1 and pMD19T-abcb3 vectors (Takara) and sequenced. pMD19T-EGFP was constructed using a 289 bp EGFP gene (GenBank accession no. EU716633) fragment from a pEGFP-N1 plasmid. All dsRNA synthesis assays were performed as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Priya et al., 2010)</ref>. All the recombinant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Then, the linearized plasmids were used to transcribe the single-stranded RNA using T7 RNA polymerases (Roche). After incubation at 37°C for h, 70°C for 10 min, and 65°C for 15 min, the DNA template was degraded by the addition of DNase I (Thermo). At last, 1 μL of RNase inhibitor was added to each of synthetic dsRNA in case it was degraded. Finally, the dsRNA was monitored with 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and NanoDrop ND-2000 (A260/A280, Thermo).</p><p>For RNAi experiments, acclimation and daily administration were the same as previously described. After acclimation, the oysters were exposure to the 10 μg/L Cu until the end of the experiment to make sure that the oysters had time to accumulate Cu. After 7 days of acclimation, 6 oysters were randomly chosen and dissected. Their gills and mantles were used for analysis to determine the initial baseline Cu concentrations. Then, 30 oysters were randomly divided into two groups (GFP control group, abcb1-dsRNA). All the dsRNA were injected into the adductor muscle every three days for a total of four times. The shells of these oysters were drilled near the adductor muscle using a microbit (1-2 mm) to facilitate dsRNA injection. The injection volume was 50 μL of saline solution and the dsRNA dose was 100 μg. Approximately 48 h after the first injection, 5 individuals that had been randomly selected from each group were dissected. Their gills and mantles were used for qRT-PCR analysis to determine the effect of the injected dsRNA. The qRT-PCR protocol was the same as that described previously and EF1α and β-actin were used as normalizers. Six individuals were randomly selected from each group, dissected, and used for Cu analysis at the end. The primers used in the experiment were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 and are presented in Supplementary File 4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Oysters have been shown to exhibit a strong tolerance to Cu exposure. It is here hypothesized that they may use a molecular detoxifica-387 tion systemthat may involve the ABC transporter superfamily. ABCB1 388 has been detected in a number of aquatic organisms, and may work by actively transporting a variety of xenobiotics across the cell membrane <ref type="bibr">(Bard, 2000)</ref>. Although the transporting activity and expression level of abcb1 in response to metals has been studied in several marine animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Achard et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ivanina and Sokolova, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Venn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zucchi et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jeong et al., 2014)</ref>, no study has specifically evaluated the role of ABCBs in Cu efflux or resistance to Cu exposure 395 in C. angulate</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q9</head><p>. In order to provide more information on ABCB1 in bivalves, especially their role in metal transposition, full-length cDNA of ABCB1 from C. angulata were identified and cloned. ABC transporters are constituted of at least two conserved regions, a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Holland et al., 2003)</ref>. The C. angulata ABCB1 contains two typical ABC transporter transmembrane domains and two ATP binding sites. This is consistent with the typical structure of other organism's ABCB transporters, such as C. ariakensis <ref type="bibr">(Ambudkar et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Luckenbach and Epel, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Xu et al., 2014)</ref>. The oyster ABCB1 diverged early during the evolution of eukaryotes, and its genes have continuously evolved. The ABCB1 proteins have strongly evolutionarily conserved regions, found in lower multiple-cell animals and higher vertebrate animals. Among different species of mammals, the ABCB1 proteins show more than 90% amino acid identity (human, Chlorocebus aethiops, Canis lupus familiaris). Unlike the mammals, the ABCB1 between the marine bivalves show major differences outside of the conservative region. For example, C. angulata ABCB1 shared 67% identity with C. gigas and 62% with Mytilus galloprovincialis. Even the C. angulata amino acids show closer to the vertebrates in some regions</p></div>

Each bar represents the mean ± SD of five specimens, β-actin and EF1 were used as the reference genes.

Abcb1 was detected in the apical epithelial cells of gills and epithelia of mantles. In previous works, ABCB1 was found on the apical border of a variety of secretory epithelia, such as kidney proximal tubules, gastrointestinal tracts, and biliary hepatocytes of several mammalian tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sarkadi et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lee et al., 2011)</ref>. Immuno-localization of ABC multidrug transporters in Indian rock oyster also showed an apical epithelial localization of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) in the gills, digestive tracts, and cytoplasmic areas of basal cells of the mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kingtong et al., 2007)</ref>. Gills and mantles are the oysters' filter-feeding tissues and they take part in respiration and secretion. They come into direct contact with the external environments and are well supplied with blood vessels, suggesting that they are the major barriers between the environments, hemolymph, and internal organs. They are also the primary tissues in oysters that take in metal contaminants <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Jing et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Luo et al., 2014)</ref>. The abcb1 gene showed considerable expression in the epithelia of gills and 434 mantles, which indicates that ABC multidrug transporters also play an 435 important role in the establishment of important biological barriers that help the organism resist environmental stress.</p><p>The current study examined the expression of abcb1 after exposure to Cu in the gills and mantles using q-PCR. The Cu concentration of the C. angulata tissues that had been exposed to Cu was then evaluated to determine the expression pattern and Cu accumulation after exposure.</p><p>Here, 300 μg/L Cu was found to be lethal to the tested oysters, with 20% mortality recorded after 15 days of exposure, while both 30 and 100 μg/L Cu exposure produced no significant difference in mortality 444 from the control group. In a previous study, C. angulata that had been exposed to 200 μg/L or more of Cu showed disorganization and apical alterations in the cilia cells, hyperplasia, lamellar fusion, and lamellar loss in the gills; hemocytic infiltration in the underlying connective tissue, and numerous brown cells not observed in control specimens (de la <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Rua et al., 2005)</ref>. This suggested that exposure to Cu at concentrations approaching the 300 μg/L disrupted cellular Cu homeostasis and caused severe damage. In this study, the Cu concentration in the gills and mantles increased in a concentration-and time-dependent manner at lower concentrations of Cu (30 and 100 μg/L). The tissue Cu burden of the high-exposure group (300 μg/L) was lower than in the moderateexposure group (100 μg/L). These findings were similar to the frequency of micronuclei in the hemocytes of the M. galloprovincialis after 4 days of Cu exposure: levels were significantly higher at 100 μg/L and a little higher at 500 μg/L <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brooks et al., 2015)</ref>. When cells and tissues were severely damaged by high Cu exposure level, less Cu was bioaccumulated.</p><p>The abcb1 mRNA expression pattern observed during the exposure phase of this study was concentration-and time-dependent. Previous studies on aquatic animals have showed that the mRNA and protein expression of ABCs increased after exposure to various metals: in reef coral exposed to Cu, in copepods exposed to Cu and Cd, and in Antarctic fish and C. virginica exposed to Cd <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ivanina and Sokolova, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Venn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zucchi et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Della Torre et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jeong et al., 2014)</ref>. This indicated that ABC efflux proteins may transport metals or their glutathione conjugates in in vitro mammalian systems and aquatic animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Leslie et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Huynh-Delerme et al., 2005</ref>). The present study showed similar results during the first stage of the Cu exposure experiment. At day 3, the highest concentration-dependent increase in gill and mantle abcb1 mRNA was observed across all Cu exposure concentrations</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Q11</head><p>. The transcript of abcb1 showed hypersensitivity to Cu exposure in C. angulata.</p><p>Significant differences were detected in the expression patterns of abcb1 among low and high Cu exposure condition at day 15. This might be related to an adaptive response that may be mediated by various mechanisms. Cu toxicity was reduced by compartmentalization, such as in the membrane-limited vesicles in oysters <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Luo et al., 2014)</ref>. Many factors may be involved in the detoxification for the exceeded Cu. Even to transport the exceeded toxins out of the cell via a membrane protein which includes not only the ABCBs but also other ABC subfamilies. The activity and expression of an ABCC/MRPtype transporter was detected in the gills of the California mussel M. californianus and in PLHC-1 fish cell line <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Luckenbach and Epel, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Della Torre et al., 2012)</ref>. ABCB1 is only one of numerous possible mechanisms. So when exposed to the low concentrations of Cu (30 μg/L), oysters quickly adapted to the challenge, and many adaptation mechanisms maintain cellular Cu homeostasis. Abcb1 mRNA levels first rose and then fell to nearly control levels at lower Cu levels. A similar observation was reported in the digestive glands of mussels and PLHC-1 fish cell line after long-term exposure to Hg 2+ : long-term exposure does not involve prolonged gene up-regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Franzellitti and Fabbri, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Della Torre et al., 2012)</ref>. However, as the concentration increases, the expression of abcb1 still remained high in groups exposed to high concentrations of Cu at day 15 (100 and 300 μg/L). The test oysters suffered extreme damage and some of them died <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Fig. 4)</ref>.</p><p>These results suggest that cellular Cu homeostasis was broken when the environmental Cu exceeded a certain threshold. Abcb1 was continuously expressed to transport Cu out of the cell, especially in surviving oysters exposed to high concentrations of Cu.</p><p>It is here speculated that Cu was one of the ABCB1 substrates. ABCB1 transporters were found to pump out Cu and play an important role in Cu detoxification.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that ABCBs can be up-regulated by compounds that induce cellular damage without actually being ABCB substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chaudhary and Roninson, 1993)</ref>. To confirm speculation that ABCB1 can transport Cu as a substrate and play an important role in the Cu detoxification, abcb1 gene interference was performed in the present study. The Cu enrichment levels of the gills and mantle were significantly higher after abcb1 gene interference. The transcription level of abcb1 affected the accumulation of Cu in C. angulata. Some studies in invertebrate animals showed ABCB1 to have similar functions in response to metal exposure. For example, the transport activity of the ABCB1 protein indicated by rhodamine fluorescence was triggered by excess metal intake in Tigriopus japonicas. ABCB1's ability to remove metal was tested in Drosophila melanogaster and soil nematodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Broeks et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Callaghan and Denny, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jeong et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>These results suggested that when ABCB1 is inhibited, copper efflux is also weakened.

The RNA were treated with DNase I 169 (Invitrogen) to remove possible contaminating DNA. Then, 1 μg of 170 total RNA from each tissue was used as a template for the reverse transcription reaction with a Prime Script II first-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit 172 (Takara, China). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized and used as the 173 template for further PCR analysis. 174 Based on the conserved sequence of abcb1 gene from Crassostrea gigas (GenBank accession no. XM_011414311), the partial cDNA fragment of abcb1 from C. angulata was cloned and re-sequenced. To obtain the full-length cDNA of abcb1, both 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE and 3′-RACE) were conducted with the 5′-Full RACE Kit and 3′-Full RACE Core Set Ver. 2.0 (Takara, Dalian, China) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, respectively.

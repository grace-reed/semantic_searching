			<abstract>
				<p>The present report describes a comprehensive study on comparative biochemical characterization of two lysosomal enzymes, acid phosphatase and β-hexosaminidase in three different strains of Hydra; Hydra vulgaris Ind-Pune, H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal and H. magnipapillata sf-1 (self-feeder-1). Since morphology and habitat of Hydra effect lysosomal enzymes and their response to environmental pollutants, it would be interesting to identify them in different Hydra strains so as to use them as toxicity testing. Preliminary studies revealed a differential expression of acid phosphatase, β-hexosaminidase and β-glucuronidase in three Hydra strains. Expression of all three lysosomal enzymes in H. vulgaris Ind-Pune was low in comparison to H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal and H. magnipapillata sf-1, while their expression is comparable in H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal and H. magnipapillata sf-1. The Michaelis-Menten (K M) values for lysosomal β-hexosaminidase using 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide as substrate were found to be 1.3 mM, 1.1 mM and 0.8 mM, respectively for H. vulgaris Ind-Pune, H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal and H. magnipapillata sf-1. For acid phosphatase using 4-nitrophenyl-phosphate as substrate, the K M values were 0.38 mM, 1.2 mM and 0.52 mM respectively, for H. vulgaris Ind-Pune, H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal and sf-1 strains. The optimum temperature for β-hexosaminidase was 60°C for H. vulgaris Ind-Pune, while 50°C was observed for H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal and sf-1 strains. The optimum pH for β-hexosaminidase was found to be 6.0 for H. vulgaris Ind-Pune and H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal, and 5.0 for sf-1. The optimum temperature and pH of acid phosphatase was similar in all three strains, viz., 40°C and 3.0, respectively. Preliminary localization studies using whole mount in situ hybridization revealed predominant endodermal expression of three enzymes in H. vulgaris Ind-Pune. Our results thus support the conservation of lysosomal hydrolases in Hydra. 1. Introduction The degradative functions of the cell are carried out by specialized organelles called lysosomes. Lysosomal hydrolases degrade extra cellular molecules; pathogens internalized by endocytosis or phagocytosis, and also aid in the turnover of intracellular proteins and maintain the cellular homeostasis and differentiation (Stoka et al., 2016; de Marcos Lousa and Denecke, 2016). Further, lysosomal enzymes also show important roles in tissue remodeling, membrane repair, cell adhesion, immune function, pigmentation, and signaling. Specially, lysosomal acid phosphatases, β-glucuronidase, acid sphingomyelinase, and proteases such as cathepsins, participate in tissue repair, dedifferentiation, aging, immune response, and other processes. Acid phosphatases in the vertebrates are a distinct family of enzymes that cause hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters at an acidic pH of 3.0-5.0. Different types of acid phosphatases have been identified till date, based on their structure, catalytic and immunological properties, cellular localization and tissue distribution (Suter et al., 2001). Lysosomal acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2, LAP), a ubiquitously expressed enzyme is often considered as a key biochemical marker enzyme for lysosomes (De Duve, 1983). Synthesized as a membrane-bound precursor with 7-8 N-linked oligosaccharides, a transmembrane domain</p>

Once the precursor enzyme reaches lysosomes, it is proteolytically processed in the lysosomal matrix and a mature LAP is released <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gottschalk et al., 1989)</ref>. Though LAP is majorly localized to lysosomes in different organs, other forms of soluble acid phosphatase, specifically expressed and secreted in the prostate gland have also been identified. Both LAP and prostate acid phosphatases are glycoproteins and contain mannose and glucosamine in the carbohydrate moiety, show identical subunits of molecular weight of 48-52 kDa, and are sensitive to L-tartrate inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lemansky et al., 1985)</ref>. Subsequently, a tartrate resistant type-5 acid phosphatase (Acp5), an orthophosphoric monoesterase has also been identified in lysosomal compartments of mononuclear phagocytes and osteoclasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hayman et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bevilacqua et al., 1991)</ref>. Absence of either of these acid phosphatases, LAP/Acp5 leads to mild phenotypes, suggesting partial compensatory mechanisms by the other phosphatase. However, deficiency of both phosphatases (LAP/Acp5) leads to abnormal lysosomal storage in soft and mineralized tissues.</p><p>Another equally important lysosomal enzyme includes β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52, Hex), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal N-acetylhexosamine residues from the non-reducing ends of glycoconjugates <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Venugopal and Sivakumar, 2013)</ref>. Three isozymes of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase composed of two subunits, α and β are commonly identified: Hex A (α-β), Hex B (β-β), and Hex S (α-α). Hex A and Hex B are functionally more significant, while Hex S is a minor form and shows less activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hepbildikler et al., 2002)</ref>. Both Hex A and Hex B are synthesized as precursors and are transported to lysosomes and depend on the recognition of mannose residues by mannose phosphate receptors. Deficiency of Hex A leads to Tay-Sachs disease, while deficiency of both isozymes, Hex A and B causes Sandhoff disease. In addition to these three isozymes, a relatively less known βhexosaminidase, HexD, encoded by HexDC gene also exists <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gutternigg et al., 2009)</ref>. However, the function of this nuceocytoplasmic localized enzyme is not clearly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alteen et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Several reports have demonstrated the role of LAP and Hex during regeneration. Coward and his group <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Coward et al., 1973)</ref> have demonstrated an increase in LAP activity during planarian regeneration. LAP activity was also found to be high during tail regeneration in lizards <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alibardi, 1998)</ref> and in tail regression during metamorphosis in Xenopus tadpoles <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Robinson, 1970</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Robinson, , 1972</ref>. Role of LAP in dedifferentiation, a condition prerequisite for limb regeneration was also detected in the adult urodele <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Miller and Wolfe, 1968)</ref>. Biochemical and immunohistochemical investigations also have demonstrated a prominent increase of LAP activity during retinoic acid mediated limb regeneration and dedifferentiation in regenerating salamander larvae <ref type="bibr">Kim, 1994, 2004)</ref>. Similarly, role of hexosaminidase during regeneration has been well demonstrated. Role in chitin degradation by hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds of 2-acetamido 2-deoxy β-D-glycosides, along with chitinases in invertebrates has been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cohen, 2009)</ref>. Role of N-acetyl β-D-hexosaminidase (N-acetylglucusoaminidase and N-acetylgalactosaminidase) during dedifferentiation in the first 24 h of regenerating planarians has also been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pascolini et al., 1981)</ref>. These results point towards the involvement of lysosomal hydrolases in regeneration, tissue remodeling and differentiation.</p><p>Our laboratory mainly focuses on delineation of lysosomal biogenesis pathway in vertebrates and invertebrates. Previous reports from our laboratory have established the evolutionary conservation of lysosomal enzymes as well as their sorting receptors from molluscs to vertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kumar and Bhamidimarri, 2015)</ref>. Recently we have also identified lysosomal hydrolases and mannose-6 phosphate receptor dependent lysosomal targeting system for the first time in a simple diploblastic Cnidarian, 'Hydra' <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bhamidimarri et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In order to understand the evolutionary conservation of lysosomal enzymes and their biogenesis pathway, particularly in the Cnidarians, it is important to carry out a systematic study on the enzymes and their biochemical nature. These studies would eventually allow us to establish the conservation of lysosomal biogenesis in the animal kingdom. Hydra, a fresh water Cnidarian, has been used as a powerful model system in biology to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying different processes such as wound healing, regeneration, immune response and autophagy. Presence of unique features, such as, remarkable power of regeneration, absence of cellular senescence and maintenance of axial polarity, has resulted in using Hydra as a suitable model to study morphogenesis and pattern formation. Since lysosomal enzymes play crucial roles in various physiological and stressed conditions, Hydra can act as a powerful experimental model to study their involvement during tissue remodeling and regeneration. Further, the availability of RNA seq analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Wenger et al., 2019)</ref> and identification of molecular map and differentiation trajectories of specific lineages would help in elucidating developmental mechanisms at single-cell level in response to environmental and experimental perturbations <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Siebert et al., 2019)</ref>. The ready availability of different strains of 'Hydra' in our laboratory also has prompted us to look more closely into the details of various lysosomal enzyme activities in each strain. Since each of them was obtained from three different habitats, it is expected that these strains express different levels of enzymes and may respond differently to environmental pollutants. Hence it is interesting to identify the differences, if any, in the lysosomal enzyme activities in these strains and may help in using them as potential toxicological indicators.</p><p>In the present paper we characterized two lysosomal hydrolases, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and acid phosphatase biochemically and carried out comparative analysis among three different strains of Hydra, Hydra vulgaris Ind-Pune, H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal and H. magnipapillata sf-1. H. vulgaris Ind-Pune and H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal are distinct Indian strains belonging to the 'vulgaris' group of hydra. Though, both strains belong to same 'vulgaris' species, they show significant morphological and taxonomical variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Londhe et al., 2017)</ref>. H. magnipapillata sf-1 is a temperature sensitive mutant strain of Japanese H. magnipapillata that grows normally at 18°C, while at restrictive temperatures, at 28°C or more, the polyps loses interstitial stem cells when maintained for 8-10 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sugiyama and Fujisawa, 1978)</ref>. In this paper, we report comparative analysis of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and acid phosphatase in three Hydra strains, which showed significant differences in their biochemical properties. This suggests possible differences in their cellular and tissue makeup and may thus point towards their differences in physiological adaptations to the external environment.</p></div>

About 1000 whole polyps of each strain were washed separately in 0.9% saline and centrifuged briefly to collect the polyps. From these, soluble proteins were extracted by standard protocol as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bhamidimarri et al., 2018)</ref>. Briefly, polyps were lysed in lysis buffer (0.5 M sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM iodoacetic acid and 1 mM PMSF), in a probe sonicator with 30/60 s on/off pulse cycle for three times.

Kinetic parameters K M and Vmax values were calculated by Michaelis-Menten plots using Graph Pad Prism7 software.</p><p>2.6. Isolation and cloning of β-hexosaminidase, acid phosphatase and βglucuronidase from hydra and sequence analysis Prior to RNA isolation, the polyps were starved for 48 h, and the RNA was isolated from the 30-40 polyps by Trizol method according to manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). About 1 μg of the RNA was used to synthesize cDNA by first-stand cDNA synthesis kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Gene specific primers <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref> for complete coding sequence for β-hexosaminidase, acid phosphatase and β-glucuronidase were designed based on H. magnipapillata genome, and the genes were amplified from H. vulgaris Ind-Pune. In order to prepare riboprobes for in situ hybridization, partial coding sequences were amplified using a second set of primers <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. The conditions used for PCR were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 52°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 1 min (35 cycles), and the final extension was at 72°C for 10 min. The amplified products were cloned into pGEMT easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and confirmed by sequencing. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by ML, NJ and MP methods using MEGAX. Bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates was carried out for each tree with random addition of sequences for 10 replicates.</p></div>

The plasmid vectors containing the inserts of βhexosaminidase and acid phosphatase, digoxygenin labeled nucleotides, T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases (Roche, Germany) were used to synthesize DIG labeled sense and antisense riboprobes by in vitro transcription. A standard protocol was employed for in situ hybridization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Krishnapati and Ghaskadbi, 2013)</ref>. Briefly, starved polyps (36-48 h) were relaxed in 2% urethane and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. Fixed polyps were permeabilized with proteinase K (10 mg/ml) at room temperature for 10 min. DIG labeled probes, both sense (control) and antisense were incubated with polyps for 48 h at 60°C followed by stringency washes (0.5× SSC + 0.1% CHAPS). Antidigoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was added and incubated at 4°C overnight. Maleic acid buffer (100 mM maleic acid pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) was used to remove unbound antibody. Staining of the polyps was done by nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate p-toluidine salt (NBT/BCIP) (Roche, Germany) substrates. Upon color development, polyps were transferred to methanol followed by imaging using Olympus SZX16 microscope.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Existence of lysosomal enzymes and their sorting receptors in several invertebrate species, including Starfish, Unio and Hydra have been identified from our laboratory. However, detailed studies on the lysosomal enzymes in lower invertebrates are scarce and evidences on the evolutionary conservation of lysosomal biogenesis in them have not been clearly demonstrated. Here, we present the first report on the comparative analysis of lysosomal enzymes in three different strains of Hydra. Due to its simple, bilayered nature, Hydra can be used as biological indicators to evaluate the presence of contaminants in the medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Holdway et al., 2001</ref>; Patwardhan and Ghaskadbi, 2013). Due to the differences in the morphology and habitat, many species of Hydra respond differently to a wide range of environmental pollutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Karntanut and Pascoe, 2002)</ref>. For example, the two Hydra species, H. vulgaris and H. viridissima, showed differences in their sensitivities <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.

In order to better understand the activities of lysosomal acid hydrolases, we have identified and characterized two enzymes, β-hexosaminidase and acid phosphatase, biochemically from H. vulgaris Ind-Pune, H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal and H. magnipapillata sf-1, and cloned the genes coding for lysosomal acid phosphatase and βglucuronidase, and a nucleocytoplasmic β-hexosaminidase from H. vulgaris Ind-Pune. Initial lysosomal enzyme analysis from the soluble extracts of H. vulgaris Ind-Pune showed predominant levels of β-hexosaminidase, acid phosphatase and β-glucuronidase as compared to other lysosomal enzymes. It is known that the activities of the glycosidases vary from species to species and also differ based on their diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Profeta et al., 2017)</ref>, thus it is expected that the activities of these enzymes, hexosaminidase and acid phosphatase may differ in the three strains of Hydra. Further, it is also important to note that the activities of glycosidase and hydrolase also vary with incubation time and temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Milanesi and Bird, 1972)</ref>.</p><p>At the cellular level, lysosomes are the major organelles that undergo changes due to the toxic effects of many contaminants. They include changes in lysosomal contents and swelling and an increase in lysosomal hydrolase activities can be used as reliable tools to assess environmental contaminants <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dailianis, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jing et al., 2006a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Moore et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">P Jayakumar and Paul, 2007)</ref>. Further, the stability of lysosomes can also be assessed by the latent lysosomal activity of the enzymes, N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase, β-glucuronidase and acid phosphatase <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Moore et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">P Jayakumar and Paul, 2007)</ref>. With an aim to use different Hydra strains as promising biological indicators in freshwater contamination assessment, the activities of two marker enzymes, β-hexosaminidase and acid phosphatase were compared. From the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3A</ref>, it is interesting to see the differences in the β-hexosaminidase activity with respect to pH, where optimum activity was observed at pH 6.0 in H. vulgaris Ind-Pune and H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal, while in H. magnipapillata sf-1, it was observed to be at 5.0. Being an acid hydrolase, β-hexosaminidase showed maximum activity at an acidic pH, and many of the hexosaminidases show maximum activity at an acidic pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Venugopal and Sivakumar, 2013)</ref>. Surprisingly, no difference was observed in the pH optima of acid phosphatase in all three strains, though some of the acid phosphatases showed maximum activity in the pH range of 3-5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jing et al., 2006a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mazorra et al., 2002)</ref>. When temperature optima were investigated, β-hexosaminidase exhibited maximum activity at 60°C in H. vulgaris Ind-Pune, whereas at 50°C in H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal and H. magnipapillata sf-1. It has been previously reported that glycosidases show maximum activity at higher temperatures in invertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Venugopal and Sivakumar, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Venugopal and Siva Kumar, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Venugopal et al., 2017)</ref>. On the other hand it is interesting to notice that acid phosphatase showed no difference for optimum pH (3) and temperature (40°C) for activity in all three strains of Hydra. Acid phosphatase, an inducible lysosomal enzyme, can be altered by the presence of xenobiotics and heavy metals, and is widely used as a biomarker, a potential indicator for assessing the impact of heavy metal pollutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jing et al., 2006a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jing et al., , 2006b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mazorra et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">P Jayakumar and Paul, 2007)</ref>, and its increased activity was always associated with the damage of lysosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Jing et al., 2006b)</ref>. Hence both these enzymes (hexosaminidase and acid phosphatase) can be used as tools in environmental pollution assessment.</p><p>Both enzymes showed different affinities towards the 4-nitrophenylconjugated synthetic substrate in the three Hydra strains. The affinity (0.8 mM) of H. magnipapillata β-hexosaminidase was more as compared to other two strains, whereas the affinity of β-hexosaminidase from H. vulgaris Ind-Pune and H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal were almost similar with K M values 1.3 mM and 1.1 mM respectively. Interestingly, acid phosphatase from H. vulgaris Naukuchiatal showed less affinity towards 4nitrophenylphosphate with a K M value of 1.2 mM, whereas the affinity of acid phosphatase from H. vulgaris Ind-Pune and H. magnipapillata sf-1 showed similar affinity towards 4-nitrophenylphosphate with a respective K M values of 0.38 mM and 0.52 mM. This differential affinity of both enzymes from three different hydra strains could be attributed to differential expression of the enzyme in these strains, where the expression of enzymes is further dependent on the ecological habitat of the animals.</p><p>In silico analysis of Hydra lysosomal enzymes revealed presence of characteristic domains. In case of β-hexosaminidase, conservation of GH20 catalytic domain was observed suggesting that the identified gene is indeed a β-hexosaminidase. However, a further analysis by PSI-BLAST and Delta BLAST revealed that hydra β-hexosaminidase could possibly is a HexD. Previous reports showed conservation of active site amino acids, aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E) at positions 148 and 149 respectively in HexD, and are responsible for binding the substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alteen et al., 2016)</ref>. Analysis of Hydra peptide sequence also showed the presence of 'D' at position 148, suggesting the conservation of active site in Hydra. However, the enzyme lacks 'E' at position 149 and is replaced by a basic amino acid, 'K'. Translated amino acid sequence of hydra acid phosphatase revealed the presence of a phosphohistidine signature <ref type="bibr">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr">(33)</ref> at the N-terminus and an active site signature (269-285) at the C-terminus, which shows a conserved 'Histidine' residue at the center of each signature, responsible for the enzyme catalytic mechanism. This confirms that the hydra acid phosphatase belongs to the histidine acid phosphatase super family. Further, mass spectroscopic analysis of the expressed hydra acid phosphatase protein strongly suggests its close relatedness to the human enzyme (unpublished data). Similarly, Hydra β-glucuronidase showed a highly conserved glutamic acid residue that acts as a signature pattern (433-447) for family 2 Glycosyl hydrolases confirming the conservation of key motifs in the active site responsible for enzyme catalysis.</p><p>Whole mount in situ hybridization studies revealed predominant expression of β-hexosaminidase, acid phosphatase and β-glucuronidase in the endoderm layer. In Hydra, the endoderm, also called gastroderm lines the surface of the gastric cavity and is mainly made up of flagellated endodermal epithelial cells. Previous studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have shown localization of acid phosphatase in the intestinal epithelium and its role in gut differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beh et al., 1991)</ref>. Reports show that G20 glycoside hydrolases can function as chitinases due to their ability to cleave β-(1,4)-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues directly from the non-reducing ends of chitin polymers and chitin oligomers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Scigelova and Crout, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">LeCleir et al., 2007)</ref>. High expression of N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase in intestinal mucosal tissues with active turnover has also been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pascolini et al., 1981)</ref>. Hydra are often fed with crustacean larvae, artemia under laboratory conditions, while in natural environment, they feed on small aquatic insects such as daphnia, cyclops, etc. both of which are crustaceans. Since chitin acts as an important structural component of cell wall of many insects, it is highly expected that chitin degrading enzymes are expressed in the gastroderm of hydra. Similarly, β-glucuronidase cleaves β-D-glucuronic acid residues from the non-reducing ends of glycosaminoglycans. Function of β-glucuronidase in xenobiotic metabolism in the digestive tract of humans has been demonstrated. Similarly, role in digestion in invertebrate species has been demonstrated. Predominant expression of β-glucuronidase in the endoderm of Hydra thus suggests its possible role in digestion. Our current localization results thus show the presence of both β-hexosaminidase and β-glucuronidase in the gastroderm suggesting their possible role in degrading the GlcNAc residues during digestion.</p><p>In summary, a comparative analysis of three important lysosomal enzymes, from three different strains of 'Hydra' has been reported for the first time. Results obtained in this study are in agreement with our recent findings on the lysosomal activities from H. vulgaris Ind-Pune. A significant difference in the expression levels of acid phosphatase, βhexosaminidase and glucuronidase across the three strains of Hydra was observed. Among these, significant difference was observed in the properties of β-hexosaminidase in the three Hydra strains. In addition, a differential affinity of β-hexosaminidase and acid phosphatase towards the chromogenic substrates was also observed. Whole mount in situ experiments revealed possible role of these enzymes in digestion. Further studies on protein sequencing and functional studies of these enzymes should conclusively establish and confirm on the evolutionary conservation of these important enzymes.</p></div>

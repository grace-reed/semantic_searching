<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Evidence has recently been presented for the reversibility of the thrombin-induced polymerization of fibrinogen (I). The equilibria involved may be represented as nf 2 f,</p><p>mf, s fibrin <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3)</ref> where T represents thrombin, F is fibrinogen, f is an "activated" or polymerizable form of fibrinogen (a), P is fibrinopeptide (3), f, is an intermediate polymer (4), n is some variable number <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5)</ref>, and m is also some number.</p><p>This paper is concerned primarily with the polymerization process (steps 2 and 3).6 The reversibility of step 2 has already been demonstrated by flow birefringence measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(8)</ref> 6 The polymerization off in the presence of calcium and serum factor is another reaction (6,7) which does not concern us here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>370</head><p>DONNELLY, LASKOWSKI, NOTLEY AND SCHERAGA scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(9)</ref>. However, some question has been raised (10) about the reversibility of step 3 because of the fact that it previously had not been found possible to separate fibrin into partially polymerized fragments, f n. Since f, was not heretofore detectable in solutions of dissolved fibrin, it was thought that fibrin could be dissolved appreciably only in dissociating solvents so that a solution of virtually depolymerized fragments f would necessarily result <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(10)</ref>. It was also suggested (10) that step 3 is not "truly" reversible, but can be reversed only with simultaneous, complete reversal of step 2. Therefore, we are presenting evidence here that fibrin can be depolymerized to produce f, , i.e., that step 3 is "truly" reversible.</p><p>Further, a mechanism of polymerization will be presented by elaborating on our previous suggestion (5) that step 2 represents a series of equilibria among many species f, , with hydrogen bonding playing an important role in all three steps of the clotting process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>Fibrinogen stock solutions were prepared by refractionation of Armour bovine fraction I according to the procedure of Laki (2), followed by dissolution in, and dialysis against, the appropriate solvent for the experiment under consideration. The Laki procedure gives preparations which are at least 95% clottable, as determined by his method <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(2)</ref>. The concentration of clottable protein was determined by Morrison's procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(11)</ref>.</p><p>The highly purified bovine thrombin used throughout this work was graciously supplied by Dr. W. H. Seegers of Wayne University.</p><p>All other materials were analytical reagent grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation of Fibrin</head><p>Solutions of dissolved fibrin were prepared by a modification of the method6 of Lorand and Middlebrook <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(12)</ref>. Making use of the observations of Shulman, Katz, and Ferry (13) that fibrin is soluble in concentrated NaBr solutions, the solubility was investigated as a function of NaBr concentration and pH. A convenient medium for high solubility of fibrinogen (at least 70/o) and fibrin (of the order of 2-3%) was found to be 1 M NaBr at pH 5.2-5.3. Under these conditions the soluble 6 It might be pointed out here that this work was carried out in conjunction with studies of the equilibrium in step 1, where soluble fibrin is also required. Since this equilibrium is being investigated by nitrogen analyses, the procedure of <ref type="bibr">Lorand and Middlebrook (12)</ref>, involving dissolution in urea, is not suitable for this purpose. Hence, a solvent was used (1 M NaBr) which did not contain nitrogen. The slow solution process is greatly accelerated by constant, gentle (e.g., magnetic) stirring. To purif) the dissolved fibrin further, it was reclotted by again diluting the NaBr solution by a factor of 20, as above, with the same phosphate buffer (but containing no added thrombin).</p><p>The fibrin clot thus formed was collected as before, the entire cycling process of dissolution and reprecipitation being carried out three times. The final solution of fibrin dissolved in 1 M NaBr at pH</p><p>., species f) was then dialyzed against a solution of 1 M NaBr at pH 5.3, the dialysis serving to define the pH and NaBr concentration.</p><p>Similarly, fibrin (clotted at pH 6.3) was dissolved in concentrated NaBr at pH 6.0-6.1 to give a mixture of species f and f, at a final NaBr concentration of 1 M. During the dissolution process tht, pH was lowered about 0.2 pH unit to 6.1 by addition of phosphate buffer since pH 6.2 is an approximate upper limit for the inhibition of further polymerization of f, in 1 M h'aBr.</p><p>It may be noted that f can be converted to a mixture of f and f,, , and vice versa, simply by changing the pH back and forth between 5.3 and 6.1, demonstrnt,. ing the already proven result (8, 9) that step 2 is reversible. Since our experiments were carried out in conjunction with a simultaneous investigation6 of step 1 (in which F and f were intentionally heat denatured in 6 M urea), the electrophoresis results reported here pertain to the denatured proteins which are unaggregated <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(17)</ref>. Prior to electrophoresis, the urea-denatured proteins were dialyzed against a solution consisting of 6 M urea and an acetate buffer, 0.1 M in sodium acetate, pH 5.55.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light Scattering</head><p>The light-scattering apparatus used has been described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(18)</ref>. It has previously been shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">19)</ref> that concentration effects and depolarization effects need not be considered in the systems studied here. Measurements were made over the angular range of 30" to 135", with respect to the incident beam, using light of wavelength 4358 A. Appropriate corrections were made for scattering volume and polarization, and for cell imperfections at angles below 40". Fluorescein was used for the calibration.</p><p>We are concerned here with only the weight-average degree of polymerization of the intermediate polymers, and therefore do not need to know the molecular weight of the monomer. The weight-average degree of polymerization is simply the ratio of the intensity of the excess light scattered at zero angle for the solution of intermediate polymers to that for fibrinogen at the same protein concentration, assuming the refractive increment to be independent of the degree of polymerization and the second virial coefficient to be zero for all species.</p><p>Solutions and solvents were centrifuged at 12,500 r.p.m. at 15°C. in a Sorvall refrigerated high-speed centrifuge for 5 hr. The light-scattering cell was then filled and left at room temperature for 6 hr. before measurement to allow thermal and chemical equilibrium to be attained. After 6 hr., the scattering from dissolved fibrin, at each concentration, reached a steady value. This time-dependence has been reported previously for inhibited thrombin-fibrinogen mixtures <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(9)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activation Process (Production of j)</head><p>Before polymerization can take place, thrombin must convert F to f; i.e., t'he proteolytic (or activation) process of step 1 makes available the functional groups required for the polymerization of steps 2 and 3. Nitrogen analyses carried out in this laboratory have demonstrated that the fibrinopeptide, which Lorand found in clot supernatants (3), is formed in step 1, which appears to be reversible. These analyses have been carried out on fibrinogen-thrombin mixtures in solvents for which hydrodynamic methods have shown that polymerization (i.e., steps 2 and S) does not talce place. Such solvents are 0.3 M KC1 at pH 5.0, 2 M NaBr at pH 5.6, and 1 M NaBr at pH 5.3. Of these, the 1 M NaBr has been found to be the most satisfactory from the point of view of high solubility and absence of denaturation. The absence of polymerization in this solvent was indicated by ultracentrifugal and flow birefringence measurements (see <ref type="figure">Figs. 1B and 2</ref>). The fact that proteolysis (the con- version of F to f in step 1) has taken place is indicated by accumulation of peptide as reaction proceeds, the presence of the peptide being followed by nitrogen analyses on the supernatant liquid remaining after T, F, and f have been precipitated with trichloroacetic acid.7 As found earlier by Laki (2), the sedimentation behavior of F and f are identical; the release of t'he fibrinopeptide in step 1 presumably does not appreciably affect hhe sedimentation propert'ies. Similarly, flow birefringence measurements on F and f indicate no difference between these two species (SW <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activated Fibrinogen, f</head><p>Before discussing the polymerization of f it is worth noting that the procedure used for dissolving fibrin in 1 M KaBr at pH 5.3 makes available preparat,ions of f which are being used bo study the reversal of  the proteolytic reaction in step 1, and also to study the kinetics and equilibria involved in steps 2 and 3 without complications from step 1. While sedimentation experiments cannot distinguish between F and f (2), these species are distinguishable by their electrophoretic mobility. Electrophoresis runs were made on urea-denatured F, f, and a mixture of the two. The mobilities of F and f are different, and the two components were resolvable. By this electrophoretic criterion, the f-material prepared by dissolving fibrin in 1 M NaBr at pH 5.3, is seen to differ from F, presumably, of course, by virtue of the fact that I? has been split off. Such differences in electrophoretic behavior of F and f dissolved in urea, but not denatured, were shown previously by Mihalyi <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(16)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reversibility of Xtep 3</head><p>Partial polymerization (i.e., step 2) can take place in 1 M NaBr at pH 5.6-6.1 without the reaction proceding all the way toward fibrin formation. Within 3-6 hr. after the addition of thrombin to fibrinogen under these conditions, the sedimentation pattern (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1C</ref>) is similar to that reported for hexamethylene glycol-inhibited clotting systems by Shulman and Ferry <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(4)</ref>, and also to that previously found for unin-hibited systems (5); i.e., one observes the presence of two distinct peaks, one supposedly corresponding to F + f, and the other to the heavier intermediate polymer f, . If fibrin, dissolved in 1 M NaBr at pH 5.3 is brought to pH 6.1, then the same ultracentrifugal pattern results in much shorter time (half-time 4-10 min.8) because the slow step does not have to take place. Also, in this case the slow peak would probably be free of F.</p><p>Flow-birefringence experiments also indicate the nature of the polymerization process of step 2 (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). In jibrinogen solutions at pH 5.3-5.8, the curve of extinction angle, x vs. velocity gradient, G, is independent of pH. -4 solution of fibrinogen and thrombin incubated at pH 5.3 for about 60 hr. (and, therefore, at equilibrium7 with respect to step 1 and containing an appreciable amount of f) shows the same x vs. G behavior, in agreement with the conclusion from sedimentat,ion that F and f are similar. Also, it is seen that st,eps 2 and 3 do not occur at pH 5.3 in 1 M NaBr at this concentration. As already pointed out', nitrogen analyses indicate that st'ep 1 tloes proceed at. this PH. If the pH of a fibrinogen-thrombin mixture is raised to 5.6 or to 5.7, the x vs. G curve decreases morerapidlyas found previously <ref type="bibr">(8, 201,</ref> showing the presence of intermediate polymers f,, .</p><p>The presence of intermediate polymers f, can be demonstrated by approaching this state from the reverse direction. If fibrin is dissolved with gentle, magnetic stirring in 1 M NaBr at pH 5.7-6.1, the same sedimentation behavior is observed as in thrombin-fibrinogen mixtures in 1 M NaBr at pH 5.7-6.1. This has been shown for fibrin which was originally clotsted at. pH 6.3 in the buffer used in the purification procedure (  <ref type="figure">Fig. 1C</ref> for an (F + T) incubated solution. It is, therefore, shown that step 3 of the reaction scheme is also "tr.uly" reversibb. The pH dependence of some of these effects has been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5)</ref>. 1.0 5.6 9.9 0 F + T was incubated at pH 6.1 for 4 hr. by which time the f, peak had appeared. An aliquot of this solution was then brought to pH 5.3, the sedimentation pattern of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B</ref> being obtained. Similar patterns were observed for fibrin dissolved at pH 5.3, and for fibrin dissolved at pH 6.1 but then brought to pH 5.3. In the cases where this sedimentation pattern is obtained from dissolved fibrin, it presumably represents pure f.</p><p>b This mixture was incubated for 6 hr. before running in the ultracentrifuge. One can place rough limits on pH and concentration for the appearance of one or two peaks in the ultracentrifugal pattern. Below 0.4 % at pH 5.7-5.8, only one peak is present. The second peak appears if the pH and/or t,he concentration is raised. Above pH 6.3 and 0.5 %, the system gels (step 3). It must be remembered that these limits apply only to this 1 M NaBr system, and would probably be altered by changes in the NaBr concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light-Xcattering Observations on Step 2</head><p>With the availability of solutions of f, some observations were made of the equilibrium of step 2 by determining the weight-average degree of polymerization, (Op), , by means of light scattering. Stock solutions of dissolved fibrin (in 1 M NaBr at pH 5.9) were diluted to various total protein concentrations, c, and light-scattering measurements carried out, as already described, after equilibrium was attained. These solutions would differ from those studied by Ferry and co-workers (9) in that step 1 is not involved in our systems and the concentration of F if negligible. The observat!ions are, therefore, presumably made on a system containing various polymers f, in equilibrium with each other, where n is 1, 2, 3 . . ,, etc.</p><p>The scattering curves are very similar to those obtained by Ferry and co-workers (9), as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> for a particular solution where t,he total protein concentration is 0.239 g./lOO cc. The dependence of (r~), on c is also qualitatively similar. In determining (BP), we have made use of previous observations (9, 19) that the 2nd virial coefficients are zero in such systems, and, therefore, that (Dp), is determinable from measurements at a single concentration. The linear portions of t'he scattering curves at low angles were extrapolated to zero angle to compute (B),</p><p>, the values of which are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table II</ref>. Accepting now the reversibility of steps 1, 2, and 3 of the fibrinogenfibrin conversion, we may discuss some of the more detailed interactions involved in these steps.</p><p>In step 1, P represents an acidic peptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(21)</ref>, and possibly more than one peptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(22)</ref>, which is split off from fibrinogen, F. Unpublished results from our laboratory indicate that the equilibrium constant is unusually small, especially when compared to the hydrolysis of simple peptides; i.e., in step 1 the equilibrium does not predominate far to the right as it does in simple peptides. Therefore, step 1 must involve some additional process besides the splitting of one or more peptide bonds.9 It is reasonable to assume (24) that a number of hydrogen bonds between the polar R groups of P and those of the main portion of F are also broken during the proteolysis of step 1. Quantitative estimates of the additional free energy involved in breaking such hydrogen bonds (24) account for the apparent stability of the peptide bond(s) being split; i.e., in order to liberate P in a proteolytic reaction it is necessary to break not only a peptide bond but also a number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds which existed between P and f before proteolysis. Since P contains a large number of carboxyl side groups (21) these would be ionized in the pH range of interest (&gt; 5.0) and could function as acceptors, being initially combined in hydrogen-bonding interactions with a number of tyrosyl, lysyl, and a-amino groups on f to make up the F molecule.</p><p>When P is split off, the donor groups on the f monomer are uncovered and can serve as functional groups for polymerization of f to f, and fibrin by a hydrogen-bonding interaction if any free acceptor sites are available on other f molecules. Considerable evidence exists to indicate that fibrin clots are held together by hydrogen bonds6 rather than by less specific electrostatic forces. For example, fibrin clots are readily soluble in solvents which break hydrogen bonds (urea and concentrated NaBr), and also are easily depolymerized by heating.</p><p>It has been suggested by <ref type="bibr">Shulman and Ferry (25)</ref> that histidyl groups are involved in the polymerization process. Sets of histidyl groups on f monomers could well furnish the acceptor sites for the donors liberated in step 1 (tyrosyl, lysyl, a-amino groups) and thus lead to polymeriza-tion.'O This mechanism would also account for the pH dependence of the clotting time <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(25)</ref>  It is clear from the fact that fibrin rlots are formed (i.e., that8 threedimensional networks exist) that f is more than bifunctional, i.e., that it rontains more than one donor and one acceptor site." Thus, highly hypothetical schematic diagrams of f and F are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, assuming t'hat two peptides PI and Pp can be split off from F. When PI and Pz are liberated in step 1, the resulting f molecule has some available I0 Recently, Mihalyi <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(26)</ref> has reported studies of pH changes in clotting which ma.y shed more light on the nature of the functional groups involved. 11 .4s used here, the term site refers to a point where another molecule can be attached. Each site is no doubt composed of a number of hydrogen-bond donors or acceptors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DONNELLY,</head><p>LASKOWSKI, NOTLEY AND SCHERAGA donors DiH and DZH for polymerization via steps 2 and 3. f is represented here, for simplicity, as a tetrafunctional monomer.12 According to our mechanism, not only can f polymerize to form fibrin, but there is also the possibility that a fibrin copolymer can be formed which consists of f and F (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). F molecules, in this scheme, would serve to terminate reaction chains. If, however, thrombin were present, these "dead" ends could be reactivated by step 1. This reactivation would contribute to the observed increase in opacity and rigidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(28)</ref> beyond the gel point, although, clearly, the effects observed beyond the gel point are not due primarily to such reactivation. If no thrombin were present (e.g., in synthetic F + f mixtures), then these 'Ldead" ends could not be reactivated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bifunctional Polymerization of Step 2</head><p>Consider as a possible idealization the schematic representation of f according to <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>. The site represented by DIH is assumed to contain many (say about 25) hydrogen-bond donors on the basis of preliminary calorimetric data,8 whereas the site represented by D2H is assumed to contain few (say 2 or 3) donors. The early stages of polymerization (step 2) would then be a bifunctional one l4 between A1 and DIH. The D2H donors and Az acceptors would not play a role here because there are too few groups available on these sites, thus rendering these sites less reactive for bonding the f molecules together. Also, AZ may not be ionized in the pH region (below 6.3 in 1 M NaBr) where only step 2 takes place, thus preventing cross-linking. Step 2 would then involve the formation of polymers fz , f3 , . . . f, by a bijunctional polymerization14 as shown for <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">12</ref> The donor groups are located near each other in this schematic representation since it appears that the proteolytic action of thrombin is localized in one portion of the fibrinogen molecule <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(27)</ref>. Most of the donors, DrH, are located at the "end" of the molecule'* to provide for the bifunctional polymerization, which seems characteristic of step 2. The extra set of donors and acceptors, DZH and AZ , provide for the cross-linking involved in step 3. It should also be pointed out that the release of only one peptide P in step 1 could be envisaged as uncovering turo donor sites.</p><p>18 In using the term "end," or in using schematic representations such as those of <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, we do not imply that the fibrinogen molecule necessarily has a highly asymmetric shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(17)</ref>. We are merely referring to the obvious fact that the sites are located in separate portions of the molecule which itself could even be (but probably is not) spherical and still be capable of polymerization.</p><p>14 Hydrodynamic <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">20)</ref> and electron microscope <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(29)</ref> evidence indicates that the polymerization before the gel point leads to the formation of very long intermediate polymers of various lengths. a dimer in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, all n-mers being in reversible equilibrium with each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5)</ref>. To rharacterize the system at a given concentration, we need to specify n -1 equilibria. Since the particular equilibria chosen are arbitrary, we choose the following set for convenience. All of these equilibria are to be regarded as analogs where the parentheses indicate molar concentrations (assuming activity coefficients to be unity). From the pH dependence of clotting <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(25)</ref> and of the distribution of intermediate polymers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5)</ref>, it is suggested that this polymerization occurs by hydrogen-bond formation between tyrosyl and/or lysyl and/or glycyl donors and histidyl acceptors. This proposed mechanism for step 2 implies, as already indicated, that the role of thrombin is to liberate P, thereby making t'he donor sites available for polymerization.</p><p>The existence of many equilibria is in agreement wit'h the existence of many species f, (even a few very long ones) deduced from electron microscope observations14 on dried preparat'ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(29)</ref>. If we adopt 500 A. as a monomer length <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(29)</ref>, then, e. g., for n = 20, the length would be 1 I.C. It can be seen from <ref type="figure">Figs. 3 and 4</ref> of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(29)</ref> that a wide range of particle sizes exists with several particles as large as 1~. Further, the eleetron microscope observations suggest that the cross section of an n-mer is, within experimental error, approximately that of the monomer. This suggests t,hat the polymerization of step 2 is bifunctional13 without any 382 DONNELLY, LASKOWSKI, NOTLEY AND SCHERAGA significant amount of lateral growth (possibly at most a staggered overlapping), as postulated in the above mechanism.</p><p>The existence of many species f, in equilibrium with each other might seem to be at variance with the two-peak ultracentrifugal patterns of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. In fact, such ultracentrifugal patterns have been cited (9) as evidence for two narrow ranges of species (monomer and intermediate polymer) with approximately equal distribution of the protein between the two peaks. It can be shown that the various species involved in the postulated equilibria would have a large concentration dependence of the sedimentation constant with an associated large Johnston-Ogston effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">31)</ref> rendering ultracentrifuge area measurements meaningless without additional information <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(31)</ref>. Also, it can be shown that, as a result of the large concentration dependence of s, all n-mers with n greater than 4 or 5 will have nearly equal sedimentation constants at a particular concentration. It is felt that these effects, together with the short halflife for the reversible equilibria of step 2,s give rise to the ultracentrifugal patterns of <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The actual form of the distribution function for the species f, depends on how K, depends on n.</p><p>It can be shown that if all K,'s are equal, then the dependence of (Op), on concentration is where K is the equilibrium constant, the same for all analogs of step 2 in Eq. (4), Ml is the molecular weight of the fl monomer (330,000), and c is the weight concentration. The data of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table II</ref> are plotted in this manner in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 5</ref>, where, even allowing for large experimental errors in (DP),~, it can be seen that Eq. (6) does not hold. Similar observations were reported by Ferry and co-workers (9) on thrombin-fibrinogen systems.</p><p>Since the assumption of the existence of the equilibria of Eq. (4) seems reasonable,14 we conclude that the assumption of equal K,'s is not a valid one. If the K,'s are unequal, they are still experimentally determinable, in principle, from a knowledge of the variation of (m), with c.

Treatment of the data by this method gave values of the K,'s which increased only slightly from K:! to KT and then began to increase rapidly at Kg , the computations being carried to Kg . Unfortunately, the small variation of (P), with c, at low c, introduces large errors in the determination of the Kn's, these errors being cumulative as n increases. Thus, while this method of analysis indicates that the K,,'s are unequal and gives values of x1 vs. c, it is not possible to obtain precise values of the K, 's. We are presently investigating, from a theoretical point of view, the possibility that K, may increase with n due to entropy effects associated with the large size of the n-mer, but at the same time decrease as n increases due to large charge repulsions. A combination of both effects may account for the sigmoidal character of the curve of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 5</ref>. Further light could probably be shed on the nature of the K,'s by also studying the COpolymerization of F and f in the absence of thrombin. Further, it is felt that the anomalous light-scattering curves <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3</ref>) arise from polydispersity.14 It has been possible t,o obtain t,heoretical scattering curves of the form shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> by postulating the existence of a mixture of fn's with an arbitrary number of discrete values of n. However, in the real case, all values for n must be admissible, so that the form of the arbitrary distribution function chosen for this computation is obviously not a unique one. Also, while one could match the initial portion of the scattering curve of <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> with a t,heoret,ical curve for monodispersed rods of a suitable value of n, such a value of n would have no significance as far as the distribution function is concerned.</p><p>The assumption of a fairly high degree of polydispersity is also compatible with the flow birefringence observations (see Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(8)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(20)</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 2 of this paper)</ref>. These curves for extinction angle x vs. G, are quaZitutiveLy similar t,o those computed for Gaussian distribubions of different degrees of heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(33)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Polymerization of</head><p>Step S From the t,emperature coefficient of the solubility of fibrin (1) and from preliminary calorimetric measurements,* it is known that heat is evolved in steps 2 and 3, in agreement with the hypothesis of hydrogen-bond formation. We may speculate on the reason for the distinction between steps 2 and 3. As already pointed out, DIH and A1 (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>) are more reactive sites than D2H and AZ because the former sites contain more donor and acceptor groups. Thus, in the early stages of polymerization (and in polymerization in 1 M NaBr below pH 6.3) step 2 is favored. When f, becomes sufficiently long, then enough side groups have accumulated to increase the probability that f, will branch. Such branching will lead to the cross-linking required in gel format.ion. In 1 M NaBr below (but close t'o) pH 6.3, the hydrogen-bond breaking ability of the solvent may be just sufficient to prevent cross-linking between t(he DZH and A? sites if only a fraction of t,he acceptors on A? are ionized near pH 6.3. Above pH 6.3 all the acaceptors on the A2 site are assumed to be ionized and the 1 M NaBr then (-annot' prevent crosslinking hydrogen bonds if f, is long enough. If there is no KaBr present (e.g., in 0.3 M NaCl), then the hydrogen bonding between DJ-I and AZ (which contain few donor and accept'or groups) is not int-erfered with 3) appears to be suitable for equilibrium and kinetic st.udies of the polymerization process.</p><p>On t.he basis of these results a possible mechanism of the clotting process has been proposed in terms of hydrogen bonding. The acceptor s&amp;es are assumed to exist on the original fibrinogen molecule, but the donor sites appear only after fibrinopeptide is liberated in step 1. The subsequent polymerization of step 2, while involving numerous equilibria, does not fit a scheme of equal equilibrium constants, but rather one in which the equilibrium constant depends on the size of the int,crmediate polymer. A possible explanation for the subsequent cross-linking of step 3 has been presented.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the species f, as indicated by sedimentation (see Fig. 1B) and flow birefringence (see Fig. 2).

SUMMARY IJltracentrifuge, flow birefringence, and light-scattering experiments have been carried out on various mixtures of fibrinogen and t.hrombin, and also of dissolved fibrin, a.t several pH's in 1 M NaBr. These experiment,s demonstrate the reversibility of the polymerization steps (subsequent. to the thrombin-induced proteolytic action on fibrinogen) in fibrin formation. If fibrin is dissolved in 1 111 NaBr at pH 5.3 the monomeric form of activated fibrinogen f is obtained. If it is dissolved in 1 M NaBr at pH 5.8-6.1 a mixture of the monomer and a series of intermediate polymers f, is formed. The conversion of f to f, and vice versa is easily accomplished by control of pH from 5.3 t.o 6.1 and back. The monomeric form (solubilized fibrin at pH 5.</figDesc></figure>

The Intuit Electronic Postmark documents the filing date of your income tax return, and the electronic postmark information should be kept on file with your tax return and other tax-related documentation.</p><p>There are two important aspects of the Intuit Electronic Postmark:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">THE INTUIT ELECTRONIC POSTMARK.</head><p>The electronic postmark shows the date and time Intuit received the federal return, and is deemed the filing date if the date of the electronic postmark is on or before the date prescribed for filing of the federal individual income tax return.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TIMELY FILING:</head><p>For your federal return to be considered filed on time, your return must be postmarked on or before midnight July 15, 2020. Intuit's electronic postmark is issued in the Pacific Time (PT) zone. If you are not filing in the PT zone, you will need to add or subtract hours from the Intuit Electronic Postmark time to determine your local postmark time. For example, if you are filing in the Eastern Time (ET) zone and you electronically file your return at 9 AM on July 15, 2020, your Intuit electronic postmark will indicate July 15, 2020, 6 AM. If your federal tax return is rejected, the IRS still considers it filed on time if the electronic postmark is on or before July 15, 2020, and a corrected return is submitted and accepted before July 20, 2020. If your return is submitted after July 20, 2020, a new time stamp is issued to reflect that your return was submitted after the IRS deadline and, consequently, is no longer considered to have been filed on time.</p><p>If you request an automatic six-month extension, your return must be electronically postmarked by midnight October 15, 2020. If your federal tax return is rejected, the IRS will still consider it filed on time if the electronic postmark is on or before October 15, 2020, and the corrected return is submitted and accepted by October 20, 2020.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE ACCEPTANCE DATE.</head><p>Once the IRS accepts the electronically filed return, the acceptance date will be provided by the Intuit Electronic Filing Center. This date is proof that the IRS accepted the electronically filed return.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES</head><p>If you are owed a federal tax refund, you have a right to choose how you will receive the refund. There are several options available to you. Please read about these options below.</p><p>You can file your federal tax return electronically or by paper and obtain your federal tax refund directly from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for free. If you file your tax return electronically, you can receive a refund check directly from the IRS through the U.S. Postal Service in 21 to 28 days from the time you file your tax return or the IRS can deposit your refund directly into your bank account in less than 21 days from the time you file your tax return unless there are delays by the IRS. If you file a paper return through the U.S. Postal Service, you can receive a refund check directly from the IRS through the U.S. Postal Service in 6 to 8 weeks from the time the IRS receives your return or the IRS can deposit your refund directly into your bank account in 6 to 8 weeks from the time the IRS receives your return. However, if your return contains Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS will issue your refund no earlier than February 15, 2020.</p><p>The RPS is not necessary to obtain your refund. If you have an existing bank account, you do not need to use the RPS in order to receive a direct deposit from the IRS. You may consult the IRS website (IRS.gov) for information about tax refund processing.</p><p>If you select the RPS, no prior debt you may owe to Bank will be deducted from your refund.</p><p>You can change your income tax withholdings which might result in you receiving additional funds throughout the year rather than waiting to receive these funds potentially in an income tax refund next year. Please consult your employer or tax advisor for additional details.</p><p>This Agreement requires all disputes to be resolved by way of binding arbitration. The terms of the arbitration provision appear in section 10.</p><p>Information regarding low-cost deposit accounts may be available at www.mymoney.gov .</p><p>The chart below shows the options for filing your tax return (e-file or paper return), the RPS product, refund disbursement options, estimated timing for obtaining your tax refund proceeds, and costs associated with the various options.</p><p>You can file your tax return electronically, select the Refund Processing Service ("RPS"), and have your federal income tax refund processed through a processor using banking services of a financial institution. The RPS allows your refund to be deposited into a bank account intended for one-time use at Green Dot Bank ("Bank") and deducts your TurboTax fees and other fees you authorize from your refund. The balance is delivered to you via the disbursement method you select. If you file your tax return electronically and select the RPS, the IRS will deposit your refund with Bank. Upon Bank's receipt of your refund, Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, LLC, a processor, will deduct and pay from your refund any fees charged by TurboTax for the preparation and filing of your tax return and any other amounts authorized by you and disburse the balance of your refund proceeds to you. Unless there are delays by the IRS, refunds are received in less than 21 days from the time you file your tax return electronically. However, if your return contains Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS will issue your refund no earlier than February 15, 2020.  Qualifying widow(er).</p></div>

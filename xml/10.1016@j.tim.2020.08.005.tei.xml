			<abstract>
				<p>Coral reefs are in crisis, with massive global loss predicted by the end of this century. Any solutions developed to help mitigate coral reef decline will benefit from an improved understanding of the interpartner communication underlying the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, and we can draw upon our more advanced knowledge of interkingdom communication in other host-microbe interactions. Recent studies, including the application of multi-omics approaches, have identified signaling molecules possibly involved in regulating this symbiosis, including glycans, signaling lipids, reactive species, volatiles, and noncoding RNAs. Advancements in tool development for coral conservation, such as the application of CRISPR/Cas9, rely on identifying target genes to enhance symbiosis stability. Such manipulation of interpartner signaling in symbiotic systems has already been applied to enhance agricultural practices.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis is of huge importance as it underpins the success of coral reefs, yet we know very little about how the host cnidarian and its dinoflagellate endosymbionts communicate with each other to form a functionally integrated unit. Here, we review the current knowledge of interpartner molecular signaling in this symbiosis, with an emphasis on lipids, glycans, reactive species, biogenic volatiles, and noncoding RNA. We draw upon evidence of these compounds from recent omics-based studies of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis and discuss the signaling roles that they play in other, better-studied symbioses. We then consider how improved knowledge of interpartner signaling might be used to develop solutions to the coral reef crisis by, for example, engineering more thermally resistant corals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coral Reef Ecosystems in Crisis from Climate Change</head><p>Many cnidarians (see Glossary) are dependent on the metabolic benefits provided by symbiotic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, which live inside their host's gastrodermal cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This symbiosis is of immense global value as it forms the basis of the coral reef ecosystem. These reefs may not survive this century as a result of accelerating stressors that cause 'bleaching', where the symbiosis becomes dysfunctional and the dinoflagellate symbionts are lost from their host corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Our capacity to respond to this ecosystem-level crisis is hindered by significant gaps in our knowledge of how the symbiosis operates, and in particular the molecular language that allows the host and symbiont to form a functionally integrated unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This is especially important when considering the potential for corals to adapt to climate change by establishing novel symbioses with more thermally resistant species of Symbiodiniaceae <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, as well as the development of technologies for engineering stress-resistant corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>Molecular signaling is essential to both symbiosis establishment and dynamic homeostasis in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate partnership. There is evidence for the control of nutritional exchange, coordination of host and symbiont cell growth, evasion of the host's immune system by the intracellular algae, and upregulation of protein phosphorylation in symbiotic versus aposymbiotic hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, the field lags far behind those focused on other ecologically important symbioses, such as the mycorrhiza-plant, rhizobia-leguminous plant, insect-bacteria, and mammalmicrobiota mutualisms. Likewise, there is a deep understanding of the role of molecular signaling in some medically important human-parasite interactions, such as those involving apicomplexans, which have close phylogenetic placement to dinoflagellates. Here, we review our current understanding of interpartner signaling in the establishment and maintenance of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses, identify key knowledge gaps, and highlight how we might apply a better understanding of interpartner communication to developing solutions to coral reef decline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecular Signaling in the Cnidarian-Dinoflagellate Symbiosis</head><p>Molecular signaling is ubiquitous across biological systems (Box 1). An array of compounds, including lipids, glycans, proteins, small peptides, nucleotides, and dissolved gases, act as both extracellular ligands and intracellular messengers. Not all of these molecules have been identified as candidate interpartner signals in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, but evidence points to glycans, reactive species, noncoding RNAs, and lipids as playing a critical role in symbiosis establishment and maintenance <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, Key <ref type="figure">Figure)</ref>.</p><p>In the established symbiosis, all communication must occur across the symbiosome membrane, which functions as the signaling interface and is known to contain specific transporters as well as GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the symbiotic state affects cell signaling in the cnidarian host <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Notably, the central transcription factor regulating innate immunity, NF-κB, is downregulated in the stable symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, indicating that continuous tolerogenic molecular dialogue results in a healthy symbiosis. We still have just partial information on what interpartner signaling molecules are involved in symbiosis establishment and homeostasis, though we know something about those involved in temperature-induced bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Here, we focus on potential interpartner signaling compound classes, for which we have good evidence in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, to consider their possible modes of action within the context of other well-studied symbiotic systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glossary</head><p>Aiptasia: a symbiotic sea anemone that has been adopted as a model organism in cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis research because of the ease of its cultivation and manipulation. The species commonly employed is Exaiptasia pallida (recently renamed as Exaiptasia diaphana). Apicomplexa: a eukaryotic clade that, together with dinoflagellates and ciliates, belongs to the Alveolata group. Apicomplexans are endoparasites with complex life cycles characterized by a specialized apical organelle, the apicoplast, used to penetrate the host cell. Apicomplexans are diverse and include the agents of malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii). Aposymbiotic: the state in which the host is devoid of symbionts. In Aiptasia this state can be induced experimentally by exposure to menthol, darkness, or thermal stress, and is often used in comparative studies to understand symbiotic processes. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi: fungi which form mutualistic symbiotic associations with &gt;80% of land plants by colonizing roots within specialized vesicles, the arbuscules. They have wide host ranges, provide the host with phosphorus in exchange for organic carbon and lipids, and greatly increase plant stress resilience. Cnidaria: an animal phylum consisting predominantly of marine animals, including corals, sea anemones, hydrozoans, and jellyfish, all of which have radially symmetrical body forms and specialized stinging cells called nematocysts. Some cnidarians, notably reef-building corals, form obligate symbioses with symbiotic dinoflagellates. GPCRs: G-protein-coupled receptors are a highly diverse group of cellsurface receptors characterized by seven transmembrane domains. GPCRs interact with many different types of signaling molecule and trigger the activation of heterotrimeric guanosine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) to relay a signaling event. Holobiont: the full assemblage of organisms that comprise a symbiotic unit. In corals, the holobiont consists of the host cnidarian, endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, bacteria, archaea, viruses, and other microbes.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glycan-Mediated Signaling</head><p>Glycans are surface-associated and secreted carbohydrates that play a wide variety of roles across biological systems. These include physical roles, such as providing structural strength and rigidity (e.g., cellulose in plant cell walls), and the hindrance or expulsion of invading microbes (e.g., mucins on epithelial surfaces). Glycans also modulate the functions of proteins and lipids to which they attach. Some of these roles, such as glycoprotein folding and the organization of cell membranes, are more general, but others are especially relevant to symbiosis. In particular, glycan-lectin binding triggers phagocytosis/endocytosis, facilitates intercellular signaling, and influences immune modulation by host organisms, with glycans potentially produced by either host or symbiont <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The best studied symbioses in this regard are the rhizobia-leguminous plant and arbuscular mycorrhizae-plant associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In both cases, microbial lipochitooligosaccharides act as diffusible signals and interact with receptors on hosts to activate the 'common symbiotic pathway' and root nodulation or mycorrhization.</p><p>A large body of evidence supports the hypothesis that glycan-lectin interactions function in establishment of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Studies have identified glycans on symbiont cell surfaces and released into the host tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>), and an abundance of lectins in host genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. Recent work using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has shown that the symbiont glycome is diverse and complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Modification of surface glycans with digestive enzymes, or masking via treatment with exogenous lectins, results in decreased rates of symbiont uptake by hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Furthermore, modification of glycome structure using glycan biosynthesis inhibitors decreases colonization success <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Whether glycan-lectin interactions play a role in host-symbiont specificity is still an open question. Interference with surface glycans does not impact colonization rates of corals by all Symbiodiniaceae species equally <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, while similar experiments with the hydra-Chlorella symbiosis have shown no evidence that glycan-lectin signaling plays a significant part in host-symbiont discrimination in this symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. These latter observations led Parkinson and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> to test whether differential symbiont surface glycan profiles could explain different colonization rates in the Aiptasia model system. They identified subtle differences in high-mannoside and  Trends in Microbiology hybrid-type protein-linked glycans between a successful versus unsuccessful colonizer, yet masking of these glycans had no effect on colonization success. Comparing LC-MS/MS profiles across the diversity of Symbiodiniaceae, and mapping these profiles onto observed colonization success, would provide high-resolution information on symbiosis specificity and help to resolve the role of glycan-lectin interactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lipid-Mediated Signaling</head><p>Oxylipins Oxylipins constitute an expansive group of signaling lipids created by the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Following their hydrolysis from membrane lipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2), free PUFAs are oxidized stereospecifically by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), or cytochrome P450 (CYP) family enzymes. Oxylipins are membrane-diffusible, short-lived signaling molecules with major roles in regulating inflammation and cellular homeostasis in metazoans through their interaction with specific GPCRs and peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptors (PPARs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In plants, the best studied oxylipins are the jasmonates (Box 2), which function in development, stress, and defense responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Oxylipin signaling regulates developmental processes in fungi and protozoans, and also functions in quorum sensing in fungi and bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>The ubiquitous language of oxylipins mediates cross-kingdom communication in various hostmicrobe interactions and has been particularly well studied in those involving fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Pathogenic fungi hijack the oxylipin signaling system of plants and mammals to attenuate a host immune response and facilitate infection. Fungal oxylipins can activate host GPCRs to modify the transcription of enzymes involved in host oxylipin metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. In turn, plant oxylipins modulate fungal development by activating fungal GPCRs in a compound-specific manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Plant oxylipin synthesis also plays a regulatory role in the interactions with beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>; however, the mechanisms involved are still under debate. The suppression of host oxylipin synthesis may also assist in the establishment of the rhizobia-leguminous plant symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>Corals encode LOX, as well as allene oxide-lipoxygenase fusion proteins (AOS-LOXin which AOS is a CYP family enzyme that is missing in higher metazoans <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>), whereas COX is restricted to certain species <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Characterization of oxylipin synthesis in scleractinian corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> revealed the predominant biosynthesis of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). Coral oxylipins are synthesized in response to wounding, heat stress, and pathogen infection, suggesting a role in immunity and responses to stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Significantly, a transcriptomic analysis of Aiptasia showed that PLA2, LOX, and AOS-LOX genes are downregulated in the symbiotic state <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, suggesting a tolerogenic response to symbiosis. A decrease in PLA2 and LOX gene expression in symbiotic versus aposymbiotic anemones has recently been observed, but only when Aiptasia was colonized by homologous (i.e., native) rather than heterologous (i.e., non-native) Symbiodiniaceae <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. These findings suggest that host oxylipin signaling is suppressed in an optimal symbiosis, dampening the host immune response and so facilitating symbiont persistence. As observed in other biological systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> in these dinoflagellates did detect methyl jasmonate (Box 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, a derivative of the oxylipin pathway that is common to fungi and plants, but not synthesized by higher metazoans <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. A 'multiomics' approach will help to elucidate the possible role of oxylipin-based signaling in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sphingolipids</head><p>Sphingolipids are essential constituents of biological membranes that are ubiquitous across eukaryotes. The sphingolipid metabolic pathway involves the biosynthesis of several lipids that function in cell signaling via the activation of specific GPCRs to regulate diverse physiological processes, including apoptosis, cell survival, inflammation, and autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. The balance in cellular concentrations of pro-survival (sphingosine-1-phosphate: S1P) and proapoptotic (sphingosine and ceramide) sphingolipids is a vital homeostatic process. This 'sphingolipid rheostat' determines cell fate by the interconversion of these metabolites and is coordinated by metabolic flux and the relative activities of key enzymes, including sphingosine kinase (SPHK) and S1P phosphatase (SGPP).</p><p>Several microbes modulate host sphingolipid signaling to regulate host immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. The bacterial pathogen of humans, Legionella pneumophila, secretes S1P lyase into host cells to decrease host S1P synthesis, thereby decreasing autophagy and promoting infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Similarly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis prevents host S1P synthesis by inhibiting host SPHK to attenuate phagosome maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. In plants, shifting the sphingolipid rheostat constitutes a stress response that triggers programmed cell death upon pathogen detection, and certain pathogens modify host sphingolipid metabolism to either prevent or stimulate host cell death, depending on their life style <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Some nonobligate pathogenic fungi stimulate host cell death by synthesizing toxins that mimic plant host sphingosines and competitively inhibit ceramide synthases <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Box 2. Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds</head><p>Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are small carbon-chain-or carbon-ring-containing compounds with high vapor pressure at ambient temperature. They easily dissolve in water or disperse at interfaces to exert complex 'infochemical' signatures. In terrestrial systems, BVOCs play numerous physiological and ecological roles, from protection against abiotic stress and pathogens to chemical signaling influencing ecological interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. Their role in marine systems, however, and as a collective of compounds (the volatilome, <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>), remains a 'black-box'. A wide range of BVOCs (e.g., isoprene, alkanes, alkenes, ketones, aldehydes, sulfur compounds) have been detected in dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref> and corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103]</ref>, yet their roles are still unknown. BVOCs may be critical constituents of the 'reactive species interactome', in particular over evolutionary-ecological scales.</p><p>The sulfur gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) is the only well-studied BVOC in marine systems. DMS is produced via the cleavage of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) by lyase enzymes present in the dinoflagellate symbiont (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> in main text) <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref> and host-associated bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref>. However, all partners of the holobiont, including the cnidarian host, are sources of DMSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. DMS and DMSP are involved in algal-bacterial interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref>, and in structuring the coral microbiome <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. Microbes themselves produce antimicrobial compounds such as tropodithietic acid, derived from DMSP catabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>. DMSP biosynthesis is upregulated when corals experience physiological stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">109]</ref>, suggesting that it acts as an antioxidant for corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. Certain pathogens, in turn, sense DMSP from coral mucus as a chemotactic cue to target heat-stressed corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. However, DMS appears to also act as a signaling molecule for many reef organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref> and it may regulate climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>, or play broader-scale roles in ensuring the stability of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis.</p><p>Members of the family Symbiodiniaceae also produce halogenated hydrocarbons such as benzaldehyde and methyl jasmonate (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> in main text) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, which are respectively involved in signaling in insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[111]</ref> and plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> (see main text). The potential for BVOCs to play a role in interpartner signaling in symbiosis is highlighted by ectomycorrhizal fungi, which produce sesquiterpenes that stimulate lateral root production by the plant, the site of fungal colonization, prior to contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. Both corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[103]</ref> and symbiotic dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref> appear to emit isoprene, which supports resistance to thermal stress in plants and acts in antiherbivory defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>. Uncovering the potentially many faceted roles of BVOCs in reef systemsand in sustaining the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosisremains a vastly understudied topic.</p><p>Similarly, the ability to suppress plant sphingolipid synthesis underpins the strain-specific virulence of certain pathogenic bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Transcriptome analysis of the temperate anemone Anthopleura elegantissima revealed that SGPP is downregulated in symbiotic compared with aposymbiotic anemones, suggesting a role for the host sphingolipid rheostat in regulating the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Furthermore, in Aiptasia, the presence of symbionts, both in early and established phases of symbiosis, modifies host sphingolipid signaling, shifting colonized host cells towards a pro-survival state by decreasing SGPP transcription ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The maintenance of this shift in the host sphingolipid rheostat towards anti-apoptosis/pro-survival signaling is thought to regulate symbiosis stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Disruption in the rheostat balance is, in turn, involved in heat stress-induced symbiosis breakdown <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, and experimental supplementation with exogenous S1P rescued anemones from bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The symbiont-derived signaling that initiates the change in host SGPP gene expression is not known; ongoing research is required to characterize the pathways and receptors involved.</p></div>

Interestingly, in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, functional genomic evidence suggests that hosts rely on their algal symbionts to supply sterols, rather than synthesizing them on their own <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, while other microbes commonly scavenge cholesterol from the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p><p>The sterol transporter Niemann-Pick type C2-like protein (NPC2) was notably upregulated in symbiotic versus aposymbiotic cnidarians in several transcriptomic and proteomic analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. In mammals, NPC2 exports sterols from the lumen of late endosomes and lysosomes. The cnidarian-specific homologue, NPC2-d, has been localized to the symbiosome compartment and is expressed exclusively in the presence of symbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Detailed analysis of host and symbiont sterol profiles, along with NPC2-d functional analysis, indicate that NPC2-d mediates the transfer of sterols from the symbiont to the host <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>), suggesting that sterol trafficking plays an important role in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Correspondingly, an analysis of diel lipid fluxes showed a significant accumulation of sterols in host gastrodermal cells and a concurrent rise in sterol esters in symbionts at night <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. However, increased NPC2-d protein expression was only observed for Aiptasia harboring homologous rather than heterologous symbionts, implying that sterol trafficking might be a hallmark of an optimal hostsymbiont pairing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The role of sterol trafficking in interpartner communication in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis remains unclear, and it is unknown whether sterols are further metabolized into oxysterols and steroid hormones, and what signaling roles these might have. Additionally, the influence of sterol trafficking on the formation of lipid rafts remains unexplored. Many pathogenic bacteria and protozoans use host lipid rafts as entry portals, and manipulate their formation to promote infection and intracellular survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, ultimately residing in lipid raft-enriched vacuoles. The lipid raftresident protein, flotillin, is upregulated in symbiotic Aiptasia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, suggesting that lipid rafts are increased in the symbiotic state. The properties of the symbiosome membrane in the cnidariandinoflagellate symbiosis remain largely unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, but future research should investigate whether lipid rafts are important for interpartner signaling across this interface.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>] are produced by mitochondria and plastids to control nearly every aspect of an organism's biology, from metabolism to the regulation of gene expression. They, in turn, may underpin regulation of symbiosis homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Nitric oxide (NO) is another free radical that is produced endogenously and recognized as a signaling molecule across all life. NO is a master regulator for many physiological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Chemical interactions of NO with ROS generate reactive nitrogen species (RNS), including the highly reactive and potentially damaging peroxynitrite (ONOO -), thereby forming additional oxidative signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Reactive sulfur species (RSS), such as polysulfides and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), have only recently become recognized as intracellular messengers that respond to abiotic perturbations <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>. ROS-RNS-RSS (referred to here as 'reactive species'), individually or in combination, regulate common and/or complementary pathways associated with cellular homeostasis. This repertoire of signals may be better considered as the 'reactive species interactome' <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, whereby the synthesis of one or more reactive species upon perception of a stimulus may provide a networked response that primes the tolerance to subsequent stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Capacity to regulate reactive species concentrations within cellular compartmentsand thereby the means to act as an effective signal for cellular homeostasisis linked to compartment-specific sensing systems organized to propagate the signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. While reactive species may be produced continuously, stressors induce reactive species build-up that can overwhelm antioxidant capacity, leading to cellular damage unless metabolism can be adjusted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reactive Species-Mediated Signaling</head><p>Studies have consistently demonstrated that the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis accumulates ROS <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref> and/or RNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref> in parallel with metabolic dysfunction under stressors such as high temperature and light. Such metabolic dysfunction is typically accompanied by conspicuous bleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>, suggesting that reactive species could operate as a signal of symbiosis instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> if intercepted by the host to initiate symbiont expulsion <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. While both hosts and symbionts can be prolific producers of volatile sulfur compounds (Box 2), the role of RSS in either cellular or interpartner homeostasis is entirely unexplored. Removal of an underperforming or stressed symbiont species in favor of another, more metabolically compatible partner under suboptimal environmental conditions is a means by which reactive species signaling could support persistence of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis over ecological-evolutionary scales. Aside from the potential for reactive species to regulate genes fundamental to symbiosis stability at the host-symbiont interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, the actual capacity for reactive species to pass from symbiont to host, and thus operate as a signal for symbiont population regulation, is largely unknown, with the exception of H O 2 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>). H 2 O 2 triggers mitogen-activated protein kinases, which, in animals, mediate a signaling cascade that can result in exocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>. Within dinoflagellate symbionts, H O 2 accumulation occurs where the antioxidant network capacity is exceeded <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. While such tantalizing evidence suggests that H O 2 operates as a key signal driving symbiont expulsion, it remains to be validated. Evidence of a role for reactive species in (re-)establishment of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis is similarly patchy. Exposure of bacteria to reactive species is well recognized as a trigger for establishing symbiosis with many organisms, notably plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, and squid <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. Sustaining a high ROS environment to maintain an oxidative 'atmosphere' that prevents defense genes from being signaled appears to be important for enabling symbiosis establishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. ROS and NO appear critical to the cnidarian immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>, and bacteria capable of neutralizing ROS (e.g., Vibrio spp.) are successful pathogenic invaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Resolving how the nature of ROS production translates to recognition of a desired symbiont by the host versus the capacity for the symbiont to escape the host immune response to pathogenesis is critical.</p><p>Noncoding RNA-Mediated Signaling</p><p>Noncoding RNAs are regulatory molecules that can silence gene expression by binding target mRNAs. Translocation of noncoding RNAs can induce RNA interference between evolutionarily distant organisms. This mechanism of interkingdom communication has been characterized in a variety of host-microbe interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Pathogenic fungi excrete noncoding RNAs to silence host immune defense genes, thereby promoting infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>. Rhizobia-derived noncoding RNAs function as signaling molecules to regulate host legume genes associated with nodulation. Studies of maize colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi suggest that fungal noncoding RNAs regulate nutrient exchange in this symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. There is evidence that noncoding RNAs are involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation in both partners of the cnidariandinoflagellate symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Cnidarian host noncoding RNAs are differentially expressed in response to colonization by symbionts, and are complementary to host genes implicated in symbiosis regulation, including proteins involved in immune responses and symbiosome maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>. The reciprocal translocation of noncoding RNAs as a signaling mechanism in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis has not yet been confirmed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref>), but shared mRNA targets have been identified in both partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tool Development</head><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that we have only 10 years to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 o C above preindustrial levels to reduce catastrophic coral reef ecosystem loss. Research is rapidly exploring active management interventions to enhance reef resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref>. Potential solutions include switching symbionts for more thermally resistant species <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86]</ref>, selective coral breeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, and coral probiotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. Whether and how such interventions are ultimately deployed is an active area of debate, requiring careful consideration of the ecological, ethical, and societal impacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. These considerations extend well beyond this review, but it is nevertheless clear that developing emerging technologieswhich can take years to decadesis essential to maximize our options in the uncertain future. To add to this effort, there is an urgent need to develop approaches that directly alter symbiosis function, and in particular, manipulate communication pathways that regulate symbiosis stability under both nonstressful and stressful conditions. For example, our ability to engineer new, thermally resistant pairings is limited by host-symbiont specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>, with a range of studies revealing that novel symbionts can cause changes in interpartner signaling, cellular stress, and immune function, with reduced rates of host growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>.</p><p>Improved understanding of interpartner communication will be advanced with tool development, including the application of gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>. This technology has been used to generate loss-of-function mutations in sea anemones <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>, and recently in larval corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>, but is not yet available for dinoflagellate symbionts, despite considerable effort, due to several hurdles, including a thick cell wall (making introduction of material via transfection difficult), unusual chromosomal structure, and large evolutionary divergence from other tractable algal systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. Signs of methodological breakthroughs for the host, such as recent advances in single-cell isolation and gene expression analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, are promising and stress the urgency to understand interpartner communication so that we can target genes and pathways that most enhance resilience. Such approaches are more advanced in agricultural research (Box 3).</p><p>In addition, a deeper understanding of interpartner signaling will allow us to develop diagnostic tools to more comprehensively monitor reef health <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. In particular, poor knowledge of interpartner communication hinders our ability to detect subtle signs of (or biological constituents that promote susceptibility to) symbiosis dysfunction that could be used to develop biomarkers for diagnosing sublethal stress. Metabolomic assessment of interpartner signaling pathways, which will likely require the use of multiple specialized omics techniques, for example, volatilomics (Box 2) and targeted lipidomic approaches, provides a potentially powerful way forward since the metabolome is a downstream emergent property of genotype, phenotype, and environmental drivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. This can underpin novel tools such as biochemical or bio-optical-based sensors (Box 3) that can enable high-throughput screening of stress susceptibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding Remarks</head><p>In summary, we highlight the importance of interpartner signaling in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis and describe current evidence for the involvement of glycans, oxylipins, sphingolipids, sterols, reactive species, noncoding RNAs, and biogenic volatile organic compounds. We still have much to learn about host-symbiont communication in this symbiosis, but in particular, we lack knowledge of exactly what signaling pathways operate in the symbiosis, as well as how and where signals are synthesized and perceived. Such core gaps in knowledge entirely limit our understanding of how this communication facilitates symbiosis onset and maintenance. While we focus here on those classes of compounds for which we have reasonable evidence, our coverage is certainly not comprehensive, with compounds such as insulin <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref> perhaps also playing a part. Furthermore, we concentrate on signaling molecules that may pass between the two partners, yet there is also emerging evidence for a role of secondary messengers (Box 1) in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, including those associated with the phosphatidylinositol pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref>; notably, certain bacterial pathogens and protozoan parasites manipulate Synthetic engineering of plant-microbe communication in agricultural practices aims to improve the productivity and sustainability of global food production <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>. Engineering of the rhizosphere community can enhance advantageous symbiotic traits conferred by the association of crops with mycorrhizal fungi, including enhanced growth, nutrient efficiency, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Due to the broad host range of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, this can be achieved through breeding and bioinoculation <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>. A more long-standing objective has been to extend the symbiosis with rhizobia to nonleguminous crops, such as cereals, to reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>. The successful engineering of a synthetic rhizobia-plant symbiosis depends on an understanding of the interpartner signaling involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>, which has been derived from comparative omics analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref> and aided by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>. Much of the required signaling machinery is already present in cereals because of the common symbiosis signaling (SYM) pathway derived from the more evolutionarily ancestral and widespread symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizae <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[120]</ref>. However, the SYM pathway must be activated by the perception of rhizobial Nod factors and yield a nodulation-specific output <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>. The transfer of host-specific Nod receptors between legume species proved successful in enabling novel rhizobia-host associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[121]</ref>. Initial success in the perception of Nod factors in rice has also been achieved through the expression of Nod receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[122]</ref>. A more comprehensive understanding of downstream signaling pathways is necessary, however, to achieve the establishment of a stable symbiosis.</p><p>Innovative tools like genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref> enable in silico metabolic modelling and predictions of metabolic flux balance under different environmental conditions, which can contribute to the identification of putative gene targets for manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>. Critical is the spatiotemporal mapping of symbiotic processes, which can be analyzed using multigene expression reporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref> and bioreporters for metabolite tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">126]</ref>. Current technology is not limited by the synthesis of multigene constructs or transformation protocols for large-scale genome manipulations in the generation of transgenic model plants, and the output of genetic engineering can be comprehensively tested by next-generation sequencing. Yet, a major challenge lies in identifying promoters for stable gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref> without inducing gene silencing. In addition, trade-offs of a synthetic symbiosis must be understood to ensure that immunity towards pathogens is not compromised <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>. The advancements towards effective symbiosis engineering in agriculture have depended on multidisciplinary, integrative, mission-driven research <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>, and while the road ahead is still long, the current state of the field provides an excellent case study for the future direction of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis research.</p><p>this pathway in the host to facilitate host cell invasion and their intracellular persistence <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97]</ref>. We highlight priorities for future research in 'Outstanding Questions' and urge a cooperative, coordinated effort by researchers in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis field, and those with expertise in cell signaling, to characterize molecular communication in this globally significant symbiosis. Understanding how molecular signaling coordinates symbiosis homeostasis and determines different host-symbiont pairings will likely be central to the effectiveness of novel tools and approaches to help coral reefs survive into the next century.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The Cnidarian-Dinoflagellate Symbiosis.

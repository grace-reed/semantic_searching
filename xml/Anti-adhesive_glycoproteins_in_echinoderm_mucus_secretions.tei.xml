			<abstract>
				<p>Marine invertebrates produce a large variety of mucus secretions which are rich in glycoproteins. As part of our studies of natural antifouling mechanisms, mucus secretions from the starfish Marthasterias glacialis and Porania pulvillus and the brittlestar Ophiocomina nigra have been used to characterise the structure and function of some of the glycoproteins present in these secretions. Mucus was collected from all three species and fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. A high molecular weight glycoprotein fraction was collected from each species. Monosaccharide analysis and FTIR demonstrated a composition consistent with a mucin-type glycoprotein. The mucin from M. glacialis and O. nigra inhibited in vitro bacterial adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the mucin from P. pulvillus promoted bacterial adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. All of the mucins inhibited the adhesion of human neutrophils to cultured human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) and had no anticoagulant activity. The mucins described here have adhesion-regulating functions that may have a role in the antifouling or feeding mechanisms of the organisms that produce them. These mucins may also be of therapeutic value through their ability to regulate human neutrophil adhesion or bacterial adhesion.</p>

Consequently, many organisms have developed antifouling mechanisms including surface cleaning, surface sloughing, secretion of toxins, and the maintenance of a nonstick surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abarzua and Jakubowski, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wahl, 1989)</ref>. Echinoderm mucus secretions are involved in important functions including feeding, attachment, defence, and cleaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Canicatti and D'Ancona, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chaet, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fontaine, 1964)</ref>. Filter-feeding species use mucus to capture and parcel food particles; this also acts as a cleaning mechanism which eliminates microscopic fouling organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chaet and Philpott, 1964)</ref>. Many species locally secrete adhesive mucus which is important for successful substrate attachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Thomas and Hermans, 1985)</ref>, whereas others may secrete antiadhesive mucus, which prevents colonisation by fouling organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(McKenzie and Grigovala, 1996)</ref>. Mucus secretions may also contain toxins and lytic compounds to deter fouling organisms or predators <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fontaine, 1964)</ref>.</p><p>Mucus secretions provide a protective barrier on all epithelial surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carlstedt and Davies, 1997)</ref>. They have varied composition but are commonly rich in glycoproteins, termed mucins, which are characterised by high levels of O-linked oligosaccharides <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Strous and Dekker, 1992)</ref>. Mucins are a heterogeneous class of compounds including both cell surface species <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shimizu and Shaw, 1993)</ref>, which have roles in cell-cell interaction, and secreted species, which have roles in the function of mucus as a physical and biological barrier (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Perez-Vilar and Hill, 1999)</ref>. The O-linked sugars are commonly composed of N-acetyl galactosamine, N-acetyl glucosamine, galactose, fucose, and sialic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Strous and Dekker, 1992)</ref> and are commonly sulphated. Secreted mucins are often very large (N10 6 Da), highly hydrated molecules that form viscous films on surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Perez-Vilar and Hill, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Strous and Dekker, 1992)</ref>. Cell surface mucins mediate a number of cellular interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fukuda, 2002)</ref> which have been implicated in disease processes, including cancer, inflammation and infection. There have been few studies of the glycoproteins present in marine invertebrate mucus secretions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fontaine, 1964)</ref>; however, it has been suggested that these contain proteoglycan <ref type="bibr">(PG;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McKenzie and Grigovala, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>The presence of acid mucopolysaccharides has been previously indicated in the mucus secretions of the brittlestar Ophiocomina nigra <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fontaine, 1964)</ref>, and the raw mucus from this species has been shown to have anticoagulant properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fontaine, 1964)</ref>.The structures of PGs extracted from sea cucumbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pavao et al., 1998)</ref> have previously been reported, and there has been a single study of mucus glycoproteins from the coral Acropora formosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Meikle et al., 1987)</ref>. This study aimed to establish the identity and antifouling properties of glycoproteins in echinoderm mucus secretions. Glycoproteins were purified from the mucus of the starfish Marthasterias glacialis and were compared to similar glycoproteins purified from the filter feeding starfish Porania pulvillus and the brittlestar O. nigra.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Materials</head><p>All chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK), unless otherwise stated. All plasticware was from Corning (High Wycombe, Bucks, UK), unless otherwise stated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Animals and collection of mucus</head><p>Divers collected specimens of the starfish, M. glacialis, from sea lochs on the West Coast of Scotland. Trawling was used to collect specimens of the brittlestar, O. nigra, and the cushion star, P. pulvillus. Specimens were transported in fresh seawater and transferred to aerated through-flow seawater aquaria. Starfish were kept at a density of 30 animals per 500-l tank. M. glacialis were fed mussels (Mytilus edulis) collected locally.</p><p>Mucus was collected from O. nigra and M. glacialis in response to physical stress. Specimens were placed in a large glass funnel and agitated with a glass rod. After a few minutes, large amounts of mucus were secreted in response to this stress. The mucus was collected in 50-ml centrifuge tubes.</p><p>Mucus was also collected from M. glacialis and P. pulvillus using suction. The mucus was aspirated from the dorsal surface of both species using a fine glass Pasteur pipette connected to a reservoir under suction. Animals were first blotted with paper towel to remove excess seawater. M. glacialis and O. nigra were kept for periods up to 12 months and appeared to be unharmed by weekly mucus collection. P. pulvillus developed surface lesions after several weeks of mucus collection, possibly due to cuticular damage associated with mucus collection. Mucus was stored at 4 8C for short periods prior to processing.</p><p>The uronic acid content of samples was determined after acid hydrolysis (6.0 M HCl at 100 8C for 6 h) by the modified carbazole reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bitter and Muir, 1962)</ref>, and the hexosamine content was determined by the Elson-Morgan reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rondle and Morgan, 1955)</ref>. Standard curves for hexosamine and hexuronic acid were constructed from glucosamine and glucuronic acid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Purification of glycoproteins from mucus</head><p>Mucus samples were clarified by centrifugation at 500Âg for 10 min. Five milliliters of supernatant was applied to a column of Sepharose CL-6B (100Â2.6 cm, Pharmacia Biotech), which had previously been equilibrated with 0.9% NaCl solution. The sample was eluted at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min À1 with 0.9% NCl. The absorbance (A ) of the eluant was monitored continuously, and fractions were collected every 3 min. The column was calibrated with a gel filtration high molecular weight calibration kit (Pharmacia Biotech) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>The protein content of fractions collected from columns was measured using CoomassieR Plus reagent (Pierce). Albumin standards were prepared in the range 0-5 Ag ml À1 .</p><p>The concentration of sulphated polysaccharides in fractions collected from columns was estimated using the dimethylmethylene blue assay, which has traditionally been used as an assay for glycosaminoglycans <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Farndale et al., 1986)</ref>, but which detects other sulphated polysaccharides. Heparin (Multiparink, CP pharmaceuticals), chondroitin sulphate C (Shark cartilage, Sigma), and bovine mucin (Type 1S, Sigma) all produced equivalent standard curves in the range 0 -10 Ag ml À1 , but chondroitin sulfate was used for quantification. The absorbance of standards and samples at 490 nm was measured in 96-well plates using a Biotek EL 340 plate reader.</p><p>Large amounts of glycan eluted in the void volume of the Sepharose CL-6B column. These fractions were pooled and dialysed (MW cut off 12,000; Philip Harris Scientific) against three changes of a hundred volumes of distilled water over 24 h, and freeze dried for long-term storage at À20 8C. Limited amounts of partially purified glycoprotein from M. glacialis were further purified using a DEAE Sepharose column.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">HPLC analysis of mucus</head><p>Crude mucus and partially purified glycoprotein from M. glacialis were analysed by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography using a Biosep-SEC S3000 column (300Â7.6 mm; Phenomenenx, Macclesfield, UK; exclusion range 5-700 kDa). Samples were eluted with ultra-highquality water at a flow rate of 1 ml min À1 , continuously monitored using a photodiode array (210-800 nm, Waters 996) and refractive index detector (Waters 2410). The column was calibrated with a gel filtration molecular weight marker kit (Sigma).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Monosaccharide analysis of mucus glycoproteins</head><p>The monosaccharide composition of partially purified mucus glycoproteins from M. glacialis was determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after methanolysis. Acid methanolysis of samples and standards was performed using 0.5 M HCl in dry methanol according to the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ferguson (2004)</ref>. The trimethylsilyl ethers of the neutral and amino sugars were determined by GC-MS. Uronic acids were determined in a separate experiment by the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Inoue and Miyawaki (1973)</ref>. Briefly, samples were methanolysed in 1.0 M methanolic HCl at 100 8C overnight, dried and analysed as their trimethylsilyl ethers by GC/MS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">NMR characterisation of mucus glycoprotein</head><p>Partially purified mucus glycoprotein from M. glacialis was dissolved in 99.8% D 2 O and transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube. One-dimensional 1 H and two-dimensional TOCSY spectra were recorded at 500 MHz, 70 8C, using a Varian Unity 500 NMR spectrometer, using pulse sequences supplied by the manufacturer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">FTIR characterisation of mucus PG</head><p>Partially purified mucus glycoproteins, from all three species, mammalian PGs, and mammalian mucins were analysed by means of FTIR spectroscopy, using a Nicolet Magna-IR 860 spectrometer ESP equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector and an Inspect Plus IR microscope attachment. Spectra were obtained by utilizing a single-bounce attenuated total reflection (ATR) zinc-selenide prism, and by transmission through KBr tablets, over the range 680-4000 cm À1 . For each spectrum, 32 scans were coadded at a spectral resolution of 4 cm À1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8.">Real-time adhesion assay</head><p>In order to assess the role of partially purified mucus glycoproteins in regulating bacterial adhesion, a flow chamber was built to carry out real-time video microscopy studies under flow.</p><p>A linear shear stress flow chamber was constructed using the design of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Usami et al. (1993)</ref> with minor modifications. The chamber was adapted in order to accommodate a removable microscope slide within a window in its base. A PTFE gasket separated the lid and base of the chamber, which were secured by eight screws. The thickness of the gasket determined the width of the gap within the flow chamber. A variety of blank gaskets were provided, within which windows could be cut with a scalpel and template. The assembly was designed in order to fit on the stage of an inverted fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert) and allow access to the whole area of the flow chamber.</p><p>Pseudomonas fluorescens (National Collection of Industrial Marine Bacteria, Pf 1079) were grown overnight at room temperature in Anderson's marine medium. Cultures were pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 250Âg) and washed three times with filtered seawater (0.22 Am, FSW). The washed bacteria were then resuspended in 5 ml of filtered seawater and stained with 5 Al of the vital fluorescent dye SYTOR 9 (Molecular Probes) for 10 min. The bacteria were then diluted to 50 ml and incubated for 1 h in seawater alone or in seawater containing 1 mg ml À1 of partially purified mucus glycoprotein, from all three species, or control mucin. Following this incubation, bacteria were transferred to the flow chamber.</p><p>Fluorescent-labelled bacteria were pumped into a sealed reservoir flask using a peristaltic pump. The speed of the pump was adjusted to give a flow rate of 0.025 ml s À1 in order to produced a linear range of shear of approximately 43-0 dyn cm À2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Usami et al., 1993)</ref>. New glass microscope slides (Gold Star washed, Phillip Harris) were fitted in the chamber for each experiment prior to pumping. The passage of bacteria through the chamber was recorded using a video camera (JVC, TK-C1381) mounted on the microscope. Short sequences were recorded in regions of low and high shear. On completion of recording, the chamber was flushed with filtered seawater for 5 min, and still photographs of the remaining adhered bacteria were taken.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9.">Bacterial adhesion assay</head><p>The effect of partially purified mucus glycoproteins, from all three species, on the adhesion of radiolabeled bacteria was measured in vitro. P. fluorescens (NCIMB, Pf 1079) were grown overnight at room temperature in Anderson's marine medium supplemented with 2.5 ACi. ml À1 [ 3 H]-methyl thymidine (Amersham). Cultures were pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 250Âg) and washed three times with FSW. Labelled bacteria were resuspended in FSW and incubated for 3 h at room temperature in 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning Costar). Bacteria were then discarded, and the plates were washed three times with FSW. Adhered bacteria were solubilised with 200 Al of 0.2 M NaOH, 1% SDS for 10 min and then neutralised with 200 Al of 0.2 M HCl. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting following the addition of 5 ml of Optiphase scintillation fluid (Zinnser Analytical).</p><p>The adhesion of P. fluorescens in response to a range of concentrations of soluble mucus and control PGs was measured on tissue culture plastic as described. The same samples were also used to coat the wells of tissue-culture plastic 96-well plates in order to measure the effect of adsorbed samples on the adhesion of P. fluorescens. Wells of 96-well plates were coated in triplicate with partially purified mucus glycoproteins (1 mg ml À1 ) poly-l-lysine (0.01%-1Â10 À6 %,) and proteoglycans (1 mg ml À1 -1Â10 À5 ml) prior to adhesion assays. Briefly, 200 Al of solution was incubated in each well for 1 h, after which the solution was discarded and the plates were air dried at 60 8C for 1 h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.10.">Neutrophil adhesion assay</head><p>In order to assess the effect of partially purified mucus glycoproteins, from all three species, on cellular adhesion, an assay that measures the interaction between leukocytes and human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) was used.</p><p>The adhesion assay used is based upon a method described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kyan-Aung et al. (1991)</ref>. In brief, cryopreserved HUVECs (TCS UK) were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium (MCDB 131) supplemented with foetal bovine serum (2%), hydrocortisone (1 ng ml À1 ), gentamicin (50 Ag ml À1 ), amphotericin-B (50 ng ml À1 ) and human epidermal growth factor (10 ng ml À1 ). Cells were passaged by trypsinisation (0.025% trypsin with 0.01% EDTA) and were grown to confluency in the central wells of flatbottomed 96-well plates in a volume of 200 Al of culture medium per well. For adhesion assays, cells were used at the fifth passage.</p><p>Monolayers of HUVECs were stimulated for 6 h with IL-1h (10 Uml À1 ) in the absence and presence of partially purified mucus GPs diluted in normal saline, or heparin (Multiparin) and polyglutamic acid controls. Following stimulation, monolayers were washed to remove stimuli and inhibitors, before the addition of 200 Al radiolabelled leukocyte suspension to each well (2Â10 5 cells per well). Following a 30-min incubation at 37 8C, nonadherent cells were removed by gentle aspiration and washing. The adherent cells in each well were lysed with 1% Nonidet-P40, placed in scintillation vials and counted on a g-counter. The composition of mucus collected from M. glacialis, P. pulvillus, and O. nigra. Protein concentration was measured using the Coomassie Plus reagent with standards of BSA diluted in filtered seawater. GAG concentration was measured using dimethylmethylene blue reagent with standards of chondroitin sulphate diluted in filtered seawater. </p></div>

In every case, the major sulphated polysaccharide containing peak eluted in the void volume, indicating the presence of a high molecular weight glycoconjugate.

Fifty milliliter of O. nigra mucus yielded approximately 5 mg of freeze-dried sample. Twenty milliliter of P. pulvillus mucus yielded approximately 3 mg of freeze-dried sample.</p><p>Analysis by the carbazole reaction and the modified Elson-Morgan reaction indicated that mucus glycoproteins from M. glacialis and P. pulvillus contained both hexuronic acid and hexosamine <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>. As no uronic acids were detected by GC-MS, it is likely neutral, and amine sugars, which are known to interfere with the carbazole reaction, were responsible for the levels detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">HPLC analysis of mucus</head><p>Typical chromatograms collected from crude mucus and dpartially purifiedT glycoprotein from M. glacialis are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>. The first peak [retention time (RT) = 5.6 min] in the crude mucus chromatograms corresponds to the peak collected from the Sepharose CL-6B column. The approximate molecular weight of this compound is 2.130Â10 6 Da. Other major components have the following retention times and approximate molecular masses: 9.9 min (MW = 17.6 kDa), 10.7 min (MW = 6.7 kDa), 11.2 min (MW = b kDa), and 11.58 min (MW = b 5 kDa). The RI chromatogram indicates a major component (RT = 11.4, N80% area) with a molecular mass of b5 kDa, which corresponds with the A 280 peak at 11.2 min. The partially purified material consists mainly of the high molecular weight peak (RT=5.6 min) seen in the crude material.  However, significant amounts of other components are seen, in particular peaks around 11 min. The RI chromatogram of the same material indicates just three major peaks corresponding to the high molecular weight peak and two peaks around 11 min. The 9.9-min A 280 peak seen in the crude material is eliminated from the purified material. These chromatograms indicate that the partially purified material contains lower molecular weight components that may be degradation products (e.g., oligosaccharides) of the high MW component.</p></div>

The partially purified glycoprotein consists mostly (N70%) of glucose, galactose, N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc), and N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc). No sialic acids or uronic acids were found. The composition of monosaccharides in all the samples is consistent with the presence of a mucin-type glycoprotein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">NMR spectroscopy of partially purified glycoprotein from M. glacialis</head><p>The proton spectrum of the M. glacialis glycoprotein at 500 MHz is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>. Signals attributable to both carbohydrate and peptide are present, and the distinctive acetyl methyl signal at 2.05 ppm is consistent with the high proportion of GalNAc and GlcNAc identified by monosaccharide analysis. Resonances between 4.4 and 5.2 ppm were identified as anomeric signals by means of a TOCSY spectrum (data not shown). A group of three sharp signals between 5.0 and 5.2 ppm is attributable to a-anomeric protons, with signals between 4.4 and 4.8 ppm from hanomers. The high complexity and viscosity of the NMR sample precluded more detailed assignment of carbohydrate or peptide signals in NMR spectra of the intact glycoprotein.   </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The mucus examined in this study has properties consistent with previously described echinoderm secretions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Canicatti and D'Ancona, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chaet, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fontaine, 1964)</ref>. The secretions are viscous and acidic liquids containing protein and sulphated polysaccharide. Preliminary experiments with HUVECs indicate the presence of Tentative peak assignments from FTIR spectra of mucus glycoproteins. Assignments based upon published spectra and on spectra of mucins and glycosaminoglycans of known structure. potent lytic substances in the raw mucus. This again is consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Canicatti, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Canicatti and D'Ancona, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fontaine, 1964)</ref> and is probably due to the presence of saponins <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Iorizzi, 1993)</ref>, although this was not investigated further. Lytic activity was removed by the size-exclusion chromatography procedure described, so that the resulting partially purified material was suitable for subsequent functional analysis. The partially purified glycoprotein consisted of a major component (~50%) of an approximately 2Â10 6 Da glyco-protein, and seven minor components of lower molecular mass (~2-4Â10 3 Da). These minor components could be either contaminants from incomplete fractionation or degradation products from the major component. The later possibility is supported by the fact that major components of the crude mucus, which are of intermediate molecular mass (~250Â10 3 Da), are eliminated by the fractionation. Chemical analyses of the partially purified mucus glycoproteins are consistent with the presence of mucin-type glycoprotein. FTIR analysis of this material from all three species produced very similar spectra, which were also consistent with spectra collected from mammalian mucins. The monosaccharides present in M. glacialis partially purified mucus glycoprotein were the same as those found in coral mucin by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Meikle et al. (1987)</ref>, but their proportions are substantially different. In the coral mucin, arabinose is the major component, making up nearly 50% of the sample, and GlcNAc and mannose being the other two major sugars. This analysis therefore strongly differentiates between mucins from coral and from M. glacialis. The occurrence of D-arabinose in animal glycoproteins is extremely unusual, having only been previously reported in two coral mucins <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Meikle et al., 1987)</ref>. Preliminary NMR analysis of M. glacialis partially purified glycoprotein also produced data consistent with a mucin-type glycoprotein. No analysis of the peptide portion of these glycoproteins was carried out. On the basis of the similarity of our data to better characterised mucins, one would expect a high proportion of serine and threonine residues as these are the sites for Oglycosidic linkages <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Meikle et al., 1987)</ref>. The partially purified material examined in this study is therefore likely to contain a mucin-type glycoprotein. This is likely to be the high molecular weight component of the partially purified material, and it is possible that the minor components of relatively low molecular weight represent subunits of this large molecule. It has been previously reported that echinoderm mucus secretions may contain proteoglycans <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(McKenzie and Grigovala, 1996)</ref>. These are ubiquitous glycoproteins, characterised as a core protein with one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hardingham and Fosang, 1992)</ref>. The core protein may also bear varying amounts of covalently attached N-and Olinked oligosaccharides. The GAGs have a linear repeating disaccharide structure of a hexosamine residue and a uronic acid residue up to approximately 100 residues. The lack of GPs heparin (hep) and dermatan sulphate (DS). The adhesion of radiolabelled P. fluorescens to tissue culture plastic was measured. Bacteria were incubated in the plates in filtered sea water with glycoproteins added in the concentration range 01 mg ml -1 . (b) Inhibition of leukocyte adhesion to HUVECs by mucus PGs and mammalian heparin. The adhesion of radiolabelled human neutrophils to HUVECs in the presence of heparin and mucus glycoproteins in the concentration range 0.01-100 mg ml -1 . Anticoagulant effects of partially purified mucus glycoprotein. Effects of mucus glycoproteins on the activated partial thromboplastin time (coagulation time in secondsFS.D.) of normal human plasma were compared to those of heparin.</p><p>any uronic acids in the monosaccharide analysis demonstrates that no proteoglycans are present in the partially purified glycoprotein fraction. The glycoprotein from M. glacialis and O. nigra were shown to block adhesion of bacteria in a static adhesion assay. Furthermore, when we examine the bacteria used for real-time studies, they are seen to have formed large aggregates, presumably due to adhesion to glycoprotein molecules. These results indicate that the mucus glycoproteins are capable of blocking the adhesion sites of, at least some, fouling organisms. The mucus glycoproteins from the filter feeder P. pulvillus enhanced adhesion of bacteria in the static bacterial adhesion assay, probably as part of this species' mechanism for trapping food particles from seawater. No effect was observed with the material from P. pulvillus in the real-time adhesion assay; although it is difficult to interpret this result as there may be a number of reasons why the two assays produced different results, e.g., flow as opposed to static, preincubation, shorter adhesion period. Marine invertebrates may therefore be able to secrete both antiadhesive and proadhesive mucus glycoproteins.</p><p>The role of surface glycoproteins, both secreted and membrane-bound, is one that appears to have been conserved through evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Har-El and Tanzer, 1993)</ref>. It was therefore not surprising that in our experiments the echinoderm mucus glycoproteins also acted to inhibit the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells. Initial weak tethering of circulating leukocytes to the endothelium is mediated by selectins followed by the activation of shearresistant adhesion mediated by integrins <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berg et al., 1993)</ref>. Among the ligands for the selectins are a number of endothelial mucins <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berg et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Shimizu and Shaw, 1993)</ref>, which are well placed to mediate the initial stage of leukocyte adhesion because of their extended structure that lifts them above the glycocalyx <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shimizu and Shaw, 1993)</ref>. The interaction between leukocyte selectins and endothelial cells is dependent on the expression of specific sugar motifs within mucin oligosaccharides and requires the sulphation of the oligosaccharides <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shimizu and Shaw, 1993)</ref>. We propose that the echinoderm mucins may act as competitive inhibitors of this interaction, being preferentially bound by the leukocyte receptors that mediate adhesion in the assay described.</p><p>Glycoconjugates, such as mucins, are present on all epithelial and endothelial surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Carlstedt and Davies, 1997)</ref>. These include a large number of well-characterised intrinsic membrane glycoproteins, as well as molecules of the extracellular matrix and secreted glycoproteins. They are, in most cases, the first point of contact for any cell or molecule approaching a surface. Glyconconjugates are ideally placed to regulate many different aspects of cell function including cell-cell interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kyan-Aung et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Misevic and Burger, 1993)</ref>, cell-matrix interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Masahito, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wesseling et al., 1995)</ref> and cell-ligand interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Yamada and Olden, 1978)</ref>.

The echinoderm surface is covered in a cuticle which is rich in glycoproteins, yet these surfaces are very good at resisting fouling <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(McKenzie and Grigovala, 1996)</ref>. The cuticle undoubtedly has properties which make it a low-adhesion surface <ref type="bibr">(i.e., dnonstickT;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McKenzie and Grigovala, 1996)</ref>, but these properties would not be effective in preventing fouling by organisms which specifically target cuticular components. We propose an antifouling system, whereby the dnonstickT properties of the cuticle are augmented by a mucus film. This film is the first feature encountered when an organism approaches the surface, allowing mucus glycoproteins to bind to fouling organisms before they reach the true surface. This hypothesis allows for the competitive inhibition of surface adhesion by organisms which have developed mechanisms to target cuticular glycoproteins. The protective function of secreted and membrane-bound mucins is widely accepted in mammalian biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carson et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Strous and Dekker, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Van Klinken et al., 1995)</ref>.

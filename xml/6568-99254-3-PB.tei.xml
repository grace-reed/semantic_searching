			<abstract>
				<p>Despite intensive study, many mysteries remain about the MYCN oncogene&apos;s functions. Here we focus on MYCN&apos;s role in neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial childhood cancer. MYCN gene amplification occurs in 20% of cases, but other recurrent somatic mutations are rare. This scarcity of tractable targets has hampered efforts to develop new therapeutic options. We employed a multilevel omics approach to examine MYCN functioning and identify novel therapeutic targets for this largely un-druggable oncogene. We used systems medicine based computational network reconstruction and analysis to integrate a range of omic techniques: sequencing-based transcriptomics, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, siRNA screening and interaction proteomics, revealing that MYCN controls highly connected networks, with MYCN primarily supressing the activity of network components. MYCN&apos;s oncogenic functions are likely independent of its classical heterodimerisation partner, MAX. In particular, MYCN controls its own protein interaction network by transcriptionally regulating its binding partners. Our network-based approach identified vulnerable therapeutically targetable nodes that function as critical regulators or effectors of MYCN in neuroblastoma. These were validated by siRNA knockdown screens, functional studies and patient data. We identified β-estradiol and MAPK/ERK as having functional cross-talk with MYCN and being novel targetable vulnerabilities of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. These results reveal surprising differences between the functioning of endogenous, overexpressed and amplified MYCN, and rationalise how different MYCN dosages can orchestrate cell fate decisions and cancerous outcomes. Importantly, this work describes a systems-level approach to systematically uncovering network based vulnerabilities and therapeutic targets for multifactorial diseases by integrating disparate omic data types.</p>

The oncogenic potential of the MYC gene family is ancient, and conserved throughout the metazoan lineage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, but the extent to which MYCN and the more widely expressed c-MYC (MYC) are just tissue-specific homologues or fulfil non-redundant functions is still unclear. Their protein sequences substantially diverge, and they are spatially and temporally differentially expressed (DE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Yet, they share many target genes, and Mycn, inserted into the c-Myc locus, can rescue the embryonic lethality of a c-Myc knockout mouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, a Mycn but not c-Myc conditional knockout can prevent Sonic hedgehog (SHH) induced medulloblastoma precursor cell proliferation in vitro and medulloblastoma formation in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>MYCN has been linked to numerous cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> and MYCN amplification status is the strongest single gene predictor of prognosis in neuroblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. About 20% of neuroblastoma patients have MYCN amplified (MNA) tumours, and are prone to treatment resistance, relapse, development of metastases and low survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Neuroblastoma accounts for the highest proportion of all childhood cancer deaths <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, on account of this MNA patient cohort. Yet, a complete picture of oncogenic MYCN function or a conceptual integration of its different molecular roles is still absent. This is partly due to MYCN being a broadly acting, but weak transcription factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and because it has other functions that include global interactions with the epigenetic and chromatin remodelling machineries <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Therapeutic approaches to tackle high-risk MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma are lacking, and a disproportionate number of high-risk individuals die or suffer treatment related morbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. While some progress appears to be on the horizon <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> new therapeutic approaches need to be identified.</p><p>The paucity of recurrent somatic mutations in neuroblastoma has hampered classical genetic approaches, which rely on frequently altered oncogenic drivers, to identify novel targets for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. To overcome this obstacle we have taken a network-based approach to elucidate novel therapeutic targets for MNA neuroblastoma, which focuses on the functional status of downstream biological networks rather than the heterogeneous upstream mutation and epigenetic events. In order to map these networks we took an unbiased integrative omics approach combining transcriptomic analysis of MYCN target genes (4sUseq, mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq) with MYCN DNAbinding analysis (ChIP-seq) and proteomic identification of MYCN-binding proteins (mass spectrometry) under different conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). To investigate how MYCN regulates its downstream effector networks we took a network centred approach, where we analysed the effects of MYCN on different types of molecular networks and then connected them via shared functionalities. The resulting networks were then validated using drug treatments of cell lines, a druggable-genome RNAi knockdown screen, and neuroblastoma patient data. Of the analysis approaches utilised on the omic data we found that integration at the level of transcriptional regulators provided the best framework for both identifying novel therapeutic targets and stratification of patients.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integration of overexpressed and amplified MYCN omics</head><p>Although important for the genesis of neuroblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>, MYCN overexpression without gene amplification is often associated with good outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. However, MNA is the strongest predictor of poor clinical outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Therefore, we compared MYCN overexpressing and amplified MYCN cells. By applying a variety of omics technologies and systems level analysis approaches, we investigated the global functioning of the MYCN oncogene in both an overexpressed and amplified setting ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). Overexpressed MYCN was examined in the MYCN inducible cell line SY5Y-MYCN. As due to the heterogeneous nature of the amplification process, no single representative MNA model exists, we also used a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines which broadly represent the range of neuroblastoma, from MYCN single copy to amplified, and which cover a wide range of MYCN expression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B)</ref>.</p><p>We found that integration of the data at the level of transcriptional regulators provided the best framework for identifying novel therapeutic targets for further validation. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) suite was used to identify the inferred transcriptional regulators (ITRs) of differentially expressed (DE) genes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>). This analysis uses statistical algorithms to match observed DE genes to known gene regulatory modules from the curated IPA knowledge database, thus inferring the regulator(s) of a set of genes based on the known patterns of genes regulated by a specific gene, protein or chemical compound <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. This analysis also extracts information about the activation status of the ITR molecules, based on the concept that downstream transcriptional target activity reflects the activation status of their upstream regulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>). analysis approach. B. MYCN mRNA expression in each mRNA-seq sample. CPMkb: counts per million adjusted by gene length in kilobases. Single-read runs are denoted by (sr), with the remainder of the samples being generated by paired-end runs. The time after the SY5Y-MYCN samples indicates the duration of MYCN induction, with 0h being un-induced. C. Schematic overview of how the inferred transcriptional regulators (ITRs) of a set of differentially expressed (DE) genes are identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrative omics of MYCN reveals a function as a transcriptional repressor</head><p>MYCN overexpression predominantly repressed target gene expression at the levels of mRNA, miRNA (4h and 24h after MYCN induction) and non-protein coding RNA <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2A</ref>). MYCN expression levels rapidly increased after induction in the SY5Y-MYCN line ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1A</ref>). RNA-seq results were validated by qPCR for selected targets ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1B</ref>). In addition to standard mRNA-seq where total mRNA is profiled, we employed 4sU pulse labelling of newly-transcribed mRNA (label added for the last 30min before extraction), for the uninduced, 1h and 4h MYCN overexpression time-points, for an in-depth description of the experiment see Schwarzl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. The enrichment of actively transcribed genes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1C</ref>), achieved by 4sU pulse labelling of newly-transcribed mRNA, enabled the identification of previously undetectable early stage MYCN targets ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  S1D</ref>). Importantly, MYCN mediated gene regulation did not just amplify the previous expression state of a gene, but acted independently of the gene's initial expression level ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>).</p><p>Pair-wise comparison of the MNA lines showed that the number of upregulated genes tended to increase with higher MNA levels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2C</ref>). In contrast to overexpression, MYCN amplification predominantly upregulated targets ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2D</ref>) with over four times more genes positively than negatively correlating to MYCN expression. The genes regulated by amplified and overexpressed MYCN were largely different ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  S1E</ref>), indicating a switch in targets rather than differential regulation of the same genes. Thus, MYCN's effect on target gene expression is fundamentally different depending on whether it is overexpressed (repressor) or amplified (activator).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MYCN preferentially binds to gene enhancers and its oncogenic functions are largely independent of its canonical binding partner MAX</head><p>Both overexpressed and amplified MYCN predominantly bound to gene enhancers (ChIP-seq), while binding to gene body regions showed a clear preference for introns ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A)</ref>. As expected the RNAPolII ChIPseq control showed preferential binding to promotors ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2A</ref>). MYCN bound to many transcriptional targets within gene bodies, matching recently reported gene body methylation sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, suggesting that MYCN may be directing the subsequent methylation of its targets. Previous global MYCN genome binding assays generally used ChIP-chip with promoter enriched microarrays, therefore missing the enhancer binding detected by our unbiased ChIP-seq approach. Similar to our human MYCN analysis, a previous study of MYCN genome binding in mice which also used ChIP-seq revealed that only 33% of MYCN binding peaks were located within promoter regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> (see www.cistrome.org database).</p><p>We found evidence that oncogenic MYCN regulates gene expression independent of the classic c-MYC and MYCN heterodimer partner MAX. There was a lack of E-box binding upon MYCN overexpression or amplification (MYCN ChIP-seq) according to SIOMICS motif finder analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> (data not shown). Similarly, MAX was not a top transcription factor associated with overexpressed and amplified MYCN's genomic targets using the DiRE <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> tool, with a very small proportion of the MYCN bound genes having known MAX regulatory elements ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2B</ref>). Supporting this interpretation, MAX mRNA expression levels were consistent across all cell lines tested regardless of their MNA status or the level of MYCN expressed ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2C</ref>), while MXD1 and MXI1 tended to increase with higher MYCN expression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2D</ref>). MXD1 and MXI1 both sequester MAX <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37]</ref>, preventing MYCN binding. Consistent with this, when the DE genes were analysed for their known transcriptional regulators using IPAs' inferred transcriptional regulators (ITRs) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, MYCN activation outstripped MAX activation levels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  3B</ref>). In addition, when highly MNA cells (KCNR) were compared with MYCN single copy cells (SY5Y), MAX was not an ITR of the DE genes.</p><p>We next assessed these findings in a wellcharacterised neuroblastoma tumour microarray dataset comprising 478 patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>, where we found no correlation between MAX and MYCN mRNA levels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3C</ref>). Likewise, whereas MYCN is the strongest single gene indicator of patient outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, there was no strong correlation between MAX expression and overall patient survival ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3D</ref>). Furthermore, while MYCN knockdown reduced the viability of both induced and non-induced SY5Y-MYCN cells, MAX knockdown showed no significant (t-test, p-value 0.3094) reduction ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3E</ref>) further supporting the independence of MYCN and MAX functions in neuroblastoma. MYCN knockdown has previously been shown to reduce cell viability specifically in MNA neuroblastoma cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>. Together, our data suggest that most of the specific oncogenic functions of MYCN only occur upon MAX saturation and are independent of MAX binding, supporting a recently proposed hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">41]</ref>. Therefore, binding partners other than MAX are likely more relevant to driving MYCN-mediated poor neuroblastoma outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MYCN transcriptionally regulates its own interaction partners</head><p>To determine binding partners other than MAX which could contribute to oncogenic MYCN functions we   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>). When these 415 proteins were analysed for their known transcriptional regulators, by ITR analysis, MYCN was the top ITR, and c-MYC (the MYCs share many redundant functions and targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>) was third ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>). Thus, MYCN is capable of re-wiring its own interactome through the transcriptional regulation of its interaction partners, which likely contributes to the differences between overexpressed and amplified MYCN functions. The other 3 molecules in the top 5 ITRs were drugs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>), i.e. sirolimus (rapamycin) targeting mTORC1, which inhibits neuroblastoma proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>; 5-Fluoro-Uracil (5-FU), an inhibitor of DNA synthesis used in cancer therapy including neuroblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>; and CD437, a retinoid acid analogue that induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>. These results indicate an intriguing overlap of amplified MYCN function with drugs that are used in cancer therapy and regulate cell growth (rapamycin), DNA synthesis (5-FU), and apoptosis (CD437).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response kinetics of overexpressed MYCN target genes are temporally dynamic, but regulatory mechanisms are conserved</head><p>To elucidate how MYCN alters cell fate, we next applied a systems level analysis to examine global network properties of overexpressed and amplified MYCN. The response of individual genes differentially expressed upon MYCN overexpression was highly temporally dynamic as seen at the DNA binding, mRNA and miRNA levels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S4A</ref>-C). Therefore, to better extract meaning from both the time-course and the various omic platforms we integrated the datasets at a systems level, using pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis, network reconstruction, and inferring the transcriptional regulators. This integration revealed a much higher degree of overlap than gene level integration, both in the temporal and the cross-platform data ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S4D)</ref>. Similarly, the MYCN interacting proteins remained rather consistent across the time-course ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S4E</ref>) suggesting that overexpressed MYCN functional changes are mediated by a similar set of MYCN interacting proteins despite the temporally dynamic response of target genes.</p><p>Given that the protein interactors of overexpressed MYCN were largely temporally consistent ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S4E</ref>), but that amplified MYCN bound to many proteins not bound by overexpressed MYCN ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>) we next assessed whether the transcriptional regulators driving differential gene expression were different between MYCN overexpression and amplification. ITR analysis of the various RNA-seq samples revealed that overexpressed MYCN (48h) and amplified MYCN share a core set of transcriptional regulators accounting for approximately 40% of their top 100 transcriptional regulators <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. However, beyond these core regulators overexpressed and amplified MYCN functioning diverged, with over 70% of the ITRs (of the top 100 ITRs in each MNA line compared to MYCN single copy cells) being common to the MNA cell lines <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. Interestingly, there was 71% overlap between the MNA cell lines with the lowest and highest level of MYCN expression, but only 43% overlap between the matched MYCN expression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S3A</ref>) cell lines KCN and 48h overexpression SY5Y-MYCN ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>, showing that the differing levels of overlap are not due to dosage effects. Therefore, there exists a large cohort of proteins which bind exclusively to amplified MYCN ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A</ref>), which are likely responsible for the diverging transcriptional regulation seen between overexpressed and amplified MYCN.</p><p>Among the amplified and overexpressed MYCN's conserved effects was regulation of the axonal guidance signalling pathway, which was the top ranked pathway at both 24h and 48h of MYCN overexpression, and between each of the MNA lines and SY5Y <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1</ref>). In addition to their role in neuronal development, axonal guidance genes are also involved in tumourigenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>. Interestingly, many components of sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling were downregulated by 4h ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S5A</ref>). The expression of SHH pathway proteins is suppressed in tumours of   <ref type="table">Table  S2</ref>, the majority of both were downregulated.</p><p>MNA patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>, suggesting that inhibition of SHH signalling contributes to MYCN initiated transformation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Both overexpressed and amplified MYCN primarily supress cellular networks</head><p>We next examined the effect of amplified and overexpressed MYCN on global cellular signalling networks, using ITR and GO term analysis. This revealed that the majority of early time-point DE genes we identified are novel MYCN targets, as c-MYC and MYCN were only top ITRs at 48h ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4B</ref>). Mirroring the gene expression level, MYCN overexpression predominantly inhibited ITRs and GO terms ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4C</ref>, <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>). Although overexpressed MYCN controls a diverse array of genes and functions, the core ITRs common in at least 2 time-points, form a highly connected regulatory network ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S5B</ref>, <ref type="table">Table S3</ref>). This network consists of both known (e.g. NTRKs, TGFβ, p53, BRDs and RXRs) and novel (e.g. NUPRs, HIFs and MAPKs) MYCN interactors and neuroblastoma regulators.</p><p>Similar to MYCN overexpression, the MNA lines showed a high degree of overlap between the top ITRs <ref type="table">(Table S4</ref>) and pathways of each line ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S6A)</ref>. Again, the majority of ITRs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S6B</ref>, including 14 of the top 15) and GO terms were inhibited with increasing MNA levels. This suggests that despite the differences in gene level regulation by overexpressed and amplified MYCN, both MYCN states primarily function through the repression of cellular networks, suggesting that MNA enhances oncogenesis predominantly through suppressing signalling pathways and transcriptional regulators. Genes from numerous cancer pathways were differentially expressed not only between MYCN single copy and MNA cell lines, but also between the patient-matched MNA lines KCN and KCNR ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure S7A)</ref>.</p><p>We further assessed how overexpressed and amplified MYCN differ in their regulation of cell fate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparing 48h MYCN overexpression (SY5Y-MCYN)</head><p>with amplification (KCNR) revealed that, while some similarities exist between overexpressed and amplified MYCN functions, there are considerable differences ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure S7B)</ref>. Generally, the GO terms common to both lines and those unique to SY5Y-MYCN tended to be weighted more heavily towards normal processes, while the KCNR unique terms were more heavily weighted towards disease ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure S7B</ref>), supporting the hypothesised link between MYCN dosage and molecular oncogenic functioning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network analysis reveals therapeutically targetable nodes: MAPK/ERK pathway</head><p>Given the findings that oncogenic MYCN functioning occurs primarily independent of MAX signalling and that regulatory differences exist between overexpressed and amplified MYCN, we next used our MNA network and ITR analysis to identify oncogenic MYCN co-regulators which represent therapeutically targetable nodes. Of the top 100 ITRs per cell line 62 <ref type="table">(Table S5)</ref> were common to all 3 metastatic MNA lines (IMR32, Kelly and KCNR). When the protein ITRs were connected based on known protein-protein interactions (drug ITRs excluded), they formed a highly interconnected interaction network ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5A</ref>), which was significantly (p=4.210E-9) enriched for MAPK (ERK) signalling (14 of 53 components) based on String's KEGG pathway enrichment tool. Of the components of this network which were present in the druggable-genome siRNA screen, 21 strongly (by at least +/-1 log2FC) altered cell viability when knocked down ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5B</ref>, <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>). The MYCN overexpression ITR network (ITRs present in at least two RNA-seq time-points, ( <ref type="figure">Figure S8A</ref>) was also enriched for MAPK signalling genes (String's KEGG pathway enrichment tool, p=1.35E-13). In addition, amplified MYCN proteins physically interacted with 19 components of the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway in KCN cells (IPA, p-value of overlap = 6.46E-06). None of these MAPK component proteins have previously known interactions with MYCN ( <ref type="figure">Figure S8B</ref>).</p><p>We therefore examined MAPK ITRs present in the RNA-seq analysis. Of these MAPK1 (ERK2) was the highest ranked ITR and its activation further increased upon both MYCN overexpression and amplification ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5C</ref>). Intriguingly, the MYCN ChIP-seq data revealed that MYCN bound to the first intron of the MAPK1 gene in all cell lines tested ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5D</ref>). Additionally, MAP2K1 (MEK1), the direct regulator of MAPK1, was one of the novel protein-protein interactors of amplified MYCN ( <ref type="figure">Figure S8B</ref>). Interestingly, MAPK1 knockdown reduced SY5Y-MYCN cell viability in a MYCN dosage dependent manner ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5B</ref>). ERK pathway activation has been previously observed in NF1 mutated neuroblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>, but not previously found correlated with MYCN expression levels. All neuroblastoma lines tested showed reduced viability upon ERK pathway inhibition using the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 (PD184352) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5E</ref>). Therefore, our findings reveal a number of novel points of functional cross-talk between MYCN and the MAPK signalling pathway, suggesting that ERK inhibition could be a viable target not only for NF1 mutated, but neuroblastoma in general including MNA neuroblastoma.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network analysis reveals therapeutically targetable nodes: β-estradiol</head><p>Interestingly, the ITR analysis of the MNA cell lines revealed that despite them being phenotypically diverse they share common regulatory mechanisms, with a remarkable degree of similarity between the top ITRs and their extent of activation/inhibition in each MNA line compared to SY5Y ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6A</ref>). TGFB1 was the top ITR in each of the four MNA lines, and was strongly inhibited. MYCN has previously been shown to repress TGFβ signalling through the activation of miR-17-92 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>. As the ITR analysis can also include chemical compounds as regulators, we employed it to identify the top chemical regulators associated with neuroblastoma ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6A</ref>). The chemical ITRs showing inhibition in MNA cells versus MYCN single copy cells present candidate therapeutics for MNA neuroblastoma, as treating MNA cells with these drugs could conceivably compromise the detrimental effects of MYCN. ITR analysis correctly identified alltrans Retinoic Acid (RA, Tretinoin), and 5-aza-2'-dC (Decitabine). RA is used clinically to treat neuroblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[49]</ref>, and Decitabine is currently in clinical trials for neuroblastoma. These results provided confidence in the ITR analysis and prompted us to assess the top chemical ITR, β-estradiol.</p><p>β-estradiol was inhibited across the MNA lines and upon MYCN overexpression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6A, 6B)</ref>. Conversely, β-estradiol is activated when SY5Y-MYCN cells are induced to differentiate with RA ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6B</ref>). β-estradiol was also a top ITR when considering genes bound by overexpressed MYCN in SY5Y-MYCN and amplified MYCN in KCN and KCNR cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6C</ref>). Interestingly, MYCN overexpression or amplification conferred sensitivity to β-estradiol treatment, resulting in reduced neuroblastoma cell viability ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6D</ref>), although the extent of β-estradiol ITR inhibition did not correlate solely with amplified MYCN expression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure  6B</ref>). Un-induced SY5Y-MYCN cells and parental SY5Y cells induced to differentiate into neurons with a day RA pre-treatment were completely resistant to β-estradiol treatment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6D</ref>), indicating that this could be a promising MYCN targeted therapy producing little offtarget neuronal damage. The canonical receptors for β-estradiol are the Estrogen receptors (ERs). ER signalling was also an ITR of all overexpressed MYCN ChIP-seq time-points and amplified MYCN ( <ref type="figure">Figure S9A</ref>). The ER pathway was also enriched in amplified MYCN specific protein interactors ( <ref type="figure">Figure S9B</ref>). While the number of ER pathway proteins binding MYCN protein increased somewhat upon overexpression, amplified MYCN showed a vast increase ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6E)</ref>. Thus, the sensitivity of neuroblastoma cell lines to β-estradiol may correlate with the proteins interacting specifically with MYCN.</p><p>To assess whether these results were more generally applicable to neuroblastoma tumour biology we examined the cell line ITR analysis results for β-estradiol in the well-characterised neuroblastoma tumour microarray dataset comprising 478 patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>. The activity of the β-estradiol ITR was inhibited in MNA cell lines, and 24h and 48h MYCN overexpression. A gene signature was generated using the DE genes upon which the inhibition of this ITR was based <ref type="table">(Table S6</ref>). Only genes that were DE in at least two cell lines were used. The β-estradiol ITR signatures showed predictive ability, correctly segregating patient survival cohorts ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6F</ref>). Therefore, our systems level analysis not only identifies novel therapeutic targets, but also simultaneously identifies specific signatures for each target which could be used to potentially stratify patients into treatment groups.</p><p>Further supporting the likelihood of their therapeutic potential β-estradiol and MAPK1 were all ITRs of the 674 genes that strongly reduced SY5Y-MYCN cell viability when knocked down in the high-throughput RNAi screen ( <ref type="figure">Figure S9C</ref>). Three of the top four ITRs from this RNAi screen (TNF, TGFB1 and β-estradiol) were also in the top four ITRs of the MYCN amplified versus single copy cell analysis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6A</ref>), revealing a remarkable ability of ITR analysis to identify relevant regulators of neuroblastoma even from highly disparate experimental approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differentiation therapy sensitises MNA cells to the therapeutic targeting of the MYCN oncogenic network</head><p>MYCN amplification inhibits neuroblastoma differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">51]</ref>. Our RNA-seq GO term analysis confirmed that MNA cells were less differentiated in terms of neuritogenesis than MYCN single-copy SY5Y ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S10A</ref>). Having identified the regulator networks through which amplified MYCN orchestrates its effects, we next assessed the phenotypic effect of perturbing network components. MAPK (MEK) inhibition (CI-1040) in the MNA cell line IMR32, not only reduced cell viability, but surviving cells became more differentiated in appearance, with longer neurite outgrowths and narrower cell bodies ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 7A, 7B and S10B)</ref>. Similarly, cells not killed by β-estradiol treatment also became more differentiated ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 7A, 7B and S10B)</ref>. Interestingly, MAPK inhibition and β-estradiol treatment altered the cellular phenotype by a similar extent ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7B)</ref>. RA is used clinically to differentiate neuroblastoma but is not as effective for MNA tumours as MYCN single copy ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref>. We therefore compared the level of differentiation achieved by RA with CI-1040 and β-estradiol treatment. CI-1040 and β-estradiol induced a level of differentiation on a par with RA ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 7A,  7B and S10B</ref>). Combination treatment with RA and CI-1040 did not increase the level of differentiation obtained beyond that of RA only treatment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7B</ref>). However, the β-estradiol and RA combination significantly enhanced the level of differentiation obtained, compared with singleagent treatment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7B</ref>, t-test: p&lt;0.0001). Although none of the treatments fully differentiated IMR32 cells, a propensity to make any cells not killed by CI-1040 or β-estradiol more differentiated and less stem-like would still be an added benefit of such therapy. The DE genes contributing to the identification of β-estradiol as an ITR of the mRNA-seq data was used to generate a gene signature. Only genes which were DE in at least 2 cell lines were used. This signature for β-estradiol (bottom) was predictive of neuroblastoma patient outcome.</p><p>We next assessed the effect of co-treatment on cell viability. RA had little effect on the viability of IMR32 cells. However, upon combination treatment RA further sensitised the cells to MAPK (MEK1/2) inhibition (CI-1040) and β-estradiol. The combination treatment more than doubled the loss of viability over that seen in CI-1040 only treated cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7C</ref>). Taken together, these results show that both CI-1040 and β-estradiol hold potential as therapeutic agents for MNA neuroblastoma, both as single agents and in combination with other clinically utilised therapeutics, such as RA. The majority of MNA neuroblastoma cells were killed by these compounds, with surviving cells being more differentiated in appearance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION MYCN globally supresses cellular networks and re-wires its own interactome</head><p>Our data suggest that MYCN, like c-MYC <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">54]</ref>, has both transcriptional activator and repressor functions. This recently re-asserted view <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">54]</ref> qualifies the previously reported function of c-MYC as a general transcriptional enhancer that only amplifies the expression of already activated genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">56]</ref>. We show that MYCN-regulated transcription differs depending on whether MYCN was amplified (predominantly activated) or overexpressed (predominantly repressed). Despite this, both overexpressed and amplified MYCN mainly suppressed the activity of transcriptional regulator networks. Oncogenic MYCN therefore achieves its harmful effects primarily through the suppression of downstream effector networks.</p><p>Interestingly, MYCN transcriptionally regulates the expression of many of its protein interaction partners, thus altering the landscape and functionality of the MYCN interactome. Amplified MYCN was a more promiscuous binder than overexpressed MYCN, having many more binding partners, even when cell lines with similar protein levels of overexpressed or amplified MYCN are compared ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S3</ref>). In addition, other factors that contribute to MNA-driven neuroblastoma were recently identified. They include the co-amplification of MYCN with lncUSMycN, a long non-coding RNA upstream of the MYCN locus, and NCYM, a protein transcribed from the anti-sense strand that inhibits GSK3β <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">58]</ref>. Combined, these findings help explain the differing prognosis of neuroblastoma patients with elevated or amplified MYCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The re-wiring of its own interactome, saturation of MAX and suppression of cellular networks likely contributes to aberrant MYCN function, driving the divergent phenotypes of normal and oncogenic MYCN signalling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of targetable vulnerabilities with therapeutic potential</head><p>Our study also demonstrates that applying an integrated omics approach, rather than using single omic technologies in isolation, facilitates rapid cross-platform validation and is capable of elucidating disease-relevant molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, analysis of the omics data at a systems level as opposed to gene level enables easier integration, overcoming complications arising from each individual platform. Such analysis accurately revealed disease-relevant networks and highlighted therapeutically targetable vulnerable nodes. Crucially, we validated a network-based approach to overcome the limitations of classical genetic approaches to therapeutic target identification in complex multifactorial diseases, such as neuroblastoma, which lack frequently altered genetic drivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</p><p>Our MYCN integrative omic analysis revealed a host of known genes, pathways and drugs that were previously associated with neuroblastoma, including p53, TGFβ,TNF, IFNG, Retinoic Acid and epigenetic modifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">49]</ref>. While these confirmatory findings bolster confidence in the analysis, our data also provide a wealth of information regarding potential novel therapeutic targets for MNA neuroblastoma, ranging from epigenetic regulators to classical signalling pathway components. Mapping the upstream regulator networks that drive DE genes in highly MNA cells compared with MYCN single copy cells elucidated several central nodes not previously linked to MNA neuroblastoma (e.g. HRAS, MAPK1, RAF1, NEUROG1 and ER).</p><p>MAPK was the most enriched pathway in an analysis of ITRs common to the metastatic MNA cell lines. The MAPK1 gene was bound by MYCN, and MAPK1 became progressively more activated with increasing levels of MYCN amplification. There is an emerging role of MAPK signalling in neuroblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[61]</ref>, including the occurrence of MAPK pathway mutations in relapsed tumours <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[65]</ref>. Here, we show that MYCN interacts with the MAPK pathway at numerous levels, including through protein-protein interactions with component proteins of the pathway, revealing that MAPK can play a role in neuroblastoma even before MAPK mutations occur. Furthermore, we found that neuroblastoma cells are susceptible to MEK inhibition, which could prove to be therapeutically beneficial as potent MEK inhibitors are available for clinical use <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[66]</ref>, with CI-1040 itself being orally active <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[67]</ref>. Additionally, we revealed that co-treatment of RA and CI-1040 can further sensitise metastatic MNA cells to MAPK inhibition, more than doubling the observed loss of viability.</p><p>Like CI-1040, orally active forms of β-estradiol exist, with β-estradiol being clinically approved for a range of conditions, and in advanced clinical trials (stage 3 and 4) for many others, including breast and prostate cancer (IPA database and www.clinicaltrials.gov). MNA cells were preferentially affected by β-estradiol treatment, which indicates potential utility as a targeted therapy. To this end we also report a gene signature capable of stratifying patients based on their β-estradiol activity status.</p><p>Interestingly, both β-estradiol and Estrogen receptor signalling were identified as ITRs of the MNA cells (compared with MYCN single-copy cells), but they showed an inverse activation status. β-estradiol was inhibited in MYCN amplified cells, whereas Estrogen receptor signalling (estrogen receptors are the primary receptor of β-estradiol) was activated. Similarly, β-estradiol was activated upon induction of differentiation, whereas estrogen receptor signalling was inhibited. This apparent contradiction is resolved by the fact that β-estradiol can bind a number of other proteins including AR, SHBG, NCOA3, NCOA2, Ste, CYP3A4, Iebp, AFP, ERBB2, GST A1-1 and NR0B1 (IPA database). Indeed, the target genes contributing to the identification of the ERs and β-estradiol ITR were largely different reflecting the fact that β-estradiol likely alters neuroblastoma cell fate mainly independently of its estrogen receptor functions. Estrogen receptor activation has recently been linked to increased proliferation, migration and invasion of MYCN single-copy SY5Y cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[68]</ref>. We observed no loss of viability when MYCN single-copy cells were treated with β-estradiol. However, our results demonstrate the specific anti-oncogenic potential of β-estradiol in MYCN amplified neuroblastoma, where it reduces cell viability and partially removes the MYCN mediated differentiation block.</p><p>Given the high degree of connectedness between the novel and already established therapeutically targetable nodes our analysis identified, opportunities are likely to exist for exploiting synergies by simultaneously targeting multiple vulnerabilities. We demonstrated the benefit of such combination approaches by simultaneously activating RA signalling and either treating with β-estradiol or inhibiting MAPK signalling. Targeting vulnerabilities in the amplified MYCN regulatory network not only reduced cell viability but also impaired MYCN's ability to inhibit differentiation. While targeting a single node did not fully remove IMR32's resistance to RA mediated differentiation, co-treatments were synergistic at reducing overall cell viability. Therefore, CI-1040 or β-estradiol combination treatments with RA would likely enhance the therapeutic potential of RA in MNA tumours.</p><p>The relevance of the network parameters obtained from the cell line omics data to patient outcome was verified both in terms of predicting correlations in expression between genes and by segregating patient outcome. This provides further confidence that our results reflect the true underlying biology of MYCN and are applicable to the clinical setting. Our analysis approach not only identified potential drug targets but simultaneously provided a predictive gene signature to inform personalised treatment strategies. Aside from new targets this approach could also potentially be used to generate stratification signatures for already clinically validated treatments with heterogeneous patient responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Oncogenic MYCN re-wires its own interaction and signalling networks to repress regulators of normal cellular developmental processes, such as differentiation. By reconstructing the MYCN network we identified novel therapeutically targetable vulnerabilities.

Before the high-throughput screening, cell number was titrated to ensure that cell proliferation remained in a linear exponential phase throughout the experiment. The siRNA library targeting human druggable genome (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) consists of four siRNAs per gene. These four siRNAs per gene were pooled into the same well (final assay concentration 50nM) on 384-well white, clear-bottom assay plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany), followed by addition of siLentFect (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using a Multidrop 384 Microplate Dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1h at room temperature. Cell suspension (1500 cells per well) was thereafter overlaid and the plates were incubated for 72 h at +37°C. Cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo Luminescence Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with Envision Platereader (PerkinElmer/Wallac) according to manufacturer's instructions. The raw data were normalized using "loesssamp" normalization method, implemented in R (R Core Team, 2014 http://www.r-project.org/), omitting plate rows 1-2 and 23-24 from normalisation which contain controls, and thereby normalizing the "sample fraction" of the plate, only.

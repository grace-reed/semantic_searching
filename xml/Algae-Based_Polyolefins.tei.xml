				<p>Polyolefins are synthetic polymers comprising olefinic monomers. Several million metric tons of polyolefins are produced and consumed annually all over the world. Owing to wide range of properties, many potential applications, and comparatively low cost, they have gained much attention in recent years. They are recyclable and their properties can be improved significantly via blending and composite technologies [1]. They can be categorized on the basis of their monomeric unit and chain structure as ethylene-based polyolefins, propylene-based polyolefins, higher polyolefins, and polyolefin elastomers. Linear chains of ethylene-based polyolefins are mostly obtained at low pressure using transitions metals as catalysts, whereas branched chains of different crystallinity levels and densities are produced at high pressure with oxygen or peroxide initiators [2,3]. Propylene-based polyolefins and higher polyolefins are produced using transition metal catalysts resulting in stereospecific and linear chain structures [4]. By combining ethylene and propylene, polyolefin elastomers [5] are produced with metal or single-site catalysts in the presence or absence of dienes (for cross-linking) and they are usually amorphous with high molecular weight and heterogeneous in phase structures. Polyolefins have diverse applications and are used to manufacture various products such as containers, home appliances, automotive parts, toys, engineering plastics, grocery bags, adhesives, and prosthetic implants. They behave as thermoplastic elastomers, thermosets, or thermoplastics and may be amorphous or highly crystalline [6e8]. They can be extruded as films, pipes/profiles, and fibers; molded into different shapes, and coated onto other materials [9]. Depending on the number of olefinic monomers, polyolefins may be classified into homopolymers, copolymers [10], or terpolymers [11], and on the basis of chain conformation, configuration, and processing conditions, they may be categorized as crystalline or amorphous. Homopolymers, copolymers, and terpolymers are the base materials for polyolefinic blends and composites, which are obtained by radical or</p>

Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polybutene-1, polymethylpentene-1, and higher polyolefins are homopolymers and their structures are given in <ref type="table">Table 13</ref>.1 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The global polyolefin companies produce PE and PP in large amounts compared with other homopolyolefins <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. PE may be present in several forms that differ in density levels, chain structures, and crystallinity, such as low-density PE (LDPE), linear low-density PE (LLDPE), high-density PE (HDPE), ultrahigh-molecular-weight PE, and ultralow-density PE. PP is present in three stereospecific forms (isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic) of varying densities <ref type="bibr">[12e14]</ref>. Polyolefin copolymers are random or block copolymers of the same or different monomers and may be single phase or heterophasic based on the quantity of comonomer, the polymerization catalyst, and the processes, e.g., ethyleneepropylene rubber <ref type="bibr">[15e17]</ref>. A renowned example of terpolymer is ethyleneepropyleneediene monomer [18e20]. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.2">SYNTHESIS OF BIOBASED OLEFINIC MONOMERS</head><p>The products that come from biobased feedstock represent only a small fraction of the chemical industry's yield. Efforts are carried out to shift the dependence of chemical industry from nonrenewable to renewable raw materials for chemical production owing to the rapid increase in the mineral oil price and a rising concern about the dwindling of these resources in the near future. The production of plant biomass all over the world is vast and is more than enough to meet the demand for the coproduction of materials, fuels, and chemicals along with the demand for feeds and foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Optimal exploitation of agricultural and forest residue, waste biomass, and nonused land permit the further development of the biobased industry provided the economic and technological limitations are overcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Much attention is being paid to the preparation and application of biobased polymers (derived from living organisms such as plants, trees, and algae or any polymer applicable for biomaterials) [24e30], which are classified into three classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> as given below:</p><p>1. Polymers directly extracted from biomass (with or without modification), e.g., polymers derived from cellulose and starch.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.2.1">BIOETHYLENE</head><p>In the early 20th century in Western Europe, biobased ethylene was produced by dehydration of ethanol and till the 1980s it was used only in few countries for industrial applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. A part of this ethylene was used to prepare PE, whereas the remaining was used to produce polyvinyl chloride and styrene. The polymerization of biobased ethylene is similar to the method for polymerizing petrochemical ethylene, and the first company that offered biobased PE at a commercial scale is a Brazilian company, Braskem. Bioethanol-based PE has similar properties as petroleum-based PE <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Nowadays, microbial ethanol is being produced on large scale by fermentation of sugar (from sugar cane), starch (from corn), and lignocellulosic feedstocks (from corn stalks, wood, and other plant wastes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Bioethanol is further dehydrated to ethylene by using different catalysts such as activated alumina, activated clay, transition metal oxides, heteropolyacid zeolites, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Ethanol dehydration to ethylene is an endothermic reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Natural and synthetic plastics are degradable by enzymes and microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria <ref type="bibr">[43e45]</ref>. Under different soil conditions the biodegradation proceeds differently, depending on their different properties. The most important process for initiating environmental degradation of synthetic polymers such as polylactic acid, PE, poly-(trimethylene terephthalate), and their copolymers is abiotic hydrolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. Two mechanisms, such as oxobiodegradation and hydrobiodegradation, are used for biodegradation of PE <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.2.2">BIOPROPYLENE</head><p>The production of biopropylene is technologically more challenging than that of bioethylene. The process for the preparation of biobased propylene consists of the following steps: (1) biobased synthesis of isobutanol <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, (2) dehydration to butylene, (3) isomerization to 2-butylene <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, and (4) metathesis with ethylene to propylene <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. In another method, 1,2-propanediol or acetone is first produced by fermentation, then converted to 2-propanol, and finally dehydrated to propylene <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. To produce propylene through sustainable and renewable paths, several strategies have been proposed (fermentation, gasification, and cracking of biomass), which are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 13</ref>.2 <ref type="bibr">[42,53e62]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.2.3">BIOISOBUTYLENE</head><p>Biological and chemical catalyses play important roles in the synthesis of isobutylene. Biobased isobutanol ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 13.3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> is dehydrated by using solid acids or heterogeneous catalyst to isobutylene. Another nonfermentation method for the production of isobutanol is metabolizing glucose and 2-keto-acid decarboxylase by engineered Escherichia coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.2.4">BIOISOPRENE</head><p>Methods for obtaining isoprene (C ) from renewable materials have been used in synthetic rubber manufacturing, e.g., pyrolysis of natural rubber (1860), turpentine (1884), and DL-limonene (1911) to get isoprene in low yields <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. In 1911, Staudinger had optimized the transformation of DL-limonene to isoprene by exploiting an electrically inflamed coil of wire recognized as an isoprene lamp to attain isoprene in 67% yield. Currently, Goodyear and Genencor developed a fermentation process for isoprene production. In the bioisoprene approach, fermentation of sugars, for example glucose, or other biomass takes place with engineered bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. This approach gives gaseous isoprene, which is purified and recovered for polymerization <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. The manufacture of bioisoprene includes the metabolism of glucose with recombinant E. coli via two feasible routes ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 13.5</ref>). Both mevalonate (MVA) and 5-methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways transfer the isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) to 1,1-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). During the production of bioisoprene, the alkenes isomerization of IPP to DMAPP is parallel to the natural rubber (NR) biosynthesis. Unlike NR biosynthesis, which involves propagation of additional IPP units, plant-based isoprene synthase converts the DMAPP to isoprene <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. The assessment of natural rubber trees and bioisoprene procedures recommended that this fermentation method gives a significant amount of isoprene. For example, the annual production of natural rubber from clones of Hevea trees might be as high as 2500 kg/ha <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. The polymerization of bioisoprene in hexane through heterogeneous TiCl 4 /(iso-butyl) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Al gave a high cis-1,4 content (98.5%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Glass transition temperatures and viscosity values <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> of biobased polyisoprene are very similar to those of petroleum-based polymers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.2.5">BIOBUTADIENE</head><p>Traditionally, butadiene has been obtained from bioethanol by using different heterogeneous catalysts <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, for example, catalysts based on tantala/silica <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>, alumina/ZnO <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>, and MgO/silica <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Currently, trimetallic (Cu:Zr:Zn) and bimetallic (Zr:Zn) catalysts based on silica generate up to 67% 1,3-butadiene and also give acetone and ethylene as residues <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. In the multistep process, first oxidation Thermal isomerization of b-pinene and subsequent intramolecular metathesis for the synthesis of isobutylene and an isoprene substitute <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>.</p><p>of ethanol to acetaldehyde takes place followed by an aldol reaction, which gives acetaldol. After that, a four-carbon molecule undergoes dehydration reactions, giving 1,3-butadiene. Because fermentation methods produce butadiene and bioethanol, these can be regarded as renewable monomers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.3">FATTY ACIDSeBASED POLYOLEFINS</head><p>Renewable feedstocks are exploited commonly because of the increasing awareness about the greenhouse effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, which is normally caused by the use of fossil fuels. Utilization of biomass for fuels, chemicals, and energy is basically carbon neutral. The amount of CO 2 released during the alteration of biomass by pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion, combustion, and fermentation represents the fixed amount in it. Mostly, olefins are synthesized by the steam cracking process. They may also be synthesized from natural or biogas through methanol [79e81] and oxidative coupling process <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. Coal-[84e86] and biomass-based processes [87e92] have also been described. Traditional methods used the lowest energy, whereas coal and biomassbased processes used about 60%e150% higher energy and methane-based processes used 30% higher energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. Other procedures for manufacturing biobased olefins, such as fluidized catalytic cracking of vegetable oils, have been reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. The use of biobased hydrocarbons to supplement petroleum-based feeds to existing steam crackers thus seems the most viable near-term approach to the transition of the commodity organic chemicals industry from petroleum toward renewable feeds, with little or no capital costs to olefin producers. The bio-synfining method provides possibilities for synthesizing hydrocarbon feeds for traditional steam crackers. The patent-pending method [95e97] is illustrated schematically in <ref type="figure">Fig. 13</ref>.6. In this method, fatty acids, algae, or vegetable oils are converted into paraffinic hydrocarbon fractions having no residual oxygenates <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>.</p><p>The first reaction is the most important reaction during biooil hydrotreating known as hydrodeoxygenation. Initially the fatty acid chains are hydrogenated and deoxygenated into straight-chain paraffins. Propane and n-paraffins are generated as fatty acids connected to a glycerol backbone. In the next step, the extended straight-chain paraffins are converted into smaller branched and straight isoparaffins in the presence of water, and the product consists of a wide distribution of mostly C 3 eC 18 hydrocarbons, the C 4 eC 10 hydrocarbons being renewable naphtha. The latter can be impressively converted into the preferred light olefins in a steam cracker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.4">VEGETABLE OILeBASED POLYOLEFINS</head><p>Industrial and academic research have paid attention on vegetable oils as a platform for polymeric materials owing to their intrinsic biodegradability, low price, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">FIGURE 13.6</formula><p>Schematic representation of the Bio-Synfining process <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>.</p><p>universal availability [99e112]. Polyolefins, for example, PP and PE, have been utilized in surgery since the 1950s because of good biocompatibility, high chemical stability, and favorable mechanical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>. Vegetable oilebased polyolefins are synthesized by different synthetic means owing to the existence of double bonds in the fatty acid chains. In the presence of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate, soybean oil is cationically polymerized in a supercritical dioxide medium and has potential applications as medical lubricants <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>. Some less-poisonous metal compounds such as Ni(carboxylate) 2 are highly essential for the polymerization of vegetable oils to fabricate biobased resins appropriate for printing inks as a binder <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>. Acyclic diene metathesis polymerization of double bonds present in unsaturated fatty acid derivatives is a well-organized process to produce high-molecular-weight polymers from vegetable oils <ref type="figure">(Fig. 13.7A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>. It has been shown that ethenolysis of the major fatty acid esters from meadow foam oil produced a number of polymerizable compounds <ref type="figure">(Fig. 13</ref>.7B) <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>. Likewise, thermosets can be produced from norbornene-functionalized castor oil or linseed oil by using the distinctive ringopening metathesis polymerization method <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>. Heavy metal catalysts such as tungsten and ruthenium are used in both these metathesis polymerization methods and provide highly specific new materials that would otherwise be complicated to produce by using common radical polymerization. The common process to integrate the vegetable oils into a polymeric backbone is the copolymerization of vegetable . Through the epoxy ring-opening process, the carboxyl group of acrylic acid can react with the epoxy group of epoxidized vegetable oils ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 13.8A</ref>) and generate a hydroxyl group instead of an ester group. Moreover, self-polymerization of epoxy groups also takes place during this epoxy ring-opening process <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>. Glass transition temperatures of vegetable oilebased polymers are comparatively low; thus copolymerization with styrene can be utilized to increase the transition temperature up to 90 C <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>.</p><p>The glass transition temperature can also be increased by increasing the double bond functionality and, so increase the cross-linking density. For instance, reactive double bonds might be added by reacting the hydroxyl group produced in the epoxy ring-opening method with maleic anhydride (MA). Polymers synthesized by this process have high glass transition temperatures and good mechanical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>. In 2013, a new class of acrylate-functional monomers/oligomers was obtained from epoxidized soy methyl ester and epoxidized soybean oil by exploiting 2hydroxyethyl acrylate as an acrylating agent ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 13.8B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>. It was found that the acrylic functional products synthesized through this method have high acrylic contents and low viscosity. Olefin metathesis offers a well-established method to synthesize terminal olefins. Transition metals are usually used as catalysts. Ethylene generally reacted with unsaturated fatty acid esters to form terminal olefins and to cleave their double bonds. Oleic acid methyl ester can react with ethylene via metathesis and generate 1decene and 9-decenoic acid methyl ester. Terminal olefins of different molecular weights can be produced by using different kinds of fatty acids having double bonds in diverse locations on their alkane chains. These terminal olefins might be copolymerized by other polymerizable olefins to enhance the properties and directly polymerized to produce brushlike polyolefin <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>.</p><p>Addition of highly reactive double bonds by using the carboxyl is a simple method to produce fatty acidebased polymerizable monomers. Oleyloxyethyl methacrylate can be synthesized by reacting 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate with oleoyl chloride and has potential applications in bone cement formulations <ref type="figure">(Fig. 13.9A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>. Similarly, structural monomers can be produced by reacting fatty acids with glycidyl methacrylate <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref>. Chains of the fatty acids greatly affect the polymer properties. Increasing the chain length can increase the polymer viscosity, whereas double bonds can decrease the viscosity.</p><p>These monomers can also be produced by the lipase-catalyzed green method. The 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate reacts with methyl oleate to generate oleyloxyethyl methacrylate in the presence of Novozym 435 lipase as catalyst <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>. This enzymatic reaction is carried out at about 50 C, and the catalyst simply removed by filtration. Moreover, oleic acidebased epoxy monomers can be produced by reacting 2-hydroxylethyl acrylate and epoxy stearic acid <ref type="figure">(Fig. 13.9B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref>. The double bonds of the fatty acid are converted into an epoxy, and the polymer becomes more oxidatively stable and therefore further cross-linked by epoxy groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>.

Furthermore, the uses of ionic liquids are very attractive because they can dissolve many organic and inorganic (liquids/solids) compounds such as polymers and biopolymers [154e157]. Ionic liquids are thermally stable, chemically inert, biocompatible, nonvolatilizable, and noncombustible; can be modified according to the needs; and are also a very promising replacement for the traditional toxic volatile organic solvent [158e161]. Choline chloride/glycerol (ChCl/Gly) is a eutectic-based ionic liquid, which is biocompatible, environmental friendly, and inexpensive and also has a very low freezing point (À40 C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>. Shamsuri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref> combined ChCl/Gly and a cationic surfactant (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) to increase the compatibility between agar and HDPE ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 13.10)</ref>.</p><p>Surfactants are amphiphilic compounds that have both nonpolar and polar parts (hydrophobic and hydrophilic alkyl groups, HTAB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">165]</ref> and stimulate the polymer composite components to cooperate with each other <ref type="bibr">[166e168]</ref>. They also improved the compatibility of the biocomposites. In addition, ionic liquid is also used to solvate the surfactant <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref> and to help the HTAB to react with both agar and HDPE in the biocomposites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.5.2">CALCIUM ALGINATE/LINEAR LDPE BIOCOMPOSITES</head><p>Environmental polices of developed countries are increasing the pressure on manufacturers to consider the environmental impact of their products. Therefore, natural fibers are used as a reinforcement of polymer-based composites because of their renewable sources. They are also used as reinforcement in automotive industry. Natural fibers have many advantages, such as low density, low cost, biodegradability, and high specific properties, compared with conventional ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref>. Natural fiber composites have high durability and stability against insects and fungi compared with wood. Furthermore, they have high thermal and mechanical properties compared with synthetic fibers. A combination of natural fibers and polymers noticeably increased the stiffness and strength of the resulting materials even at low fiber content. Nevertheless, owing to the poor fiber/matrix compatibility, the interfacial adhesion is not adequate, which decreased the mechanical properties. Therefore, a compatibilizing agent is needed. Many compatibilizing techniques are used, especially in the case of MA-grafted polymers for reactive blending with the fibers and polymers.</p><p>The development of the interfacial adhesion clearly enhanced the mechanical properties of the composites [171e176]. The combination of natural fibers and biodegradable polymers give degradable and environment-friendly composites. Natural fiber thermoplastic composite is comparatively a new group of composite materials in which natural fibers/fillers, for example, jute fiber, kenaf fiber, wood fiber, and sisal, are combined with a thermoplastic, such as PP, PE, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinyl chloride, to construct the composite. Owing to the improvement in the processing equipment and new production techniques, natural fiber thermoplastic composites are becoming very attractive and used in residential, building, and automotive applications.</p><p>Alginate is a polymeric acid obtained from brown seaweeds. It consists of linear copolymers a-(1-4)-linked L-guluronic acid (G) and b-(1-4)-linked D-mannuronic acid (M) <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref> and has the properties of both G and M units. The contents of MM, GG, and GM segments are considerably different for alginate obtained from different types of seaweeds. Alginate gives salts with monovalent metal ions, for example, potassium and sodium give water-soluble salts [178e183]. Most divalent ions, for example, zinc and calcium, give water-insoluble alginate salts. Alginate fibers might be synthesized by squeezing out the solutions of sodium alginate into a bath of calcium ions. Compositing is a valuable process to improve the physicochemical performance of polymeric materials.</p><p>Thus polymer composites are extensively used in both industrial and scientific applications. LLDPE was utilized as a matrix and calcium alginate fiber was utilized as the reinforcing material to synthesize a reinforced composite. LLDPE has shorter chain branching and low molecular weight distribution; therefore, it is less shear sensitive. During a shearing method, such as extrusion, LLDPE remains viscous and is thus difficult to process. During extrusion, the lesser shear sensitivity of LLDPE gives quicker stress relaxation of the polymer chains and thus the physical properties changed the blow-up ratios. During melt extension, LLDPE has lower viscosity at all strain rates. Owing to the short chain branching, LLDPE permits the chains to "slide by" one another upon elongation without becoming entangled.</p><p>This property is essential for film applications because LLDPE films might be downgauged smoothly while retaining high toughness and strength. The rheological properties of LLDPE can be summed up as "stiff in shear" and "soft in extension." They can be recycled into other things such as landscaping ties, trash can liners, lumber, compost bins, shipping envelopes, and floor tiles. The quality of the interface is important for fiber-reinforced polymer composites, as they manage the mechanical performance of the resulting composites <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">182]</ref>. The single fiber fragmentation test (SFFT) is used to measure the interfacial properties of fiberreinforced composites. Convenient monitoring of failure processes directly, replication of the stress transfer properties in real composites, and simple specimen handling are the advantages of the SFFT process. It is an important process to determine the interfacial properties of the fiber-reinforced polymer composites [184e187]. Degradation tests of composites showed that they lose their mechanical properties about 30% and, therefore, show biodegradability.</p></div>

Biomolecules such as enzymes and protein antibodies are frequently utilized to develop biological substitutes for the therapeutic replacement and tremendous need for organs and tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[188]</ref>. But these biomolecules are unstable and expensive, and their affinity decreases significantly under artificial conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[189,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">190]</ref>. In the molecular imprinting method, synthetic recognition sites are able to memorize the chemical properties and shape of the target molecules. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) have distinctive properties, for example, easy preparation, low cost, and high stability, in comparison with the affinity matrices synthesized by using enzymes or antibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[191]</ref>. The MIPs have been utilized in a variety of applications, such as separations <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[192]</ref>, catalysis, solid-phase extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[193]</ref>, biomimetic sensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">[194]</ref>, and drug delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">[195]</ref>. Pan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[196]</ref> employed a molecular imprinting method to establish the cell-adhesive peptide RGDS onto a thermoresponsive cell culture substrate, and used to produce cell sheets. Fukazawa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[197]</ref> recommended a novel molecular imprinting method by using the cell-adhesive protein fibronectin (FN) as the template for cell capturing. The interaction between FN and fetal calf serum was attained on the FN imprinting substrate, which increased the cell adhesion. The imprinting of low-molecular-weight compounds has been well recognized. In the imprinting of proteins, there are many conflicts owing to the structural complexity, large size, and elastic conformation of the biomacromolecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[198]</ref>. Polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogels have been used for protein imprinting <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[199]</ref>. But because of the poor regeneration and poor mechanical properties of the surface, their applications are limited. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)-imprinted PP fiber-grafted PAM hydrogel was developed, in which acrylamide was used as a functional monomer, BSA as a template molecule, and nonwoven PP fiber as a matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[200]</ref>. BSA-imprinted calcium alginate/PAM hydrogel film was developed in which BSA act as a template and sodium alginate and acrylamide act as functional monomers to increase the strength of the PAM hydrogel. Acetic acid solution and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were employed to eliminate BSA. But it is difficult to totally eliminate the SDS, and the remaining SDS can cause cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">[201]</ref>. FN-imprinted PP nonwoven holding calcium alginate/polyacrylamide hydrogel films (PP-s-CA/PAM MIP) were produced by using nonwoven PP fiber as matrix through ultraviolet radiation-reduced polymerization. The PP-s-CA/PAM MIP has a high adsorption capability for FN compared with nonimprinted polymer (NIP) and is utilized for the culture of mouse fibroblast cells (L929). Results suggested that PP-s-CA/PAM MIP has improved cell adherence property in comparison with NIP and is widely used in tissue engineering and cell culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[202]</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Fig. 13.11</ref>).</p></div>

SW is a pure natural material that has many properties such as excellent heat capacity, heat insulation, strong carbon dioxide fixation, and biodegradability. Owing to fibrils, it also has energy-absorbing properties, which increased the sound-absorption and insulation properties. In addition, it also functions as an excellent flame retardant <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[204]</ref>. In spite of these properties, SW obtained from chemical reactions has many dumping problems. Therefore, SW was used as reinforcing material for biocomposites because it is a favorable material. It is divided into three main classes of red algae, brown algae, and green algae. Lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, ash, nitrogen, and fibers are the most important chemical components of SW. For the structural constituent of cell walls, SW also consists of crystalline cellulose <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">[205,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">206]</ref>. SW has been successfully studied as reinforcement in biocomposites, for example, red algae fiber/PBS <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[207,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">208]</ref>, SW/PP [209e211], and SW residues/HDPE composites <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">[212]</ref>.

In contrast, biomedicine and bioengineering application using HDPE filled with marine residues particularly seaweed residues (SR) is limited. Nevertheless, research on the direct applications of hydroxyapatite and corals and implantation in persons and animals has been developed [213e216]. Guillemin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[217,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b217">218]</ref> studied various types of coralline structures as boneembedded substitutes. Bone-embedded substitutes were absorbed and gradually replaced by growing bone, showing that corals are osteoconductive materials that act as a straight platform for osteoblast. Mora and Ouhayoun <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">[219]</ref> carried out histological studies of hydroxyapatite and coral implants in bone damage and found outstanding outcome when implants were studied after 12 months. Papacharalambous and Anastasoff <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">[220]</ref> also studied four different coral genders, such as Porites, Acropora, Pocillopora, and Fungia, and exploited them to enhance the facial factions in three patients (younger than 30 years).

Catano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">[221]</ref> examined the effect of gamma rays on thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties of HDPE filled with SR and recommended that high-filler-content composite is the most excellent selection for industrial and biomedical applications.</p></div>

SW/PP biocomposites were prepared using different amounts of SW. GA/PP biocomposites have superior impact strength and thermal stability compared with BA/PP biocomposites. The pretreatment of GA with sulfuric acid results in excellent thermal stability, whereas sulfuric acidetreated GA/PP biocomposites have better mechanical and thermal properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.7">CHLORELLAePOLYETHYLENE BIOCOMPOSITE</head><p>Biological fixation of CO 2 by using photosynthetic microalga such as Chlorella is an excellent process to decrease CO in the atmosphere due to the high consumption rate (10%e20%) of light energy with Chlorella than common plants (0.1% e0.5%). For such fixation process, efficient utilization of the microalgae is important after fixation of CO 2 . So, ChlorellaePE composite is used in building materials. Owing to the poor affinity of Chlorella for PE, it is necessary to modify Chlorella with PE. This modified PE can effectively interact with Chlorella by chemical bonds. It has been reported that MA is a valuable modifier for PP and PE <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">[223]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="13.8">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES</head><p>Biobased polyolefins derived from intermediates obtained from renewable resources are gaining much attention. Biobased ethylene can be produced by endothermic dehydration of bioethanol by using different catalysts. Several strategies are involved to produce biopropylene through sustainable and renewable paths such as fermentation, gasification, and cracking of biomass. Isobutanol produced by A proposed reaction mechanism for the formation of chemical bonds between chlorella grains and an MPE matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b225">[225]</ref>.</p><p>fermentative or nonfermentative method is dehydrated by using solid acids or heterogeneous catalyst to bioisobutylene. Isomerization-metathesis of b-pinene is another method for bioisobutylene production. Bioisoprene can be prepared from glucose using the MVA or MEP routes. Bioderived butadiene is synthesized from bioethanol by using different heterogeneous catalysts and trimetallic and bimetallic catalysts supported on silica. Properties of biobased polyolefins are very similar to petroleum-based polyolefins. In the bio-synfining method, fatty acids, algae, or vegetable oils are converted into paraffinic hydrocarbon fractions having no residual oxygenate. Vegetable oilebased polyolefins are synthesized by different synthetic means owing to the existence of double bonds in the fatty acid chains. The fabrication cost of the composites can be reduced by using natural fibers as fillers; therefore, polymer biocomposites have received great attention. Natural fibers have many advantages such as low density, low cost, biodegradability, and high specific properties compared with conventional ones. Natural fiber composites have high durability and stability against insects and fungi compared with wood. Furthermore, they have better thermal and mechanical properties compared with synthetic fibers. Biocomposites produced using PE as a matrix may have great importance because this polymer shows chemical resistance, nontoxicity, and biocompatibility. HDPE/ agar biocomposites are utilized to produce biodegradable and biocompatible products. ChCl/Gly and HTAB can be used to increase the compatibility between agar and HDPE. Calcium alginate/linear LDPE biocomposites lose their mechanical properties about 30% and show biodegradable behavior. FN-imprinted PP nonwoven holding calcium alginate/PAM hydrogel films are widely used in tissue engineering and cell culture. HDPE/SR composite is appropriate for bone replacement material. Chlorella-MA-modified PE composites have tensile strength about two times greater than that of composites resulting from unmodified PE.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Fig. 13.1 shows the synthesis of bioethylene from bioethanol by using zeolites (HZSM-5) or mesoporous silica (Ni-MCM-41) as catalysts [40e42].</figDesc></figure>

These single-celled algae, commonly referred to as zooxanthellae and predominantly belonging to the genus Symbiodinium <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>), establish relationships with numerous hosts, including representatives of the Protists, Porifera, Cnidaria and Mollusca <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Glynn 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lobban et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rowan 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trench 1993)</ref>. In most cases the algae are intracellular, residing in complex host-derived vacuoles <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Colley and Trench 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wakefield and Kempf 2001)</ref>, but some invertebrates (e.g., bivalves in the genera Hippopus and Tridacna) harbor their symbionts intercellularly in an elaborate tubular system <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Norton et al. 1992)</ref>. Given the oligotrophic nature of waters surrounding coral reefs, it comes as no surprise that the basis of the symbiosis is nutritional, with the dinoflagellates playing a significant role in host nourishment and physiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Muscatine and Porter 1977)</ref>. For example, photosynthetically fixed carbon, typically in the form of glycerol and other simple molecules, can be translocated from the algae at a rate and volume capable of meeting the hosts' respiratory demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Falkowski et al. 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Muscatine 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Muscatine et al. 1984)</ref>. Furthermore, the presence of Symbiodinium facilitates the assimilation and conservation of nitrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ambariyanto and Hoegh-Guldberg 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burris 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lewis and Smith 1971)</ref>, a limiting resource in these ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Muller-Parker and D'Elia 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Muscatine and Porter 1977)</ref>. For the scleractinian corals, whose skeletons comprise the physical structure of reefs, the presence of algal symbionts also significantly enhances calcification rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barnes and Chalker 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Pearse and Muscatine 1971)</ref>.</p><p>While vertical (''closed'' system) transmission, in which Symbiodinium is passed directly from parent to progeny, is common, a vast majority of invertebrates (85%; <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Schwarz et al. 2002)</ref> produce offspring that must be infected from environmental pools of Symbiodinium <ref type="bibr">(horizontal, or ''open'' system, transmission)</ref>. Given the more-or-less obligate nature of Symbiodinium -invertebrate symbioses (exceptions do exist; for example, some anemones, such as Aiptasia sp., can prosper without their symbionts when alternative sources of nutrition are available), it is surprising that horizontal transmission of algae to each new host generation is so prevalent. However, horizontal transmission potentially offers host progeny an opportunity to associate with Symbiodinium better adapted to local environmental conditions <ref type="bibr">(van Oppen 2004)</ref>. This hypothesis assumes functional and, by extension, genetic diversity exists within the genus Symbiodinium. But until the advent of culturing techniques, electron microscopy and molecular analyses, there was scant evidence supporting this assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Historical Prospective on Symbiodinium Diversity</head><p>In marine environments, intimate relationships (i.e., endosymbioses) between unicellular algae and invertebrates have been recognized since the 19th century. <ref type="bibr">Brandt (1881)</ref> coined the term ''zooxanthellae'' to classify the yellow-brown algae associated with animal cells. Subsequent work by Klebs (1884), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Brandt (1885)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Chatton (1923)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hovasse (1924)</ref> proposed the inclusion of these algae in the Dinoflagellata, a group of single-cell protists common to aquatic environments. Support for this idea came from the successful culturing of algae from a cnidarian host (Kawaguti 1944). Kawaguti's observation of motile ''swarmers'', possessing the characteristic morphology of gymnodinoid dinoflagellates, along with similar reports by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">McLaughlin and Zahl (1959)</ref>, proved unequivocally the dinoflagellate identity of these algae. <ref type="bibr">Freudenthal (1962)</ref> formally described the taxonomy, life cycle and morphology of these dinoflagellates and erected the genus Symbiodinium to encompass the symbiotic dinoflagellates associated with a phylogenetically diverse range of invertebrate hosts (see above).</p><p>Until the 1970s, all symbiotic dinoflagellates were considered members of a single pandemic species, Symbiodinium microadriaticum Freudenthal <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Taylor 1974)</ref>. Experimental evidence, however, including behavioral, infectivity, physiological and ultrastructural, subsequently challenged that view <ref type="bibr">(Schoenberg and Trench 1980a-c)</ref>. Molecular genetic studies, in particular, have revealed a tremendous level of diversity within the genus Symbiodinium (reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baker 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse 2001 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Santos et al. 2001)</ref>. Below, we focus on the genetic diversity of Symbiodinium, examine the distribution of this diversity over time and space, speculate as to its source and discuss future directions for research on these organisms. For consistency, we use the term ''type(s)'' to represent a member of the genus Symbiodinium, which possesses a unique genetic sequence at any particular locus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Levels of Diversity within Symbiodinium</head><p>Over the last two decades, the analysis of various molecules has been used to elucidate genetic diversity within Symbiodinium. This diversity is evident not only at highly variable loci such as microsatellites, but also at more conserved molecules. The first molecular genetic studies of Symbiodinium utilized DNA/ DNA hybridization and allozymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Blank and Huss 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Schoenberg and Trench 1980a)</ref>. In the hybridization studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Blank and Huss 1989)</ref>, the degree of binding among DNAs from some Symbiodinium isolates differed as much as DNA from algae in different classes. This diversity was placed in an evolutionary context using sequences derived from nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S-rDNA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rowan and Powers 1991a)</ref>. As before, the sequence variation of the examined Symbiodinium isolates was unexpectedly high and comparable to that of orders of free-living dinoflagellates <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rowan and Powers 1992)</ref>. This discovery led to the development and adoption of a classification scheme for Symbiodinium that divides the genus into one of several large groups, or clades (i.e. Symbiodinium clades A, B, C <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[Rowan and Powers 1991a]</ref>, D <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Carlos et al. 1999]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[Pochon et al. 2001]</ref> and the newly erected H <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[Pochon et al. 2004]</ref>). Within this context, Symbiodinium belonging to clade A clusters into one group with clade E intermediate between clade A and members of the other clades (B/C/D/F/G/H), which form a second, closely related complex <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. Among these clades, D/G are basal to B/C/F/H, clades C and H are sister clades, and are closely related to clade F. Phylogenies inferred from chloroplast <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Santos et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Takashita et al. 2003</ref>) and mitochondrial <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Takabayashi et al. 2004)</ref> genes have provided additional support for these relationships. Within any given clade, additional genetic diversity has been identified (see below), supporting the idea that each clade is comprised of multiple strains or ''species'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Rowan 1998)</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1</ref>). The within-, or intra-, cladal diversity of Symbiodinium has primarily been explored using gene sequences of the ribosomal operon (18S, 5.8S and 28S rDNA). Although an appreciable level of variation has been identified with these molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baillie et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Barneah et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Belda-Baillie et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Burnett 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Carlos et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Darius et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">Darius et al. , 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">Karako-Lampert et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lee et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Loh et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">McNally et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilcox 1998)</ref>, the less-conserved ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions have recently seen widespread use in quantifying Symbiodinium diversity within the clades <ref type="bibr">(Diekmann et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse , 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Santos et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Oppen et al. 2001)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hunter et al. (1997)</ref> first showed, by using the entire region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2), the value of ITS in distinguishing among Symbiodinium isolates. LaJeunesse (2001) used sequence variation within the ITS to resolve 6, 4, 2 and 2 groups within clades A, B, C and F, respectively. Within these groups, up to 22 sequence differences have been observed between some clade B isolates and as many as 76 sequence differences can occur among clade A samples (LaJeunesse 2001). Although sequence and length variability of ITS makes it difficult to align this region between the clades, thus limiting its use to within-clade phylogenetics, <ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse (2002)</ref> determined that the ITS2 region alone provided resolution of many ''types'' within Symbiodinium. To rapidly assess this variation and to examine how it is distributed among host taxa and geographic location, disparities in electrophoretic mobility due to differences in the primary sequence of ITS2 (i.e. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis <ref type="bibr">[DGGE]</ref>) have been utilized (see below). This approach has allowed sampling of Symbiodinium populations from a diverse array of hosts over many regional scales. Such surveys have uncovered over 23 and 35 ''types'' in cnidarians from Australia and the Caribbean, respectively <ref type="bibr">(LaJeunesse et al. 2003)</ref>, and extrapolation of these values suggest that 100s of Symbiodinium ''types'', as defined by ITS2 sequences, potentially exist in the world's oceans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Host-Symbiodinium Relationships: Specificity vs. Flexibility</head><p>Our current understanding of diversity within Symbiodinium and their association with host taxa reveals a complex set of interactions suggesting varying degrees of host-symbiont specificity among partnerships. A basic question is how Symbiodinium diversity is distributed among host phyla (cnidarian, mollusk, foraminifera, etc.) and among species. A survey of host-symbiont pairings shows that symbiont types are not randomly distributed among hosts: i.e., members of the same host species generally harbor the same Symbiodinium taxa or species <ref type="bibr">Rowan and Powers 1991a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schoenberg and Trench 1980a, b, c</ref>; but see exceptions below). Sampling multiple host taxa of a single reef, LaJeunesse (2002) identified 69 ''types'' with the majority of host species associating with a single symbiont ''type''. Although specific Symbiodinium ''types'' associate with particular host species in nearly all instances, the algae naturally found within a given host are a subset of the taxa that can actually infect that host <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Coffroth et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Colley and Trench 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> ARTICLE IN PRESS <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The phylogenetic relationships between the major clades of Symbiodinium. The topology is a consensus cladogram synthesized from <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Pochon et al. (2004)</ref> and other references cited in this review. The positioning of Symbiodinium clades B, C, F and H varies depending on the method of tree generation and the molecules analyzed. All the clades shown except clades E and H have been identified within scleractinian corals, with clades A, B, C and D being the predominant symbionts within scleractinians. Clade B is the dominant clade within the Caribbean octocorals, while clades A and C are also common in Red Sea and Pacific octocorals, respectively. Clade E has been found in a sea anemone while clades F, G and H are common in foraminifera. We have noted cases of synonymous nomenclature in the literature and indicated the accepted nomenclature and references. a Tentatively identified as Entacmaea quadricolor (D. Fautin, University of Kansas, pers. comm.). b See discussion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baker (2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Fitt 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kinzie 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kinzie and Chee 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Santos et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schoenberg and Trench 1980a, c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Schwarz et al. 1999 and</ref><ref type="bibr">reviewed in Baker 2003)</ref>. The fact that the subset of the Symbiodinium taxa that a host species may harbor can vary in different habitats suggests an interaction between specificity and local environments <ref type="bibr">(LaJeunesse and Trench 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Rodriguez-Lanetty et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rowan and Knowlton 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rowan et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Secord 1995)</ref>. In many cases, external environmental conditions promote certain pairings between partners. These include combinations that change with regard to depth, irradiance or temperature gradients, latitude and longitude and host ontogeny. We now turn our attention to the host-symbiont specificity and environmental flexibility that is observed within this group of dinoflagellates in order to examine how Symbiodinium genetic diversity is distributed among host phyla.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specificity in Host-Symbiodinium pairings</head><p>Specificity in host-Symbiodinium pairings is well documented. Isozyme and morphological studies first suggested that the same symbiont was found within a host across broad geographic ranges while symbionts differed between host species <ref type="bibr">(Schoenberg and Trench 1980a, b, c)</ref>. That conclusion was confirmed with molecular genetic data. In many cases, a Symbiodinium ''type'' associates with only one or a few host species. In other instances, one of the two partners is more flexible so that some host species associate with a number of symbiont ''types'' and some symbionts ''types'' are found within a range of hosts (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baker 2003</ref> On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), ''types'' C1, C3 and C21 (based on ITS2) are common among a wide range of hosts, but LaJeunesse and co-workers (2003) found many host-specific symbiont ''types'' as well. For example, ''type'' C17 was found only in Montipora spp., C22a in Turbinaria spp., C8a in Stylophora pistillata at 10 m and C27 in Pavona varians at 10 m. Host-symbiont specificities are also seen among phyla; foraminifera harbor mainly Symbiodinium ''types'' within clade F <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pochon et al. 2001)</ref> and clade B ''type'' B1/B184 appears to be specific to cnidarians <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Rodriguez-Lanetty 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The life stage at which symbiont specificity is manifested varies among host taxa. As noted above, within cnidarians, Symbiodinium are acquired in early development either by direct transmission from the mother to her offspring (vertical or closed) or anew each generation from the environment (horizontal or open). How the specific symbiosis is re-established in the latter case is still an active area of research. Within Caribbean octocorals, initial symbiont acquisition is promiscuous and non-selective, with host polyps taking up multiple symbiont clades (i.e., clades A, B and/or C). The specificity seen in the adult host is then established as the newly settled polyp develops <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Coffroth et al. 2001)</ref>. In contrast, studies of scleractinians with horizontal transmission of symbionts have revealed a different scenario. Newly settled Acropora polyps appear to be more selective, only taking up ''types'' belonging to clades C or D (Little et al. 2004), although other clades are less prevalent on these reefs <ref type="bibr">(LaJeunesse et al. 2004a)</ref>. Larvae of the solitary coral Fungia exhibit a preference for the symbiont ''type'' of the adult <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Rodriguez-Lanetty et al. 2004)</ref>. Furthermore, at least in some host species, the mode of transmission appears to be correlated with the symbiont type. In the Red Sea (Gulf of Eilat), scleractinians and alcyonaceans with direct transmission generally harbor clade A ''types'' while those with horizontal transmission tend to harbor clade C symbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Barneah et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Karako-Lampert et al. 2004)</ref>. This trend has not been observed in other regions where hosts contain algae within clades B, C or D despite having direct transmission of symbionts. Finally, similar levels of symbiont diversity are found within acroporids that have vertical (Montipora spp.) or horizontal (Acropora spp.) transmission of symbionts, suggesting that mode of symbiont transmission does not affect the levels of symbiont diversity within some host species (van Oppen 2004). However, LaJeunesse and co-workers (2004a, b) contend that vertical transmission selects for host-symbiont specificity, leading to symbiont diversity and thus a greater overall Symbiodinium diversity on the reef.</p><p>Although coevolution can be an outcome of, and a driving force in, the evolution of specificity in a symbiosis, it has not been substantiated among host-Symbiodinium systems <ref type="bibr">(LaJeunesse 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Langer and Lipps 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rowan and Powers 1991a;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Oppen et al. 2001)</ref>. Genetic markers that can address this question at a finer level of resolution than has been used in the past are now becoming available (e.g., microsatellites and their flanking regions) and evidence in support of it may be forthcoming. If and when coevolution is documented, it will greatly advance our understanding of why particular ''types'' of Symbiodinium are distributed among host taxa as well as identifying one of the forces underlying the generating of Symbiodinium diversity over evolutionary time (but see below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flexibility in Host-Symbiodinium Pairings</head><p>Numerous host-Symbiodinium pairings are conserved over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Goulet and Coffroth 2003b</ref>) and space <ref type="bibr">(Diekmann et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse 2002</ref>), suggesting the existence of specific host-symbiont recognition systems. However, in some cases, the pairings may vary in response to the environment of the holobiont. The two most common environmental parameters that correlate with the distribution of specific host-Symbiodinium pairings are irradiance and temperature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rowan and Knowlton (1995)</ref> found variation in the symbionts associated with Caribbean Montastraea species over a depth/irradiance gradient. Clade A and B symbionts were found in shallow waters (less than 6 m) while clade C symbionts were restricted to deeper depths. In a study of Symbiodinium diversity within scleractinians on the <ref type="bibr">GBR, LaJeunesse et al. (2003)</ref> identified 9 host species where the symbiont type varied between deep (10 m) and shallow (o3 m) sites, including Stylophora pistillata, which at depths of less than 3 m harbored C1, while those colonies collected at 10 m harbored C27. In fact, Symbiodinium genetic identity may influence the vertical distribution of a host species, as illustrated by Pocillopora verrucosa and Pavona gigantea on eastern Pacific reefs. In this case, shallow (0-6 m) reef communities are dominated by P. verrucosa while P. gigantea dominates at deeper (6-14 m) depths. Symbiodinium of ''type'' D1 (based on ITS2) is exclusive to P. verrucosa while C1c occurs in P. gigantea <ref type="bibr">(Iglesias-Prieto et al. 2004)</ref>, suggesting that symbiont identity plays a role in this distribution. The results of photosynthetic measurements and transplant experiments supported this hypothesis, with P. verrucosa D1 and P. gigantea C1c exhibiting ''sun-loving'' and ''shade-adapted'' qualities, respectively (Iglesias- <ref type="bibr">Prieto et al. 2004)</ref>. Other studies examining the distribution of symbionts along the surface of a single host colony corroborate the idea that symbiont distribution can respond to changes in irradiance levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rowan et al. 1997)</ref>. Within single colonies of Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata, clades A and B symbionts resided in areas of the host that were under highest irradiance while clade C occurred in shaded areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rowan et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">). van Oppen et al. (2001</ref> also observed within colony structuring of symbiont populations consistent with differential light intensity. In their study, ''type'' C2 (based on ITS1) was found in areas of Acropora tenuis exposed to the sun, while ''type'' C1 was found in the shaded portions of the same colony.</p><p>Ulstrup and van <ref type="bibr">Oppen (2003)</ref> have also reported intracolony variation in Acropora spp. In this latter study, symbiont location within an A. tenuis individual varied at some sites, while in other locations, this trend was not observed. Regional and latitudinal differences in symbiont availability as well as differential responses to environmental factors were given as a possible explanation. In addition to irradiance, temperature differences were proposed to explain the diversity in host-Symbiodinium pairings (see below).</p><p>In contrast, in a survey of 35 Caribbean octocoral species, <ref type="bibr">Goulet and Coffroth (2003a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">2004)</ref> did not find any variation among Symbiodinium clade B ''types'' within a colony or over a range of depths. In these studies, portions of colonies were transplanted to a range of environments with variable light levels and the symbiont communities were monitored over a 20-month period. This analysis examined the symbiont complement using DNA fingerprinting, a sensitive method for detecting genetic variation. Surprisingly, the symbiont populations within individual host colonies did not change during this time span <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Goulet and Coffroth 2003b)</ref>. Few studies have monitored symbiont diversity temporally over normal environmental fluctuations. In those that have, most have not detected any variation over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Goulet and Coffroth 2003b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hannes and Coffroth unpubl. data;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rodriguez-Lanetty et al. 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Flexibility in the Symbiodinium ''type'' harbored is also seen at the level of different host individuals, with variation in symbiont type observed over large, as well as small, biogeographic regions. Latitudinal variation in host -symbiont pairings has been observed for a number of host species. For example, hosts found in tropical northeastern Australian tended to harbor symbionts within clade C while host conspecifics in temperate latitudes in southeastern Australia harbored symbionts in clade B <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Rodriguez-Lanetty et al. 2001)</ref>. Similarly, <ref type="bibr">La-Jeunesse et al. (2004a)</ref> observed dramatic differences in dominance of ''type'' C3 h, with this particular symbiont being absent or rare on high latitude reefs but having high prevalence on a mid-latitude reef. The latitudinal distribution of specific host-Symbiodinium pairings such as these have been attributed to temperature and other environmental clines that occur along these transects. Variation in host -symbiont pairings has also been documented at finer genetic levels within some Symbiodinium ''types'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Santos and Coffroth 2003a)</ref>. Along a 450 km transect in the Bahamas,  sampled 575 individuals of Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae and identified unique ''types'' (based on allele size variation at two microsatellite loci) of Symbiodinium B1/ B184 in association with these colonies. Added to this, striking population structure was observed since most of these Symbiodinium clade B ''types'' were either unique to a reef or found infrequently on other reefs .</p><p>The correlation of environmental parameters with symbiont distribution suggests that physiological differences between the symbiont ''types'' may generate the variability in host -symbiont pairing. Characterizing the physiological response of the various Symbiodinium taxa to different environmental parameters is in its infancy, but it is clear that physiological variation exists and is responsible for at least some of the variation in host-symbiont pairings. Symbiodinium ''types'' vary in their physiological response to environmental changes <ref type="bibr">(Iglesias-Prieto and Trench 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kinzie et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rowan et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Warner et al. 1996)</ref> as well as their thermal tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bhagooli and Hidaka 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kinzie et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Perez et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rowan 2004)</ref>.

Besides contributing to an area of Symbiodinium research in which data are sorely lacking, the work of Tchernov and co-workers demonstrates that in the absence of explicit data, the assignment of specific physiological attributes to particular Symbiodinium taxa should be made using a measure of caution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sources of Symbiodinium Genetic Diversity</head><p>Diversity in Symbiodinium is reminiscent of an onion; as new genetic markers are utilized, a novel level of variation is discovered below those that were previously recognized <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3)</ref>. This idea is exemplified by Symbiodinium clade B found in the Caribbean. Although Symbiodinium B1/B184 represents the most prevalent symbiotic dinoflagellate in the Caribbean (La-Jeunesse 2002) and could be considered a ''generalist'', sequence variation in microsatellite flanking regions has identified at least five unique ''types'' within this group and found them associating specifically with particular hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Santos et al. 2004)</ref>. This situation raises questions regarding the processes creating this diversity and how such a high level of variation is maintained in natural populations. Below, we discuss two hypotheses proposed in the literature to explain these phenomena.</p><p>Symbiodinium phylogenies inferred from different molecules typically have a similar appearance; each of the major clades is separated from each other by a relatively long branch and is punctuated by a cluster of highly similar (and thus, closely related) sequence types. <ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse (2005)</ref> proposed that this pattern is consistent with the occurrence of Symbiodinium radiations over the last 5-6 million years. Furthermore, his interpretations suggest that corresponding genetic bottlenecks in diversity have also occurred through Understanding the diversity of zooxanthella populations has important ramifications for studying the symbiosis and understanding how the symbiosis responds to environmental changes. This figure illustrates the levels of diversity that have been identified in Symbiodinium and the methods used to quantify this diversity, using particular members of clade B (underlined in the figure) as an example. Analysis of Symbiodinium using relatively conserved molecules such as the 18S-and 28S-rDNA distinguishes the broad subgeneric groups or clades. Sequence analysis of these markers is useful in distinguishing Symbiodinium from other dinoflagellate groups and placing the taxa in a phylogenetic context (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). As noted in the text, although these clades are phylogenetically distinct, adaptive radiation has lead to much diversity within each group so that ''clade-specific'' characteristics can be identified in only a few cases (i.e., thermal/stress tolerance appears to be a trait of Clade D and C17 appears resistant to bleaching). This within-clade variation is detected using more variable molecules such as chloroplast 23S-rDNA and the ITS regions. Primers developed to study variation in these molecules can be applied across clades. These markers can be used to compare closely related symbiont taxa and have been used to examine finer scale pattern within and among host species and across biogeographic regions. Within the ITS ''types'', additional diversity is recognized through the sequence analysis of microsatellite flanking regions. These regions are variable and tend to be unique to a subset of a given ITS2 ''type''. For example, analysis of microsatellite flanking regions within symbionts harbored by the host family Gorgonicea revealed the existence of five phylotypes . Using allelic variation at these microsatellite loci, symbiont diversity at the population level was then characterized within one of these host species (Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae). Between 8 and 10 alleles per loci were detected, and when combined, corresponded to 23 unique genotypes . Other techniques, such as DNA fingerprinting, have been used to further resolve the genetic diversity at the level of the individual symbiont clones. Representative studies that used these molecules include: <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">), McNally et al. (1994</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Rowan and Powers (1991a,b)</ref>, Wilcox (1998). <ref type="bibr">2</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Santos et al.

Rapid diversification through host specialization and allopatric differentiation proceeds following episodic radiations of a few opportunistic (generalist) ''types''. Repeated iterations of this process eventually give rise to the numerous ''types'' with the distinct host, geographic and environmental attributes identified today <ref type="bibr">(LaJeunesse 2005)</ref>. Interestingly, based on biogeographic and paleotological evidence (i.e. molecular clock estimates), it appears that the progenitors of the Symbiodinium clade C radiation spread to numerous host taxa in response to climate changes occurring at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary, corresponding to a period of major global ecological change (reviewed by LaJeunesse 2005).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ARTICLE IN PRESS</head><p>Diversification of Symbiodinium in coral reef communities by the above process will lead to an increase in the level of genetic diversity of the genus Symbiodinium as a whole. But how is this variation maintained over space, as well as time, once it is created? By applying the idea that the ''host is a habitat'' from the viewpoint of Symbiodinium (and other microbes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Goulet and Coffroth 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Knowlton and Rohwer 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse et al. 2004b)</ref>, one avenue by which genetic diversity is maintained in these algae becomes apparent. For example, as discussed in the Introduction, Symbiodinium typically resides within the host's cells. It is reasonable to assume that subtle biochemical differences exist between identical cell types in congener host species. Thus, each can be considered distinct niches for unique Symbiodinium to occupy. This appears to be the case for Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata and P. elisabethae, Caribbean gorgonians that acquire their symbionts horizontally and occur sympatrically, yet harbor distinct Symbiodinium ''types'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Santos et al. 2004)</ref>. Another layer can be added to this: morphological and structural complexity within a given host creates additional niches, which other ''types'' of Symbiodinium can exploit. An example of this is Montastraea sp., in which members of Symbiodinium clades C and A predominately occur on the sides and top, respectively, of the same colonies <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rowan et al. 1997)</ref>. A similar pattern is seen in A. tenuis, where variants of clade C are found in light and shaded portions of the same colony <ref type="bibr">(van Oppen et al. 2001)</ref>. Lastly, the environment in which a host occurs will also define the niche particular symbionts can occupy. For members of the M. annularis complex, colonies found at inshore habitats hosted members of clade D while colonies of the same species at offshore sites harbored Symbiodinium clade C <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Toller et al. 2001a)</ref>. Thus, the host is by no means a static entity and should be considered a strong selective force in the creation and maintenance of genetic variation in Symbiodinium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directions for Future Research within Cnidarian-Symbiodinium Symbioses</head><p>We have presented a summary of the extensive genetic diversity within the genus Symbiodinium that has been revealed over the past decade through the application of molecular techniques. However, one vexing question remains unresolved: which molecule(s) differentiates a species within this genus ? The ''species problem'' is also relative to studies of their hosts and our inability to discriminate species for either partner is particularly troublesome. For instance, if we cannot make a distinction between species, questions such as ''How does the diversity within Symbiodinium compare with that of the host?'' are difficult or impossible to answer. <ref type="bibr">Pochon and co-workers (2001)</ref> presented an in-depth view of symbiont diversity within the soritid foraminifera, but this level of detail is lacking for other hosts. The symbiont ''types'' that we label ''Clade B'', or chloroplast 23S-rDNA type B184, or ITS2 type B1, are not equivalent <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig.  3)</ref>. Within the B184/B1 group, analysis of microsatellites and the regions flanking the repeats reveal high levels of variation, but it is unclear whether this variation characterizes the population genetics of a single species or variation between independently evolving taxa <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Santos et al. 2004)</ref>. Thus, what is a ''species'' in this enigmatic group? Until the ''species'' question is resolved for Symbiodinium, it will remain difficult to compare levels of diversity and fully address questions of host specificity and coevolution.</p><p>As we make great strides in understanding this complex system, each discovery leads to new questions. For example, one area that is important to understanding the system, but is as yet relatively unstudied, is the availability and nature of free-living Symbiodinium. Viable Symbiodinium are routinely released into the environment by a range of cnidarians <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Steele 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Stimson and Kinzie 1991)</ref> and predators feeding on the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Augustine and Muller-Parker 1998)</ref>. In addition, Symbiodinum have been isolated from the water column as well as coral sands <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Carlos et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chang 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gou et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Loeblich and Sherley 1979)</ref>. Although these isolates fall within the genus Symbiodinium, work is still required to establish that these dinoflagellates are able to colonize a host and establish a viable symbiosis. Other questions also need to be considered, including how large are these populations and whether their physiology differs relative to when they are sequestered within a hosts' tissues. Identifying free-living Symbiodinium and characterizing their potential as symbionts is a necessary first step in determining the environmental pool of symbionts that are available for initial colonization or recolonization after a disturbance.</p><p>Coral bleaching and mortality has increased steadily over the last two decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gardner et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hoegh-Guldberg 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hughes et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Pandolfi et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wilkinson 2000)</ref> and many argue that corals reefs are now threatened on a global scale. Variation in symbiont diversity, as seen over depth and geographic range, may offer important insights to understanding the tolerance and plasticity of coral species to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Does Symbiodinium diversity provide these symbioses with mechanisms to survive these changes? It has been proposed that bleaching is an adaptive mechanism allowing hosts to obtain symbionts better suited to the changing environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Buddemeier and Fautin 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Buddemeier et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rowan and Powers 1991a)</ref>. Tests of this hypothesis offer varying levels of support. Studies have shown that corals recovering from bleaching can harbor Symbiodinium that differ physiologically from the pre-bleaching populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baker 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baker et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Toller et al. 2001b)</ref>, with the source of symbionts arising from residual populations within the host or exogenously from environmental pools (Lewis and Coffroth 2004). However, although there is evidence suggesting corals have the potential to shuffle or switch partners, there is little real indication that this occurs in an unmanipulated setting (see <ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse et al. 2004a</ref><ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse et al. , 2005</ref>. In fact, most studies find that in the field, host-Symbiodinium pairings are stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Goulet and Coffroth 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">LaJeunesse et al. 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Glynn et al. (2001)</ref> documented that during a bleaching episode in the Eastern Pacific, those corals with a C ''type'' symbiont suffered bleaching, while those corals with the ''more stress tolerant'' D ''type'' symbiont did not bleach. In the Persian Gulf/Indian Ocean, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baker et al. (2004)</ref> report an increase in the number of corals with ''type'' D symbionts 2-4 years following a bleaching event. Although these studies suggest important physiological variation among Symbiodinium ''types'', it is not clear that individual corals ''switched'' or ''shuffled'' symbionts. In studies where individual corals are followed, there is a fundamental need for evidence demonstrating that the ''new'' symbiosis is stable and that these particular corals survive and proliferate in the future before bleaching can be truly labeled ''adaptive''. Additional questions also need to be addressed: Will those corals harboring new dominant symbionts following a bleaching event be able to sustain reefs on a global scale? If not, what impact will this have on the continual existence of reefs? For holobionts that are selected against, will their loss be temporary or permanent, and how will this affect overall coral reef diversity? Quantifying and characterizing Symbiodinium diversity both at the genetic and physiological levels will be important in predicting holobiont responses to the forecasted global warming trend as well as prescribing remedial action that should occur.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Photomicrograph of Symbiodinium kawagutii, isolated from Montipora verrucosa.

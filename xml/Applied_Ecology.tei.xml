				<p>Applied Ecology An organisms[sic] can be conceptualized as a living system that receives dietary inputs and converts these into biomass for reproduction, cell renewal, or would[sic] healing, and into energy to sustain daily tasks at the cellular and organismal levels [86]. We share our world with thousands of species of plants and animals we can see (macroscopic) and thousands of species of microbes we cannot see (microscopic). This microbial world is surprising and awesomedsurprising because it contains such a wealth of different forms of life, and awesome because we are learning just how essential microbes are and how they affect our world [16]. BIOREMEDIATION Chances are, if one were to ask a group of environmental engineers to define &quot;environmental biotechnology,&quot; there would be agreement among them that it has to do with putting biology to work to treat pollutants. Biotechnologists might agree, but may emphasize the &quot;technology&quot; over the &quot;environment&quot; in the application. Many scientists and engineers who apply life science principles will enthusiastically agree with the two quotes above. The bioengineer may also add that the field is more inclusive than simply solving problems, but also would use living organisms to find better ways to prevent pollution, such as innovative, green technologies like harnessing algae as energy sources. Certainly, all of these statements are correct, but none completely characterizes &quot;environmental biotechnology.&quot; The environmental engineering community may limit the use of the term &quot;environmental biotechnology&quot; to apply exclusively to microbes (although, they would also likely appreciate the role of plants in phytoremediation). Indeed, some engineers consider environmental biotechnology to fall completely within the domain of microbial ecology [67,69]. Microbial communities are able to degrade and detoxify contaminants in any environmental media, most commonly in water and soil, but also in sediment and biosolids (i.e., sludge). They can also convert the various organic compounds to compounds that can be more readily used to produce energy, e.g., methane (CH) [68]. These results are generally achieved via microbial metabolism, especially catalyzed redox reactions. As has been discussed thus far, even when biotechnologies work as designed there loom potential and actual downsides, and the environment is the victim of many of these downsides. Most engineering texts are devoted to applications of sciences, so it should come as no surprise that the likelihood is fairly strong that a book pulled from the library shelf with &quot;environmental biotechnology&quot; in its title will largely if not exclusively deal in applications involving the degradation of pollutants. Although most bioengineering and scientific literature does indeed focus on the environmental applications of microbial ecology and biotechnologxy, the systems view requires that both the environmental applications and the environmental implications be considered together. The viewpoint that environmental biotechnology is the application of microbial ecology to treat pollutants is evident in the short courses offered during the third international symposium on bioremediation and sustainable environmental technologies [60], an event sponsored by the International Society of Environmental Biotechnology (ISEB) in the year 2015: l New Approaches for Assessment of Light, Nonaqueous Phase Liquid (LNAPL) Stability and Recovery l Advances in Geophysical Monitoring of Remediation Processes l State-of-the-Art Approach for Evaluating Monitored Natural Attenuation (Biological and Abiotic), Biostimulation and Bioaugmentation l</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>with the petrochemical revolution came more exotic chemical forms, especially organic compounds. When these found their way to soil and water, they presented major challenges to treatment, because the microbes had not previously come into contact with these compounds, so their ordinary metabolic processes of oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and other mechanisms lacked the ability to degrade these more complex chemical compounds. Sanitary engineering pioneers, such as Ross McKinney at the University of Kansas, knew that microbes are highly adaptive, especially in conditions of food scarcity and stress. Microbes (often soil bacteria, e.g., Pseudomonas spp.) became acclimated to various chemicals by withholding their ordinary food sources, requiring the microbes to adapt their own metabolic processes to make use of the previously unknown chemicals. Thus, the natural "pollution controls" provided by native microbial populations were adequate to deal with waste products under historical conditions. That is, the systems were not yet overwhelmed by amount and type of pollutant. The capacity began to be exceeded as the amounts increased exponentially as a result of industrialization and urbanization, and with increasingly complex molecules entering the environment as either intentionally synthesized as consumer products and drugs or emissions from combustion and other industrial and urban processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[73]</ref>.</p><p>Biotechnological advances, without doubt, have provided many benefits. Pollution is present throughout the globe. Chemicals that are useful in one place can find their way to the air, water, soil, and organisms in which they present an array of problems. They can adversely affect the health of people exposed to them. They can upset balances and functions of ecosystems. As such, society demands that these problematic chemicals must be removed and that resources be decontaminated. Engineers have known for many decades that biological systems and processes provide key solutions to these problems. Biotechnological advances in recent decades have supercharged the natural processes used by engineers for pollution abatement.</p><p>One means of reducing the environmental and public health risks is to change the chemical structure of compounds so that they do not bind or block receptor sites on cells. Slight changes in structure, such as the addition or deletion of a single atom or the arrangement of the same set of atoms (i.e., an isomer), can substantially reduce the likelihood of toxic effects elicited by a compound. Chemical compounds that are relatively easily broken down by microbes may be completely treated by common techniques. More persistent compounds will require intensive treatment systems that enhance the degradation either chemically or microbiologically by bacteria, including species of Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Mycobacterium. Concentrated wastes may require anaerobic treatment (in which molecular oxygen is absent) or facultative treatment (in which bacteria grow with or without molecular oxygen) to degrade the complex contaminant molecules into simpler compounds.</p><p>Pollutants can be transformed biologically by three specific mechanisms:  These processes can occur together and simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Use of a compound as an electron acceptor takes place under reducing conditions. Such biotransformation needs a source of carbon (i.e., the electron donor) for microbial growth and metabolism. For example, if the compound contains chlorine or other halogen, then reductive dehalogenation will occur. That is, the halogens that are bound to carbon and other elements are removed, usually reducing the toxicity of the compound. The electron donor carbon can be gained from various sources, both from natural and anthropogenically derived organic matter.</p><p>In an electron donor situation, the compound is used as the primary substrate (electron donor), so that the microbe gets its energy and organic carbon from the compound. This may occur under either aerobic and some anaerobic conditions. Lesser oxidized compounds (e.g., vinyl chloride, dichloroethylene, or 1,2-dichloroethane) are amenable to this mode of biotransformation.</p><p>Co-metabolism is the interaction "between enzyme specificity and metabolic regulation, the metabolic interdependence of microorganisms, and co-substrate requirements in the catabolism of xenobiotic compounds" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. When a compound is broken down by co-metabolism, the degradation is catalyzed by an enzyme that is fortuitously produced by the organisms for other purposes. The microbe does not directly benefit from the degradation of the compound. The biotransformation of the compound could actually be harmful or can inhibit growth and metabolism in a microbe. Co-metabolism has been most often observed in aerobic environments, but has potential under anaerobic conditions, as well.</p><p>These three processes are evidence that biotechnology is essentially a means of manipulating systems. Biotechnology takes advantage of the physics, chemistry, and biology that occurs within various species. The fundamental building block in physics is the particle. For chemistry, it is the atom. For chemical reactions, the basic unit is the element. The fundamental unit in living systems is the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Whether it is a self-contained organism, like that of bacteria or algae, or a part of a complex organism, like human beings, the cell is where the biochemical processes, for good or bad, take place. When operating effectively, cells are the factories that turn nutrients and energy into biomass through the processes of photosynthesis, metabolism, and ion exchanges in microbes and plants. In animals, the cell is the location of metabolism and respiration. These mechanisms unfortunately are often disrupted by environmental contaminants. They are also the processes that convert complex chemical contaminants into simpler, hopefully less toxic, forms through the process of biotransformation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>READY BIODEGRADABILITY TESTING</head><p>The extent and rate at which chemical compounds degrade in the environment depend on biological, especially microbial, metabolism. Although virtually all organic compounds are biodegradable, this varies substantially depending on the physicochemical properties of the compound and the environmental conditions. Biodegradability can be approached from either a theoretical or an empirical perspective. The theoretical approach considers the compound with respect to its molecular structure (e.g., aqueous solubility, molecular weight, molecular fragments, etc.) and applies these features to expected reactions in the environment. This is the basis of structureeactivity relationships (SARs), discussed in Chapter 8.</p><p>Regulatory and other advisory entities often rely on empirical tests. As evidence, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has established guidelines on how to estimate the potential biodegradability of a chemical substance in the environment based on screening tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[66]</ref>. A chemical is considered to be "readily biodegradable" if it passes a screening procedure. The first pass of this screening procedure is the "ready biodegradability test", which uses a relatively high concentration of the chemical (between 2 and 100 mg L À1 ) with abundantly available molecular oxygen, i.e., aerobic conditions. The microbial population consists of an inoculum taken from domestic sewage, secondary effluent, or activated sludge.</p><p>If the first screen is negative, i.e., the chemical compound is not considered "readily biodegradable," the procedure may employ other tests, including simulated environments. These simulations may resemble conditions of biological sewage treatment or in the natural environment. Such follow-up studies may also be employed for positive screens, such as when the risks of a chemical need greater precision regarding biodegradation, e.g., estimates of persistence in the environment. The OECD describes persistence as biodegradation half-life (DT 50 ), i.e., the time it takes to biodegrade 50% of the mass of the compound.</p><p>The OECD guidelines describe six follow-up tests: An indication of ready biodegradation is indicated if !70% DOC removal in the TG A and TG 301 E tests; !60% theoretical carbon dioxide in the TG 301 B test; and !60% theoretical oxygen demand in the TG 301 C, TG 301 D, and TG 301 F tests. For all but the TG 301 C test, the findings must be reached in a 10-day window within a 29-day test period.</p><p>These inherent biodegradability tests may also be followed by tests that indicate potential anaerobic biodegradability, as well as likelihood of abiotic reactions, e.g., hydrolysis and phototransformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[66]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SYSTEMATIC VIEW OF OXYGEN</head><p>All inherent biodegradability tests described in the previous section are to some extent based on chemical reactions with oxygen. A distinction in environmental engineering applications often begins with whether oxygen is the electron acceptor. The first key question to ask is whether the potential biodegradation pathway is aerobic or anaerobic. Indeed, the pathway could include one or more steps, e.g., a step in which anaerobic microbes transform a molecule to some extent, followed by another step in which aerobic microbes further destroy the compound. These complementary processes occur in natural environments and in designed reactors. For example, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may first be degraded by anaerobic bacteria, which remove chlorine atoms. This makes the PCBs more vulnerable to further degradation by aerobic bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Oxygen, particularly in its molecular form O , is an essential factor in environmental biotechnology, as it limits most life forms, all higher order organisms, and all environmental systems. In fact, one of the key indicators of an environmental system's conditions is the availability of ample O 2 concentrations. When O 2 concentrations are depleted, the system becomes anoxic and less capable of sustaining diverse populations. Like other types of pollution, oxygen depletion can be direct or indirect. Some agents elicit direct toxic responses; however, certain contaminants are particularly harmful because they use up resources in the environment at the expense of other organisms. So, it is important to systematically consider rising and falling O 2 levels. Microbes are directly and indirectly involved in changing oxygen budgets in all environmental systems. That is, the available molecular oxygen determines abundance and diversity of microbial populations, which in turn use oxygen as a function of the metabolic processes, which affect the overall diversity, productivity, and sustainability of an ecosystem or the health of the organism in which the microorganisms reside.</p><p>Interestingly, O 2 depletion affects ecosystems unevenly and often in nonlinear ways. For example, lowering dissolved O 2 in surface waters will first adversely affect more sensitive aquatic species, such as trout, salmon, and other game fish. The lower O 2 concentrations may actually benefit "rough" fish like carp and buffalo until the waters are almost completely devoid of dissolved O 2 . Effects also vary according to life stages. Often, at lower oxygen levels, mature fish may live but not be able to reproduce effectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.3 shows that the combination of vulnerabilities during these different life stages will determine the ability of an aquatic population to thrive, or at least survive (in this instance, in saltwater). For example, below 4 mg L À1 dissolved O 2 an adult trout may not suffer acute effects, but trout larvae or young-of-the-year fish may not survive. Dissolved oxygen (DO) criteria apply to both continuous and cyclically depressed oxygen levels. If O 2 concentrations are continuously above the chronic criterion for growth (4.8 mg L À1 ), the aquatic life at that location should not be harmed. When dissolved oxygen conditions at a site fall below the juvenile/adult survival criterion (2.3 mg L À1 ), oxygen is insufficient to protect aquatic organisms. Thus, when conditions lead to persistently depressed oxygen levels, the DO concentrations will fall between the growth and survival levels. The duration and intensity of these depressed oxygen levels requires ongoing monitoring and, when necessary, actions may need to be taken to ensure that the aquatic ecosystem remains healthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Actions may include mechanical methods, e.g., aeration fountains, and decreasing the allowable amounts of oxygen-depleting compounds in effluents reaching the water body. It should be noted that even at very low O 2 concentrations, there may be sufficiently high amounts to elicit biodegradation. For example, in subsurface soils, recent studies have indicated that contaminant biodegradation is occurring aerobically at O 2 concentrations previously thought to be too low for such remediation. Thus, the so-called "two-category" model of oxic/anoxic conditions is likely too simple for real-world applications, because it requires a threshold O 2 concentration above which aerobic biodegradation is supported by electron-donor contaminants (e.g., petroleum-derived hydrocarbons), and below which anaerobic bacteria degraded electron-acceptor contaminants (e.g., chlorinated ethenes). There is a concentration at which both processes occur simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[61]</ref>.</p><p>Sources of oxygen depletion are direct when they chemically react with oxygen, decreasing the dissolved oxygen (DO) content of the water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Sources of oxygen depletion are indirect if they allow for large growth of bacteria, fungi, or algae that in turn uses up the oxygen. The total amount of oxygen used chemically (by agents other than living organisms) is known as chemical oxygen demand (COD). The amount used by microbes is known as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Naturally occurring organic matter, including organic wastes from sewage treatment plants, improperly operating septic systems, and runoff from agricultural and residential areas are the energy sources (i.e., "food") for water-borne bacteria. Bacteria decompose these organic materials using dissolved oxygen, thereby decreasing the DO present for aquatic life.</p><p>The BOD is the amount of oxygen that bacteria will consume in the process of decomposing organic matter under aerobic conditions. The BOD is measured by incubating a sealed sample of water for five days and measuring the loss of oxygen by comparing the O 2 concentration of the sample at time ¼ 0 (just before the sample is sealed) to the concentration at time ¼ 5 days (known specifically as BOD 5 ). Samples are commonly diluted before incubation to prevent the bacteria from depleting all of the oxygen in the sample before the test is complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>BOD <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> is simply the measured DO at the beginning time, i.e., the initial DO (D), measured immediately after it is taken from the source minus the DO of the same water measured exactly five days after D 1 , i.e., D <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">BOD ¼ D 1 À D 5 P (7.1)</formula><p>in which P ¼ decimal volumetric fraction of water utilized and D units are in mg L À1 . If the dilution water is seeded, the calculation becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">BOD ¼ ðD 1 À D 5 Þ À ðB 1 À B 5 Þf P (7.2)</formula><p>in which B 1 ¼ initial DO of seed control; B 5 ¼ final DO of seed control; and f ¼ the ratio of seed in sample to seed in control ¼ {% seed in D 1 /% seed in B 1 }. B units are in mg L À1 . For example, to find the BOD 5 value for a 10 mL water sample added to 300 mL of dilution water with a measured DO of 7 mg L À1 and a measured DO of 4 mg L À1 five days later: P ¼ 10 300 ¼ 0:03</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">BOD 5 ¼ 7 À 4 0:03 ¼ 100 mg L À1</formula><p>Thus, the microbial population in this water is demanding 100 mg L À1 dissolved oxygen over the five-day period. So, if a conventional municipal wastewater treatment system is achieving 95% treatment efficiency, the effluent discharged from this plant would be 5 mg L À1 .</p><p>Chemical oxygen demand (COD) does not differentiate between biologically available and inert organic matter, and it is a measure of the total quantity of oxygen required to oxidize all organic material completely to carbon dioxide and water. COD values always exceed BOD values for the same sample. COD (mg L À1 ) is measured by oxidation using potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7 ) in the presence of sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) and silver. By convention, 1 g of carbohydrate or 1 g of protein accounts for about 1 g of COD. On average, the ratio BOD:COD is 0.5. If the ratio is &lt;0.3, the water sample likely contains elevated concentrations of recalcitrant organic compounds, i.e., compounds that resist biodegradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (see Discussion Box: Recalcitrance). That is, there are numerous carbon-based compounds in the sample, but the microbial populations are not efficiently using them for carbon and energy sources. This is the advantage of having both BOD and COD measurements. Sometimes, however, COD measurements are conducted simply because they require only a few hours compared to the five days for BOD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Box</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recalcitrance</head><p>Certain molecules resist biodegradation in the environment. They are chemically persistent, but there is something about their structure that makes them unattractive as electron acceptors and donors to microbes. Although they may be rich in carbon, microorganisms seek carbon from more familiar and usually chemically simpler sources unless drastic conditions induce degradation, e.g., these molecules are the only food that is available or the microbes' genetics are engineered to alter their carbon preferences.</p><p>The term recalcitrance is anthropogenic. Recalcitrant chemicals are stubbornly resisting human controls. The microbes are not being blamed for the lack of degradation, but the chemical compounds themselves are, especially when stereochemistry and structural activity should be amenable to biodegradation. In fact, however, recalcitrance is a function of both the chemical structure and the microorganisms' preferences for electron acceptance and carbon.</p><p>Actually, recalcitrance is not limited to microorganisms but is also applied to plants. Plants have the inherent capacity to degrade xenobiotic pollutants, but they generally lack the catabolic pathway to provide complete degradation, i.e., mineralization, relative to microbes. In fact, current research is being directed toward the transfer of genes involved in xenobiotic degradation from microbes to plants to enhance specific plant taxons' potential for remediating more recalcitrant compounds, e.g., trichloroethylene, pentachlorophenol, trinitrotoluene (TNT), glycerol trinitrate, atrazine, ethylene dibromide, metolachlor, and hexahydro-1,3,5trinitro-1,3,5-triazine <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[80]</ref>.</p><p>In fact, phytodegradation and microbial biodegradation are interrelated and mutual. Plant evapotranspiration, plantemicrobe rhizosphere degradation, and microbial metabolic processes are combined. For example, in situ natural and engineered remediation projects take advantage of both plant life and microbial populations, with much of the degradation at the rootemicrobe interface (i.e., in the rhizosphere) in the soil (see and stored. In fact, recalcitrant compounds may be stored without metabolism for protracted periods. Phytodegradation, on the other hand, occurs when plants can metabolize a compound. The metabolism during phytodegradation may resemble that of animal degradation of toxic substances <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[81]</ref>.</p><p>The microbial-macrophytic rhizosphere stabilization and degradation are enhanced by the plant roots' release of cometabolites and by the roots' facilitating soil aeration (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.4). Thus, the physical contact and the biochemistry needed for degradation are improved when roots and microbes are both available in the right environment.</p><p>The chemicaleorganismeenvironmental systematics inevitably leads to the question, then, as to what are the properties of molecules that render them recalcitrant? Why do some compounds that should be broken down in fact persist in the environment for so long? Indeed, not only large molecules are recalcitrant. Some relatively low molecular weight compounds can last for years in the environment.</p><p>In addition, certain environmental conditions add to the likelihood of molecular recalcitrance. Therefore, the time it takes to break down molecules is a function of the structure of the molecule, the carbon preference of the organism, and the environmental conditions.</p><p>Because available carbon is a limiting factor, the carbonaceous BOD reaches a plateau, i.e., the ultimate carbonaceous BOD (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.5). However, carbonaceous compounds are not the only substances demanding oxygen. Microbial populations will continue to demand O 2 from the water to degrade other compounds, especially nitrogenous compounds, which account for the bump in the BOD curve. Thus, in addition to serving as an indication of the amount of molecular oxygen needed for biological treatment of the organic matter, BOD also provides a guide to sizing a treatment process, assigning its efficiency, and giving operators and regulators information about whether the facility is meeting its design criteria and is complying with pollution control permits.</p><p>If effluent with high BOD concentrations reaches surface waters, it may diminish DO to levels lethal to some fish and many aquatic insects. As the water body re-aerates as a result of mixing with the atmosphere and by algal photosynthesis, O 2 is added to the water, and the oxygen levels will slowly increase downstream. The drop and rise in DO concentrations downstream from a source of BOD is known as the DO sag curve, because the concentration of dissolved oxygen "sags" as the microbes deplete it. So, the falling O 2 concentrations fall with both time and distance from the point in which the high BOD substances enter the water (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPLIED THERMODYNAMICS</head><p>Biotechnology began as a passive approach. For example, sanitary engineers noted that natural systems, such as surface waters and soil, were able to break down organic materials. As they studied these processes, they realized that various genera of microbes had the ability to use detritus on forest floors, suspended organic material in water, and organic material  adsorbed onto soil particles as sources of energy need for growth, metabolism, and reproduction. The engineers correctly hypothesized that a more concentrated system could be fabricated to do the same thing with society's organic wastes. Thus, trickling filters, oxidation ponds, landfills, and other wastewater and solid waste treatment systems are merely supercharged versions of natural systems (see Discussion Box: Landfill Bioreactors).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Box</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Landfill Bioreactors</head><p>No matter where one lives in most of the world, chances are good that a pile of solid waste is nearby. Greater than 230 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) is generated in the United States annually, of which 57 percent reaches an MSW landfill <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[75]</ref>. Most of the MSW landfills currently in service are regulated under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, mainly to minimize risk to human health and the environment. Much of the potential risk from MSW landfills results from the migration of contaminated leachate and landfill gas (LFG). Thus, bioengineers are challenged to address contamination in two phases, liquid and solid, which are transported offsite by advection and other processes (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.9). In North America, landfill regulations call for a system that minimizes liquid infiltration into the solid waste mass by controlling the amount of moisture allowed into these landfills. These so-called "dry tomb" landfill designs produce strata within the bioreactor system with low moisture content. Although this decreases the amount of leachate, it also severely limits biodegradation, because moisture is a limiting factor for biofilm production and microbial metabolism. Thus, the likelihood of undegraded contaminants increases, as does their associated risk because the exposure integration time is protracted. These exposures include emissions from fugitive dust, combustion from the flare, microbial releases, and the migration of contaminants through soil, groundwater, and surface waters. This is the rationale for long-term monitoring around these sites, e.g., current regulations require leachate and LFG emissions to be monitored for at least 30 years after closure of a landfill site or even longer if there is reason to believe the risks continue after that time.</p><p>A number of small-and large-scale projects have demonstrated that the rate of microbial degradation of solid wastes in these landfills can be enhanced, especially by increasing the moisture content of the waste. This can be by increasing the amount of water in the strata and by leachate recirculation <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[76]</ref> (in most currently operated landfills the leachate is collected and treateddsee Figure 7.7).</p><p>Waste arrives and is stored in a landfill on an ongoing basis so the age of the waste between the cells and within the cells (e.g., cells within layers) can vary considerably. Because degradation is a function of time, this means that the chemical conversion between and within cells will also vary, meaning that the chemical speciation within a landfill varies within two and three dimensions in space. That is, the age of the waste will affect the amount of oxidation ereduction, pH, and other important environmental conditions within each of the landfill's cells. As can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.7, the different landfill stabilization phases often overlap and can be viewed with regard to each phase's role within the system. The initial phase results in aerobic decomposition followed by four stages of anaerobic degradation. Thus, the majority of landfill decomposition by 6 Dissolved oxygen sag curve downstream from an oxygen-depleting contaminant source. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in Curve A remains above 0, so although the available oxygen is reduced, the system remains aerobic. Curve B sags where dissolved oxygen falls to 0, and anaerobic conditions result and continue until the DO concentrations begin to increase. D S is the background oxygen deficit before the pollutants enter the stream. D 0 is the oxygen deficit after the pollutant is mixed. D is the deficit for contaminant A which may be measured at any point downstream. This indicates both distance and time of microbial exposure to the source. For example, if the stream's average velocity is 5 km h À1 , D measured 10 km downstream also represents 2 h of microbial activity to degrade the pollutant.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Boxdcont'd</head><p>volume occurs under anaerobic conditions. Generally, biodegradation follows three basic stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[77]</ref>:</p><p>The organic material in solid phase (represented by chemical oxygen demand, i.e., COD S ) decays rapidly as larger organic molecules degrade into smaller molecules. These smaller organic molecules in the solid phase undergo dissolution and move to the liquid phase (COD L ), with subsequent hydrolysis of these organic molecules. The smaller molecules are transformed and volatilize as CO 2 and CH 4 , with remaining biomass in solid and liquid phases.</p><p>During the first two phases, little material volume reaches the leachate. However, the biodegradable organic matter of the waste undergoes a rapid decrease in volume. Meanwhile, the leachate COD accumulates as a result of excesses of more recalcitrant compounds compared to the more reactive compounds in the leachate.</p><p>These three steps can be further grouped into five phases by which degradation occurs in a landfill bioreactor system, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.8. Successful conversion and stabilization of the waste depends on how well microbial populations function in syntrophy (i.e., an interaction of different populations that supply each other's nutritional needs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase I: Initial Adjustment</head><p>In environmental microbiology this phase is referred to as the lag phase. As the waste is placed in the landfill, the void spaces contain high volumes of molecular oxygen (O 2 ). As additional wastes are added and compacted, the O 2 content of the landfill bioreactor strata gradually decreases. With increasing moisture, the microbial population density increases, initiating aerobic biodegradation, i.e., the primary electron acceptor is O 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase II: Transition</head><p>This phase is short-lived as the O 2 is rapidly degraded by the existing microbial populations. The decreasing O 2 results in a transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions in the stratum. The primary electron acceptors during transition are nitrates and sulfates, because O 2 is rapidly displaced by CO 2 in the effluent gas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase III: Acid Formation</head><p>Hydrolysis of the biodegradable fraction of the solid waste begins in the acid formation phase, which leads to rapid accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the leachate. The increased organic acid content decreases the leachate pH from approximately 7.5 to 5.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[78]</ref>. During this phase, the decomposition intermediate compounds like the VFAs contribute much COD. Long-chain volatile organic acids (VOAs) are converted to acetic acid (C 2 H 4 O 2 ), CO 2 , and hydrogen gas (H 2 ). High concentrations of VFAs increase both the BOD and VOA concentrations, which initiates H production by fermentative bacteria, which stimulates the growth of H 2oxidizing bacteria. The H -generation phase is relatively short because it is complete by the end of the acid formation phase.</p><p>As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.8, this phase also is accompanied by an increase in the biomass of acidogenic bacteria and rapid degradation of substrates and consumption of nutrients.</p><p>Because metals are generally more water soluble at lower pH, metallic compounds may become more mobile during this phase.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Boxdcont'd</head><p>Phase IV: Methane Fermentation The acid formation phase intermediary products (e.g., acetic, propionic, and butyric acids) are converted to CH 4 and CO 2 by methanogenic microorganisms. As VFAs are metabolized by the methanogens, the landfill water pH returns to neutrality. The organic strength (i.e., oxygen demand) of the leachate decreases at a rapid rate as gas production increases in correspondence with increases in CH 4 and CO 2 gas production. This is the longest-lived waste decomposition phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase V: Final Maturation and Stabilization</head><p>The rate of microbiological activity slows during the last phase of waste decomposition as the supply of nutrients limits the chemical reactions, e.g., as bioavailable phosphorus becomes increasingly scarce. CH 4 production almost completely disappears, with O 2 and oxidized species gradually reappearing in the gas wells as O 2 permeates downwardly from the troposphere. This transforms the oxidationereduction potential (ORP) in the leachate toward oxidative processes. The residual organic materials may incrementally be converted to the gas phase, and as organic matter is composted; i.e., the organic matter is converted to humic-like compounds (although these processes have not yet been completely scientifically documented within a landfill system).</p><p>On-site degradation, such as that which occurs in a landfill, is carried out by different genera of microbes, making the kinetics difficult to predict for any facility. Such microbial populations occur naturally in the landfill (e.g., natural soil bacteria). However, varying temporal and spatial site-specific conditions to achieve optimal performance is often a heuristic process. The kinetics of microorganisms in landfill bioreactors have not been widely investigated, likely because these groups of microorganisms are much more difficult than aerobes to culture. Hopefully, the emergence of molecular-based nonculture techniques will increase this information. To date, landfill bioreactor performance has been evaluated and controlled by indirect evidence, e.g., waste stabilization is characterized by monitoring the outcome of the decomposition process. For example, recirculation of leachate has been shown to shorten the initial lag phase, even though the microbial species responsible for this accelerated decomposition have not been precisely identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[79]</ref>.</p><p>Bioengineering improvements to a landfill bioreactor requires attention to the sensitivity of variables. Finding methods to improve efficiency depends on optimizing microbiological metabolic processes. For example, the amount of leachate to be recirculated affects the quantity of organic acids. If VFA concentrations are high, methanogenesis can be inhibited. This is not a direct inhibition of microbial metabolism, but a response of the microbial population to the lower pH induced by the VFAs. Thus, the volume of recirculated leachate must be adjusted to minimize the accumulation of VFAs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.9).</p><p>Thus, effective degradation depends on matching the abiotic and biotic conditions in a bioreactor with the needs of the microbial population. Environmental biotechnologies are designed to enhance and control these relationships. In such a passive system, the biotechnology makes use of the same microbes that have adapted metabolic processes to degrade an array of organic compounds in natural settings, but they have been allowed to acclimate to the organic material that needs to be broken down. The microbes' inherent or adaptive preference to have more easily and directly derived electron transfer (i.e., energy sources) must be overcome. Environmental biotechnologists have accomplished this by limiting the microbes to an exclusively available carbon and energy source. That is, the bioengineer only permits the microorganism population, under a control setting, to come into contact with the chemicals in the waste. Thus, the microbes adapt their biological processes to use these formerly unfamiliar compounds as their energy sources and, in the process, break them down into less toxic substances. Ultimately the microbes degrade complex organic waste to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of molecular oxygen. In the absence of molecular oxygen, the microbes degrade the organic waste into methane and water. These are known as aerobic and anaerobic digestion, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continued</head><p>Numerous examples of passive systems have been put to use as society has become increasingly complex. Human systems have evolved to support the need for safe food supplies, clean water and air, better shelter, and urbanization. For example, passive biotechnologies were needed to allow for large-scale agriculture, including hybrid crops and nutrient cycling in agriculture. Likewise, biomedical advances, such as vaccines, have often led to other societal change, e.g., better living standards, and disease treatment and prevention.</p><p>Very recently, more active systems have been used increasingly to achieve such societal gains, but at an exponentially faster pace. In addition, scientists have developed biotechnologies that produce products that simply would not exist in passive systems.</p><p>The relationships between organisms and their environments reveal themselves in cycles of matter and energy into and out of the organism. This means that the organism itself is a thermodynamic control volume. In turn, the population of organisms is part of the larger control volumes (e.g., microbes in the intestine; the intestine in the animal; the herd as prey in a habitat; the habitat as part of an ecosystem's structure).</p><p>Smaller control volumes assimilate into larger ones. Within reactors are smaller-scale reactors (e.g., within the fish liver, on a soil particle, or in the pollutant plume or a forest). Thus, scale and complexity can vary by orders of magnitude in environmental systems. For example, the human body is a system, but so is the liver, and so are the collections of tissues FIGURE 7.9 Effects of leachate recirculation on volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation compared to VFA generation under conventional landfill management. The leachate in "Reactor 9" was recirculated at 9 L day À1 (2.4 gallons per dayegpd) ¼ 13% of the reactor volume. The leachate in "Reactor 21" was recirculated at 21 L day À1 (5.5 gpd) ¼ 30% of the reactor volume. The VFA buildup in the reactor with a higher leachate recirculation rate of 21 L day À1 (5.5 gpd) was nearly as high as the VFAs generated in the single-pass (i.e., conventional) reactor. through which mass and energy flow as the liver performs its function. Each hepatic cell in the liver is a system. At the other extreme, large biomes that make up large parts of the earth's continents and oceans are systems, both from the standpoint of biological organization and thermodynamics.</p><p>The interconnectedness of these systems is crucial to understanding biotechnological implications, because mass and energy relationships between and among systems determine the efficiencies of all living systems. For example, if a toxin adversely affects a cell's energy and mass transfer rates, it could have a cumulative effect on the tissue and organs of the organism. And, if the organisms that make up a population are less efficient in survival, then the balances needed in the larger systems, e.g., ecosystems and biomes, may be changed, causing problems at the global scale. Viewing this from the other direction, a larger system can be stressed, such as changes in ambient temperature levels or the increased concentrations of contaminants in water bodies and the atmosphere. This results in changes all the way down to the subcellular levels (e.g., higher temperatures or the presence of foreign chemicals at a cell's membrane will change the efficiencies of uptake, metabolism, replication, and survival). Thus, the changes at these submicroscopic scales determine the value of any biotechnology.</p><p>At very high levels of biological organization, i.e., the biomes, the very large are linked and interact with each other, such as the way that coral reef systems are inextricably connected to distant continental deserts, as will be addressed in this chapter's seminar discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIODEGRADATION AND BIOREMEDIATION</head><p>Extracting a microbe from the environment and exposing it to a target contaminant under controlled conditions is one means of breaking the contaminant down into less toxic components. This is the goal of bioremediation. Microbes, or even higher organisms like plants (phytoremediation) and animals, can reduce the potential toxicity of chemical contaminants by transforming, degrading, and/or immobilizing these compounds in the environment. Environmental scientists and engineers know a great deal about the pathways for organic degradation, and the degradation mechanisms. Such treatment processes include co-metabolism, anaerobic biotransformations of highly chlorinated solvents, and alternate electron acceptors are used frequently in controlled bioremediation efforts.</p><p>Living organisms can enzymatically and otherwise attack numerous organic chemicals and break them down to lesser toxic chemical species. This is known as biodegradation. Bioengineers classify pollutants with respect to the ease of degradation and types of processes that are responsible for this degradation, sometimes referred to as treatability.</p><p>Depending on the compound of concern and the species doing the attack, the resulting compounds at the end of the process can vary substantially. The products of complete biodegradation (i.e., mineralization) are carbon dioxide and water. Anything short of mineralization will produce compounds that are usually simpler (e.g., cleaved rings, removal of halogens), but with physical and chemical characteristics different from the parent compound. In addition, side reactions can produce compounds with varying levels of toxicity and mobility in the environment.</p><p>Using microbes to destroy or to reduce the toxicity of pollutants is known as bioremediation. The biochemical reactions responsible for bioremediation usually take place in water, soil, or sediment, and most recently in the air. Environmental biotechnology can use any organism to treat a pollutant. The bioengineer must acclimate the organisms to the compound to be degraded. For much of the history of sanitary and environmental engineering, such acclimation occurred by changing the conditions of the microbial environment so that the microbes use the wastes as their food and energy source, hopefully almost exclusively. For example, the soil bacterium Pseudomonas spp. can obtain its food from various sources within the soil substrate. However, the bioengineer can withhold most of these other sources and expose the bacterium to municipal wastes, so that the bacteria adapt their metabolic processes to use, and consequently break down, the organic matter in this exclusive waste.</p><p>The bioengineer now has some additional tools to break down wastes. In fact, the acclimation process can be reversed. Rather than changing the conditions of the microbial environment, the bioengineer can change the microbes to be selective in food choices. In other words, the microbe's genetic material is modified so that its food choice is whatever the organic matter contains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOCHEMODYNAMICS OF BIOREMEDIATION</head><p>Organisms break down compounds by anabolic and catabolic metabolism. Bioremediation is the ability to use this process to destroy and/or detoxify contaminants, usually microbes. Incidentally, there are millions of indigenous species of microbes living at any given time within many soil environments. The bioengineer simply needs to create an environment in which those microbes are able to use a particular compound as their energy source.</p><p>Pollutants can be degraded microbially under various scenarios, ranging from simply monitoring the rate of natural processes without any engineering intervention (i.e., intrinsic bioremediation) to increasing interventions, such as adding nutrients and oxygen to manipulation the genetic features of microbes to enhance the degradation rates and amounts and/or to target specific chemical substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[64]</ref>.</p><p>Biodegradation processes had been observed empirically for centuries, but putting them to use as a distinct field of bioremediation arguably began with the work of R. L. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Raymond et al. in 1975</ref>. This seminal study found that the addition of nutrients to soil increases the abundance of bacteria that was associated with a proportional degradation of hydrocarbons, in this case petroleum byproducts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Hence, enhanced in situ bioremediation was born.</p><p>Bioremediation success depends on the growth and survival of microbial populations and the ability of these organisms to come into contact with the substances that need to be degraded into less toxic compounds. There must be sufficient numbers of microorganisms to make bioremediation successful, thus are an essential criterion for selecting the preferred cleanup option. Also, the microbial environment must be habitable for the microbes to thrive. Sometimes, concentrations of compounds can be so high that the environment is toxic to microbial populations. Therefore, the bioengineer must either use a method other than bioremediation or modify the environment (e.g., dilution, change in pH, pumped oxygen, adding organic matter, etc.) to make it habitable. An important modification is the removal of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) because the microbes' biofilm and other mechanisms usually work best when the microbe is attached to a particle. Thus, most of the NAPLs need to be removed, including by vapor extraction.</p><p>Contaminants, organisms, and electron acceptors and donors must come into contact with one another. The confluence of biochemodynamic factors drives the selection of bioremediation strategy. For example, low-permeability soils, like clays, are difficult to treat, because liquids (water, solutes, and nutrients) are difficult to pump through these systems. Usually bioremediation works best in soils that are relatively sandy, allowing mobility and greater likelihood of contact between the microbe and the contaminant. Thus, an understanding of the environmental conditions sets the stage for problem formulation (i.e., identification of the factors at work and the resulting threats to health and environmental quality) and risk management (i.e., what are the various options available to address these factors and how difficult it will be to overcome obstacles or to enhance those factors that make remediation successful).</p><p>Thus, bioremediation is a process of optimization by selecting options among a number of biological, chemical, and physical factors. These include correctly matching the degrading microbes to conditions, understanding and controlling the movement of the contaminant (microbial food) so as to come into contact with the microbes, and characterizing the abiotic conditions controlling both of these factors. Optimization can vary among options, such as artificially adding microbial populations known to break down the compounds of concern. Compound degradation can be quite specific to microbial genera. Only a few species can break down certain organic compounds. The number of microbe genera that can degrade a molecule decreases with the complexity of the molecule, including the presence of certain functional groups (e.g., Cl and Br substitution).</p><p>Two major limiting factors of any biodegradation process are toxicity to the microbial population and inherent biodegradability of the compound. As the biology of microbial biodegradation has become better understood (e.g., mechanisms and modes of action), efficacy has improved. For example, the methanogenic granular sludge structure has been found to play a key role in high-rate anaerobic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Granular sludge is an excellent example of a system, because it is an aggregation of several metabolic groups of bacteria living in synergism. The factors that make granular sludge environments hospitable for these bacteria may be replicated in other environments, both in situ and ex situ.</p><p>The transport processes described in Chapter 3 are crucial to bioremediation. Leachate collection systems (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.7) provide a way to collect wastes that can then be treated. However, such "pump and treat" systems can produce air pollutants. Actually, this is often intentional. For example, groundwater is treated by drilling recovery wells to pump contaminated groundwater to the surface. Commonly used groundwater treatment approaches include air stripping, filtering with granulated activated carbon (GAC), and air sparging. Air stripping transfers volatile compounds from water to air (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.10). Groundwater is allowed to drip downward in a tower filled with a permeable material through which a stream of air flows upward. Another method bubbles pressurized air through contaminated water in a tank. The air leaving the tank (i.e., the off-gas) is treated by removing gaseous pollutants. Filtering groundwater with GAC entails pumping the water through the GAC to trap the contaminants. In air sparging, air is pumped into the groundwater to aerate the water. Most often, a soil venting system is combined with an air sparging system for vapor extraction, with the gaseous pollutants treated, as in air stripping.</p><p>Regulatory agencies often require two or three pairs of these systems as design redundancies to protect the integrity of a hazardous waste storage or treatment facility. A primary leachate collection and treatment system must be designed like the bottom of the landfill bathtub. This leachate collection system must be graded to promote the flow of liquid within the landfill from all points in the landfill to a central collection point(s) where the liquid can be pumped to the surface for subsequent monitoring and treatment. Crushed stone and perforated pipes are used to channel the liquid along the top layer of this compacted clay liner to the pumping locations.</p><p>Thus, directly treating hazardous wastes physically and chemically, as with thermal systems and indirectly controlling air pollutants as when gases are released from pump and treat systems, requires a comprehensive approach. Otherwise, we are merely moving the pollutants to different locations or even making matters worse by either rendering some contaminants more toxic or exposing receptors to dangerous substances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OFF-SITE TREATMENT</head><p>Numerous bioremediation projects include both in situ and ex situ components in treating wastes. Perhaps some of the soil or groundwater contains such high levels of persistent and toxic compounds that this portion needs to be excavated and transported to an off-site, intensive treatment facility. Other times, the treatment facility is built on site or nearby, so that shipping costs are reduced. These may be modular facilities, such as mobile incinerators or on-site bioreactors. The advantage of ex situ biological systems is that they can be controlled and managed much more extensively, which allows for more efficient and rapid nutrient augmentations, oxygen levels, dilutions, additions of microbes known to metabolize with pathways conducive to the electron acceptors (anaerobic or aerobic systems), and the ability to have serial reactions, including anaerobic and aerobic steps (e.g., for halogen substitutions and ring cleavages of aromatic compounds).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DIGESTION</head><p>Biodegradation by aerobic microbes mimics natural systems. That is, those microbes that use oxygen as the electron acceptor are often the same as those found in natural systems and their survival and growth are similar to that in nature, albeit often at a more rapid rate.</p><p>Microbes degrade substrates and grow according to the Monod equation (Eqn (7.13) below). Usually, the Monodconstant K ranges between 1 and 10 g m À3 for organic substrates, compared to 0.1 g m À3 for oxygen. Whereas the liquids in bioreactors are frequently greater than the Monod constant K, so they follow a zero-order growth curve (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.11), if all other environmental conditions are equal (e.g., nutrient concentrations, pH, temperature, toxicities) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Many biologically mediated processes that degrade contaminants are redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from an organic contaminant to an electron acceptor. In these cases, oxygen is the electron acceptor if the process is aerobic (i.e., sufficient molecular oxygen is available). In anaerobic microbial processes, Fe 3þ , sulfate, and carbon dioxide can be the electron acceptors. The redox reactions for the commonly encountered contaminants benzene and substituted derivatives of benzene (i.e., xylene and ethylbenzene) are shown in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>.1.</p></div>

With falling dissolved oxygen concentrations, anaerobic bacteria will begin to dominate in degrading organic wastes. The transfer of electrons is the means by which the microbes receive energy from the food (i.e., the organic waste).</p><p>The process of adding nutrients to contaminated sites, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, oxygen, and other elements and compounds that serve as electron acceptors to stimulate the activity of microbial populations is known as biostimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Bioaugmentation is the process of adding microbes to the subsurface environment. The microbes can come from "seed" microbes taken from the contaminated environment and mixing them with these elements and compounds in a reactor, and then reintroducing them to the contaminated soil or water, especially groundwater. Other times, special targeted and cultivated strains, including genetically modified microorganisms, with known abilities to degrade certain compounds, are injected into contaminated soil and groundwater. Many bioremediation experts favor biostimulation over bioaugmentation because almost every subsurface, indigenous microbial species has likely already developed enzyme production systems that will break down the contaminants. Conversely, the exogenous species that were augmented elsewhere may not survive the new, hostile environment after introduction.</p><p>A hybrid of biostimulation and vapor extraction is known as bioventing. This type of remediation stimulates the growth and metabolism of aerobic bacteria in contaminated soil by applying a vacuum at depth underground. Holes are drilled around the perimeter of contamination. Air is pulled from the surface to the lower pressure zone created by the vacuum pump, and flows through the contaminated soil. If the organic contaminants have a sufficiently high vapor pressure (i.e., volatile organic compounds), they will be pulled from the vadose (unsaturated) zone of soil or other unconsolidated matter, will flow upward and will enter a chamber in which the vapors are treated. Obviously, the two limiting factors for bioventing are the vapor pressure of the contaminants and the permeability of the soil. Another variation is biosparging, wherein air is pumped into and through groundwater in the saturated zone to enhance volatilization and biodegradation.</p><p>The first-order biodegradation rate (R) can be calculated empirically from two representative points within a plume:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">R ¼ ln C d C u ðDvÞ (7.3)</formula><p>in which: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.12 illustrates the three prototypical microbial decay curves, in which the beginning and ending amounts of contamination are the same but the rates or kinetics of the three systems are different. The mathematics of the three orders of decay kinetics have been derived from experimental data. Although very useful in understanding the theory and first principles of degradation, especially biodegradation, they must be adapted to the heterogeneous conditions of the field, especially for in situ bioremediation, and the expected growth and metabolism of microbes that catalyze contaminants.

When the substrate is not limiting, i.e., a lot of contaminant (food) is available to the microbes, the contaminant is degraded as a function of the logarithmic growth of the microbes, following zero-order kinetics (constant: log growth and log decay). When the rate of degradation of the chemical contaminant becomes directly proportional to the concentration of the contaminant, the decay follows first-order kinetics.</p><p>One of the more realistic biological kinetics scenarios is second order. That is, the first-order kinetics are related to microbial population density. Over time the realistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> biodegradation rate may cycle through various orders over the life of a remediation project, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.13. Modelers often consider microbial degradation rates to be nonlinear  reactions, possibly because of the dearth of information available supporting stepwise degradation, especially in natural systems. Thus, they have developed biodegradation models to fit the results, expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Àd½A ¼ k½A n Àd½A dt ¼ k½A n (7.10)</formula><p>in which n is the rate curve-fitting parameter. Numerous factors may account for why bioremediation does not follow the theoretical decay expected if degradation depended only on total concentration of the contaminant chemical species. Microbial populations not only must degrade soil concentrations that are (readily) available to the microbes, but also the water-borne fraction (e.g., in the water-filled pore spaces of the soil and unconsolidated media). For nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs), which comprise many of the organic contaminants, much of the contaminant is not in a soluble form. Many contaminants have strong affinity for soil particles due to their sorption coefficients, so they resist diffusion. They may also be physically encapsulated within the soil matrices. The bioengineer may need to consider conditioning the soil and pore water (e.g., with surfactants) to overcome some of these factors that limit contact between microbes and chemical contaminants. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.14 illustrates an idealized biodegradation growth curve, which has well-defined stages. The extent and duration of each stage will of course vary according to the microbial species and environmental conditions.</p><p>Thus, engineered systems bring the chemical contaminant into contact with the microbes and enhance the degradation environment, such as by pumping nutrients and air (or pure oxygen) into the groundwater. Engineered systems may also add activated microbes (if indigenous microbes are not already breaking down the chemical) into the vadose or saturated zones. As these conditions change, the microbes undergo a series of stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>:</p><p>1. Lag phase: Upon initial exposure of the microbes to the chemical contaminant, a period of time is needed for the organisms to become acclimated. 2. Accelerated growth rate phase: Following acclimation, the microbes propagate at an increasing rate. There are two major processes that allow for the degradation of chemical compounds by microbes: a. The most effective is when the organisms use the contaminant as a food source for their growth, metabolism, and reproduction. This is accomplished by the microbe's ability to produce enzymes that catalyze the chemical contaminant as a carbon source (hence, that is why bioremediation is often a good choice for organic contaminants). In addition, the chemical contaminant is also a source of electrons that the microbe needs to extract for energy. That is, the chemical is the microbe's oxygen acceptor during respiration. The microbe produces enzymes that hasten the process of breaking chemical bonds and transferring electrons from the contaminant to an electron acceptor (oxygen for aerobic respiration, and metals [e.g., iron and manganese] and inorganic chemicals [e.g., nitrates and sulfates] for anaerobic respiration). b. A second, less effective process is known as "secondary utilization." Microbes can transform chemical contaminants although the reaction provides no direct benefit to the microbial cell. Probably the most common, at least bestunderstood secondary utilization process is co-metabolism, wherein the microbes break down chemicals coincidentally with enzymes that they normally synthesize for metabolism or detoxification. A case is the methane-oxidizing bacteria that happen to degrade chlorinated hydrocarbons, benzene, phenol, and toluene by producing enzymes needed to transfer electrons to methane (i.e., the bacterium's normal electron acceptor). The normal methane oxidation enzymes auspiciously degrade the chemical contaminants, even though the chemicals cannot serve as the primary food source for the bacteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Exponential phase:</head><p>The cell mass and the number of cells are growing exponentially by binary fission. 4. Declining growth phase: Cell mass and numbers of cells continue to grow, but at a decreasing rate. This is usually due to depletion of the food and electron source (i.e., the contaminant, hopefully). Other limiting factors could also come into play, such as some of the newly generated chemicals ("degradates") inhibiting the growth of the microbes due to their toxicity. 5. Stationary phase: Cell decay is about equal to cell propagation during this time. 6. Decay: Cell decay now exceeds cell propagation. 7. Exponential death phase: Cells are dying exponentially as cells no longer grow or propagate. Under optimal conditions, this indicates successful bioremediation because the food source (toxic organics) is entirely used up.</p><p>The cycle will repeat if the microbes are again introduced to another slug of pollutants. Recall that happens ex situ, for example a new batch of contaminated soil is introduced in the reactor, and in situ, with biostimulation (e.g., when the new mixes of nutrients are injected) or bioaugmentation (e.g., microbes are sent to another part of the aquifer).</p><p>The increase in microbial biomass in a bulk solution is inversely proportional to the decrease in food, if the food source is constant. It is also directly proportional to the biodegradation half-life of the contaminant. For example, if 400 kg of a chemical contaminant in a water solution must be treating using a reactor system, we can estimate the time it will take to degrade 375 kg of the contaminant, if we know the rate constant and the reaction order. In this instance, the contaminant's rate constant is 10 À4 sec À1 and the reaction is first order.</p><p>By definition, the half-life (T 1/2 ) is the time it takes for the concentration of a reactant to reach one-half of its initial value, so in this case it takes four half-lives</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">À x e x 2 e x 4 e x 8 e x 16 Á</formula><p>to reach 25 kg. The equation for a first-order half-life (T 1/2 ) is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">T 1=2 ¼ lnð2ÞðkÞ À1 (7.11)</formula><p>in which k ¼ the rate constant.</p><p>Because the natural log of 2 is 0.693 and k ¼ 10 À4 the half-life of the chemical is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">T 1=2 ¼ ð0:693Þ À 10 À4 Á À1 ¼ 6930 sec</formula><p>Thus, the time it takes to reach 25 kg of remaining chemical, i.e., four half-lives, can be calculated:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">4 À T 1=2 Á ¼ 27720 sec or 7:7 hours</formula><p>to destroy 375 kg of the initial 400 kg of the contaminant. We still have a large amount of chemical (25 kg) to be treated. Assume that we need to reach 1 kg of the remaining chemical (i.e., degrade 24 kg). This will take an additional five T 1/2 , so if the first-order reaction continues it will take 34,650 s or 9.6 h for remaining mass of the contaminant in the solution to fall below 1 kg. It is important to note that reaction rates can be affected by concentrations and other factors (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.13). For example, when much reactant is available the reaction is not rate limited by concentration, but as the mass drops in the solution, the microbes may transition to nonexponential growth.</p><p>Given the assumptions, the total time needed to go from 400 kg to &lt;1 kg of the waste is more than 17 h. However, an engineer would likely want to achieve the higher removal rates found at higher mass (and concentrations). If this were not the only waste source for the chemical contaminant, it would be better to keep adding wastes to the reactor. In other words, treating the first half-life (400e200 kg) continuously takes 2 h to destroy 200 kg of the contaminant. Conversely, treating at the ninth half-life (about 1.6e0.8 kg), it takes 2 h to destroy 0.8 kg of the contaminant <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Degradation rates are often expressed empirically. For example, an enzyme-catalyzed reaction to degrade organic compounds follows the MichaeliseMenton equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">dC dt ¼ À V max C K m þ C (7.12)</formula><p>in which C ¼ concentration of the compound in soil; t ¼ time; V max ¼ maximum reaction rate; and K m ¼ the Michaelis constant.</p><p>V max is the reaction rate threshold above which the concentration of the compound is not a rate-limiting factor. It includes both extracellular enzymatic activities in the soil and intracellular microbial activities in the soil. Thus, it changes with the concentrations of enzymes. K m is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is one-half of the V max <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>With decreasing concentrations of an organic substrate, the rate of microbial biomass growth also decreases. This is expressed by the empirically derived Monod equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">m ¼ m max S K s þ S (7.13)</formula><p>in which m ¼ the specific growth rate of the microbe, m max ¼ maximum specific growth rate, and K s ¼ the Monod growth rate coefficient representing the substrate concentration at which the growth rate is half the maximum rate (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.11).</p><p>The m max is reached at the higher ranges of substrate concentrations. K s is an expression of the affinity of the microbe for a nutrient, i.e., as K s decreases the more affinity that microbe has for that particular nutrient (as expressed by the concomitantly increasing m). Thus, at low substrate concentrations, the reaction rates are often assumed to be first order with respect to both microbial population biomass and substrate concentration. Microbiologists and other biologists describe first-order processes using a half-life, whereas engineers commonly describe first-order processes using a first-order rate constant. This is because the rate of change relates directly to the constant. Also, in the presence of simultaneously operating first-order processes, such as biodegradation, the rate constant for the combined effect can be calculated as the sum of the individual rate constants. Transport and fate models can be evaluated using this property, because numerous processes can be combined into a single calibration parameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.15 compares first-order rate constants to the respective half-life units.</p><p>There is some concern that the Monod equation is based solely on observational information and has not been fully explained theoretically, so there continues to be research to explain the mechanics underlying these empirical relationships between microbial populations and substrate degradation.</p><p>The biodegradable, organic feedstock coming into an aerobic digester is oxidized to CO 2 and water. The exiting material usually also includes untreated or converted biomass and nitrogenous compounds. To increase the rates of anaerobic digestion over those in nature, the surface area of biofilm must be greatly increased, so as to enhance O exchange in fixed-film processes (see Discussion Box: Biodynamic Films), especially trickling filters, and returning some of the activated sludge to the digester vessel.</p><p>Biodegradation by anaerobic digestion is initiated when microbes hydrolyze the organic matter entering the bioreactor. The rate of hydrolysis depends on the reactor conditions (retention time, mixing, temperature, pressure) and the complexity of the organic material. The feedstock can be mixtures containing simple carbohydrates to very lipophilic, organic compounds (e.g., polymers). Acidogenic microbes convert the feedstock sugars and amino acids into carbon dioxide, molecular hydrogen (H ), ammonia (NH 3 ), and organic compounds with the carboxyl functional group (ReCOOH), i.e., the organic acids. Next acetogenic microorganisms convert the organic acids into simpler acids, e.g., acetic acid, with the H 2 and NH 3 remaining in the mixture. The final step is methanogenesis, also known as biomethanation. This consists of methanogenic bacteria converting this mixture into methane (CH 4 ) and CO 2 . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOSORPTION</head><p>Microbial degradation is not usually the method of choice to treat media contaminated with heavy metals. Usually, heavy metal treatment involves changing oxidation states to alter toxicity and mobility. However, there is also growing use and potential for biosorbents to remove metallic wastes. Biosorption is bioenergetically neutral, because metabolism is not involved. Various biosorbents have been used, e.g., eggshells, bone, peat, and compost. The rate and amount of biosorption are limited by a chemicalesubstrate kinetic equilibrium and by the biosorbent's surface area and composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[74]</ref>. This also applies to bacterial biosorption, mainly at and across the bacterium's biofilm of living bacteria, but dead cells have also been shown to sorb metals. For example, living Bacillus sphaericus biosorbs arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr). Dead B. sphaericus also biosorbs Cr. In a laboratory study <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[74]</ref>, living cells of the two tolerant B. sphaericus strains sorbed 6 to 47% of Co, Hg, Fe, and As. Living and dead cells of B. sphaericus OT4b31 sorbed 25 and 44.5% of Cr, respectively, and B. sphaericus IV(4)10 biosorbed 32 and 45%, respectively. The differences are attributed to the absence of an active metabolism in dead cells, as well as to environmental factors (e.g., pH variation) and possibly to S-layer proteins' ability to entrap metallic ions. The S-layer is a monomolecular layer of identical proteins and glycoproteins of the bacterial cell envelope that can account for as much as 15% of the bacterium's protein content <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[65]</ref>. This attraction can occur in both living and dead cells.</p><p>Thus, biotechnology merges with materials science in search of effective substrates for biosorption of contaminants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Box</head><p>Biochemodynamic Films A key limitation of biodegradation and other biological processes is whether an organism comes into contact with the substance that needs to be transformed and degraded. This takes place in the biofilm, which is a thin layer of biota that lives on substrate, such as soil particles, unconsolidated materials like sand and gravel in aquifers, or media in bioreactors and other biological waste treatment systems. A biofilm consists of microorganisms, e.g., alga, fungi, bacteria, their byproducts, and waste, water, and air (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.16).</p><p>During degradation, the mass or concentration of a chemical substance decreases with respect to time. This is the case for any type of degradation, whether abiotic chemical degradation or biodegradation. All other factors being equal in biodegradation and many abiotic chemical decay processes, the concentration dependence reflects a first-order reaction sequence. That is, the concentration of the product increases in proportion to the decrease in concentration of the single substance undergoing change:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">dC A dt ¼ kC A (7.14)</formula><p>in which C A is the concentration of reactant A, t is time, and k is the first-order reaction constant, i.e., the fraction of A degrading per unit of time. The reactions may occur in various combinations of physical phases and environmental compartments 2 . Reactions that take place in a single phase are known as homogeneous reactions. Film is the area between two different phases (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.17).</p><p>Biofilms follow the same biochemodynamic principles of any film. The movement and change of substances (e.g., nutrients and contaminants) across phase boundaries and compartmental interfaces can be envisioned as the separation and joining of films. The two-film model depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.18 demonstrates the relationship between the liquid 2. The environmental literature is not completely consistent in its use of the term "phase." The term may be interpreted to mean exactly what physical chemists have defined, i.e., phase is the distinct state of matter in a physical system. Such matter is identical in chemical composition and physical state and separated from other material by the phase boundary as represented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.12. However, phase may be more akin in environmental contexts to "fractional solubility," meaning that a substance can be found in varying amounts in different solvents. One of the most common examples of fractional solubility is demarcation between the concentration of a contaminant in the "organic phase" and "aqueous phase" as represented by the octanolewater partition coefficient (K ow ), discussed in this chapter. Another less commonly applied connotation of environmental phases is its synonymous usage with environmental "media" or "compartments." for example, one may hear environmental engineers discussing the transport of a contaminant from the water phase to the air phase, or the soil phase to the water and air phases. Context, in fact, is important in many environmental discussions, and reading in context is often the only way to know what a publication means. Because environmental science, engineering, and technology draws from so many fields, numerous terms (e.g., particle) have various meanings which can only be understood within the context of the specific discussion. Furthermore, even within the environmental disciplines, uses of terms like phase will vary. For example, air experts may use the physical chemists' definition when discussing phase distributions within a stack gas, but may use the solubility fractionation definition when discussing the transformation and transport of a pollutant between a raindrop and the air (i.e., air-water partitioning). Likewise, soil and water scientists may apply the physicochemical definition of phases when in the laboratory (e.g., measuring the amount of a liquid or solid-phase analyte volatilizing to the gas phase from the gas chromatograph's column and carried as a gas to the detector). However, in the field they may refer to phase distribution as the movements among soil, water, and air compartments.</p><p>and gas phases at a microscopic scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The model is designed under the assumption that the gas and liquid phases are in turbulent contact with each other, but segregated by an interface, in which contaminants may cross in either direction. Each film is a mass transfer zone that comprises a small volume of the gas and liquid phases on either side of the interface.</p><p>The flow in the mass transfer zones is assumed to be laminar and the flow in the bulk liquid and gas regions is generally turbulent. Assuming complete mixing in the bulk phases and equilibrium between the substance's molecule and the molecules of the interface, for a substance to move from the gas phase to the liquid phase, it must first migrate from the bulk gas phase into the gas film, then diffuse through the gas film (a function of the gas' partial pressure), before crossing the interface. After it crosses the interface, the substances must diffuse through the liquid film and mix into the bulk liquid (a function of the substance's concentration in the liquid). This means that all resistance to movement occurs as the substance's molecules diffuse through the films to reach the interface region. That is why the two-film theory is also referred to as the double resistance theory. In liquid-to-gas transport, the concentration in the liquid changes as it moves from the bulk liquid phase through the liquid film. The rate of mass transfer from one phase to the other then equals the product of the amount of the substance being transferred times the resistance the substance receives when moving through the films. Thus, the difference in a contaminant's partial pressure in the bulk gas and at the interface is known as the gasside impedance, whereas the difference in a contaminant's concentration in the bulk liquid and at the interface is known as the liquid-side impedance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Therefore, chemical reactions can occur in the bulk liquid, in the bulk solid, but also within the film. The reaction rates and characteristics depend on in which phase or mass transfer zone (film) the contaminant or nutrient is found.</p><p>The film models are also important for the transport of contaminants across various types of surfaces. For example, the biofilm behaves similarly to the two-film exchanges in tissue, such as between water and lipid diffusion between blood and gastrointestinal tracts in animals (see <ref type="bibr">Figure 7.19)</ref>.</p><p>Biofilms are important considerations in any biological treatment system. For example, the traditional design of a trickling filter system illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.20 includes a bed of fist-sized rocks, enclosed in a rectangular or cylindrical structure, through which is passed the waste of concern. Biofilms are selected from laboratory studies and encouraged to grow on the rocks; as the liquid waste moves downward with gravity through the bed the microorganisms composing the biofilm are able to come into contact with the organic contaminant/food source and ideally metabolize the waste into relatively harmless CO 2 þ H 2 O þ microorganisms (þenergy?). Oxygen is supplied by blowers from the bottom of the reactor and passes upward through the bed. The treated waste that moves downward through the bed subsequently enters a quiescent tank in which the microorganisms and their biofilms are sloughed off of the media and then settled, collected, and ultimately disposed.</p><p>Trickling filters are actually considered mixed treatment systems because aerobic bacteria grow in the upper, higher oxygen layers of the media, whereas anaerobes grow in the lower, more reduced regions lower in the system. No matter the type of microbe, however, their only means of contact with the waste to be treated is the biofilm.</p><p>The same principles hold for microbial degradation in soil and in an aquifer (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.21). As the contaminated water passes through the unsaturated zone, the microbes depend on the biofilm to come into contact with the food (the organic matter in the passing water). In fact, the zone immediately above the water table is the capillary fringe. Regardless of how densely soil particles are arranged, void spaces (i.e., pore spaces) will exist between the particles. By definition, the pore spaces below the water table are filled exclusively with water. However, above the water table, the spaces are filled with a mixture of air and water, so microbial contact depends on the biofilm around the individual particles. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.21 illustrates that the spaces between unconsolidated material (e.g., gravel, sand, or clay) are interconnected, and behave like small conduits or pipes in their ability to distribute water. Depending on the grain size and density of packing, the conduits will vary in diameter, ranging from large pores (i.e., macropores), to medium pore sizes (i.e., mesopores), to extremely small pores (i.e., micropores).</p><p>Water Biofilm transport is a limiting factor in biodegradation. Their properties can also interact with other substrate and media properties. These relationships can be put to use by the bioengineer. Lipophilic and hydrophobic compounds can be particularly difficult to treat. However, if the concentration gradient of these compounds is greater than that of the freewater phase, the partitioning rate in the biofilm can be enhanced for those microbes that produce hair-like structures (fimbriae) that enhance the transport of these compounds toward the cells. The combination of these appendages and the biofilm are conducive to biodegradation. The question remains whether genetically enhancing microbial appendages and other properties to improve contact with contaminants carries its own risks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AEROBIC BIODEGRADATION</head><p>Theoretically, if a substance is completely organic in structure, it should be able to be completely destroyed using principles based in microbiology with the engineering inputs and outputs summarized as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Hydrocarbons þ O 2 þ microorganisms ðþ energyÞ / CO 2 þ H 2 O þ microorganisms ðþenergy?Þ</formula><p>Organic wastes are mixed with oxygen and aerobic microorganisms, sometimes with an added energy source in the form of added nutrition for the microorganisms, and in seconds, hours, or possibly days the byproducts of gaseous carbon dioxide and water are produced which exit the top of the reaction vessel.

All rely on a population(s) of microorganisms to metabolize an organic contaminant ideally into the harmless byproducts of CO 2 þ H 2 O (þenergy?). In all of the systems the microorganisms must either be initially cultured in the laboratory to be able to metabolize the specific organic waste of concern, or target populations of microorganisms in the system must be given sufficient time, days, weeks, possible even years, to evolve to the point to which the cumbersome food, that is the contaminant, is digestible by the microorganisms. However, biotechnology, including rDNA manipulation, has sped up these acclimation processes for certain microbial populations.</p><p>During all treatment processes the input waste must be monitored and possibly controlled to maintain environmental conditions that do not upset or destroy the microorganisms in the system. These monitoring and control requirements for each of the systems include but are not limited to: presence of additional food sources and/or nutrients, possibly in the form of a secondary carbon source for the microorganisms; and, l changes in the characteristics of the input hazardous waste, including hydrocarbon availability and chemicals that may be toxic to the microorganisms, possibly including holding tanks to homogenize the waste prior to exposure to the microorganisms.</p><p>The populations of microorganisms must be matched to the particular contaminant of concern. The engineer must plan for and undertake extensive and continual monitoring and fine-tuning of each microbiological processing system during its complete operation.</p><p>The advantages of the biotreatment systems include: (1) the potential for energy recovery; (2) volume reduction of the hazardous waste; (3) detoxification as selected molecules are reformulated; (4) the basic scientific principles, engineering designs, and technologies are well understood from a wide range of other applications including municipal wastewater treatment at facilities around the world; (5) application to most organic contaminants that as a group compose a large percentage of the total hazardous waste generated worldwide; (6) the possibility to scale the technologies to handle a single gallon/pound (liter/kilogram) of waste per day or millions of gallons/pounds (liters/kilograms) of waste per day; and <ref type="formula">7</ref>land areas that could be small relative to such other hazardous waste management facilities as landfills.</p><p>The disadvantages of these systems include: (1) the operation of the equipment requires very skilled operators and is more costly as input contaminant characteristics change over time and correctional controls become necessary; and (2) ultimate disposal of the waste microorganisms is necessary and particularly troublesome and costly if heavy metals and/or chlorinated compounds are found during the expensive monitoring activities.</p><p>Given these underlying principles of biotreatment systems, four general guidelines are suggested whenever such systems are considered as a potential solution to any contaminant problem:</p><p>1. only liquid organic contaminants are true candidates; 2. chlorine-containing organic materials deserve special consideration if in fact they are to be biotreated at all, and special testing is required to match microbial communities to the chlorinated wastes, realizing that useful microbes may not be identifiable and even if they are the reactions may take years to complete; 3. hazardous waste containing heavy metals generally should not be bioprocessed (however, biosorption and other removal methods can be employed to remove and change oxidation states of heavy metal compounds); and 4. residual masses of microorganisms must be monitored for chemical constituents, and each residual must be addressed as appropriate so the entire bioprocessing system operates within the requirements of the local, state, and federal environmental regulators.</p><p>The bottom line is that each application of biotechnology must be tailored to the specific characteristics of the contaminant under consideration, including the quantity of waste to be processed over the planning period as well as the physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics of the waste also over the entire planning period of the project. Laboratory tests matching a given waste to a given bioprocessor must be conducted prior to the design and siting of any biotechnology system.</p><p>Variations on three types of bioprocessors are available to the engineer: (1) trickling filter;</p><p>(2) activated sludge; and, (3) aeration lagoons. As a group these three types of treatment systems represent a broad range of opportunities available to engineers searching for methods to control the risks associated with contaminants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRICKLING FILTER</head><p>The trickling filter is a time-tested, proven bioreactor system that has been widely used to treat municipal wastes and hazardous wastes. As mentioned, the classic design of a trickling-filter system illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.20 includes packed media (often rocks, but there are numerous materials onto which microbes can adhere) through which liquids contacting the organic matter move by gravity after being sprayed onto the surface. The large amount of surface area provides ample contact between microbial populations and the liquid waste. That is, the microbes' biofilm comes into contact with an organic contaminant/food source. The concomitant microbial growth and metabolism result in degradation of the organic compounds, i.e., CO 2 þ H 2 O þ microorganisms (þenergy?).</p><p>Media bed depths can vary, but traditional trickling-filter beds have been between about 1 and 3 m. The media size ranges from about 25 to 60 mm in diameter (e.g., round gravel). However, various shapes and materials (e.g., polyvinyl chloride) have been used successfully. Waste is applied in a circular rotating manner to prevent pooling or uneven deposits. The interstices and openings between the media allow for air penetration throughout the system. In addition, air can be supplied by blowers from the bottom of the reactor, migrating upward through the bed. This makes most of the trickling filter aerobic. The treated waste that moves downward through the bed subsequently enters a quiescent tank in which the microorganisms that are sloughed off of the rocks are settled, collected, and ultimately disposed of. Even though much of the surface area is aerobic, trickling filters are actually considered to be mixed treatment systems because aerobic bacteria grow in the upper, higher oxygen layers of the media, whereas anaerobes grow in the lower, more reduced regions lower in the system, particularly if air is not pumped upward.</p><p>For particularly strong and recalcitrant compounds, and when the organic loading increases with time, a multiple-filter system will be needed. For example, the first filter in a series may accept a high loading rate of organic matter, followed by subsequent filters in which their media come into contact with the partially treated waste liquids that broke through the first filter. Indeed, the process can be reversed so that the overloaded filter can recover from the loading (i.e., the second filter becomes the first filter, so that the original, first filter will receive less organic loading).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ACTIVATED SLUDGE</head><p>The key to the activated sludge system (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.22) is the enhancement of biodegradation due to greater numbers of microbes so that they can metabolize the contaminant/food source. This is accomplished by recycling the microbially rich biosolids (i.e., sludge), which enables this bioprocessing system to evolve over time as the microorganisms adapt to the changing characteristics of the influent. This evolution increases the potential for the microorganisms to be more efficient at metabolizing the waste stream of concern.</p><p>Liquid organic mixtures are injected with a mass of microorganisms into the bioreactor. Oxygen is supplied through the aeration basin as the microorganisms come in contact, sorb, and metabolize the waste ideally into CO 2 þ H 2 O þ microorganisms (þenergy?). The heavy, satisfied, microorganisms then flow into a quiescent tank within which the microorganisms that are settled with gravity are collected, and ultimately disposed. Depending on the current operating conditions of the processor some or many of the settled and now active microorganisms are returned to the aeration basin in which they are given another opportunity to metabolize the organic compounds in the tank. Liquid effluent from the activated sludge system may require additional microbiological and/or chemical processing prior to release into a receiving stream or city sewer system.</p><p>The activated sludge process in theory and in practice is a sequence of three distinct physical, chemical, and biological steps:</p><p>Sorption. The microorganisms come in contact with the food source, the organic material in the contaminant, and the food either is adsorbed to the cell walls or adsorbed through the cell walls of the microorganisms. In either case the food is now directly available to the individual microorganisms. In a correctly operated facility this sorption phase generally takes about 30 min. Growth. The microorganisms metabolize the food and biochemically break down, or destroy, the hazardous organic molecules. This growth phase, during which individual organisms grow and multiply, may take hours or possibly days for complete metabolism of the hazardous constituents in the waste. Thus, the design of the activated sludge system must include a basin with a detention time adequate for the correct amount of growth to take place. Settling. Solid (the microorganisms)eliquid (the liquid remaining from the process) separation is achieved in a settling basin in which the heavy and satisfied microorganisms sink to the bottom with gravity. A critical design consideration of the activated-sludge system is the loading to the aeration basin. Loading is defined as the food (F) to microorganism (M) ratio (F:M) at the start of the aeration process. Loading requires a balance between sufficient food available for the microbial population that is returned from the settling basin to the aeration tank. The operating engineer must fine-tune the F:M ratio by adjusting the number of returned microorganisms. This balancing act between the amount of food and the numbers of microorganisms is summarized in two extreme examples suggesting ranges of F:M ratios, aeration times, and treatment efficiencies: Variations of the classic activated-sludge system summarized above exist to help process very specific and difficult-totreat contaminants. These variations in the design and operation of such facilities include:</p><p>Tapered aeration <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 7</ref>.23): The oxygen that is supplied to the aeration basin is in greater amounts at the input end of the basin and in lesser amounts at the output end of the basin, with the goal of supplying more oxygen where it may be needed the most to address a specific hazardous waste problem.</p><p>Step aeration <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 7</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AERATION PONDS AND LAGOONS</head><p>Ponds like the one illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.26(A) treat liquid and dissolved contaminants over the long term, months to years. Persistent organic molecules, those not readily degraded in trickling-filter or activated-sludge systems, are potentially broken by certain microbes into CO 2 þ H 2 O þ microorganisms (þenergy ?) if given enough time. The ponds are open to the weather and ideally oxygen is supplied directly to the microorganisms from the atmosphere. Design decisions based on laboratory experiments and pilot studies include:</p><p>Design: Pond size: 0.5e20 acres Design: Pond depth: 1 foot to 30 feet Design: Detention time: days to months to possibly years Operation: In series with other treatment systems, other ponds, or not Operation: The flow to the pond is either continuous or intermittent Operation: The supply of additional oxygen to the system through blowers and diffusers may be required (i.e., active systems).</p><p>A similar aerobic system is slurry-phase lagoon activation, in which air and contaminated soil are made to come into contact with one another to promote biodegradation. Such a system can be used to treat an entire batch of sludge in single  operation. These are usually less than two acres, with geometry and depth dependent upon the type of liner material, as well as the sludge characteristics and thickness. Larger systems require sectioning off into smaller lagoon compartments (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.26(B)). Total solids content ranges from 5 to 20% <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Slurry systems are also used ex situ in tanks in which higher degradation rates and greater engineering controls are needed (e.g., to treat soils and other media contaminated with very toxic and/or particularly recalcitrant organic contaminants). These stirred-tank bioreactors can receive sequenced batches or continuously fed sludge.</p><p>Another standing-water biological treatment system ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.26(C)) is the engineered and constructed wetland, which operates as a type of biofilter. Wetlands naturally contain diverse and abundant microbial populations. They combine these with growth, nutrient extraction, photosynthesis, and ion exchange processes of plants (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.27 and the Phytoremediation section later in this chapter). For example, gasoline-contaminated groundwater has been bioremediated using a radial-flow constructed wetland system in Casper, Wyoming. In this system, subsurface beds of crushed concrete reclaimed from a closed refinery were insulated with 6-inch layers of mulch. Above these layers bulrushes, switchgrass, and cordgrass were planted in separate sections of the wetland system. About 700,000 gallons of water are passively treated each day, with large reductions in benzene and other hydrocarbons. The rock/mulch insulated layers allow biological activity to continue throughout the year, even in the cold Wyoming winters. The passive system is also cost-effective All three systems make use of microbes, nutrients, and oxygen, but the active system increases the contact between the microbes and organic matter by mechanically mixing the sludge layer (which contains the organic contaminants to be degraded) with the water in the lagoon. The engineered wetland also incorporates plant processes in the degradation process. Source: Refs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. (estimated construction costs were about 20% of a pump and treat system that can meet similar criteria, e.g., air stripping and catalytic oxidation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The crucial engineering concerns in the design and operation of ponds and other biotreatment facilities are the identification and maintenance of microbial populations that metabolize the specific contaminant of concern. Once selected, the conditions most favorable to the microbial populations can be determined and controlled.</p><p>The fluid dynamics and biological principles of the slurry-phase lagoon <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 7</ref>.26(B)) and the engineered wetland ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.26(C) and 7.27) can be put to use to treat air pollutants in a simple biofilter <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 7.28)</ref>. However, polluted air rather than water is pumped into the system and mixed with water and pushed into the bottom of a 1-m deep trench covered with unconsolidated material (soil or compost). The saturated air and water containing the organic contaminants move into the gravel and come into contact with microbial biofilm. The vapor pressure allows the more volatile compounds to move first through the media, but with time less volatile compound vapor will percolate through the unconsolidated material. During percolation, the air contacts the biofilm of microbes sorbed to the particles, which degrade the organic contaminants. A more intricate version is the packed-bed biological control system <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 7</ref>.29) to treat volatile compounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TREATMENT OPTIMIZATION</head><p>In situ treatment literally means that the waste being treated is not moved, but treated where it is found. However, a number of treatment methods require that the waste, e.g., contaminated soil or water, be removed but not moved to a treatment facility. That is, they are on-site ex situ treatment approaches.  Excavated soil can be treated using composting, in which aerobes break down organic matter. In the process, toxic compounds can also be degraded into simpler organic matter. A biophile is a more highly controlled type of composting, which is an aboveground form of biostimulation, i.e., humidity, temperature, nutrient content, oxygen levels, and pH are controlled so that microbial growth and metabolism is optimally matched to organic matter. Bioreactors are even more highly controlled, because the treated matter is held in a vessel. The activated-sludge systems discussed earlier in this chapter are examples of aerobic bioreactors.</p><p>A biowall is a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) that treats groundwater by combining passive chemicals and a biological treatment zone. The groundwater flows through the barrier by its natural hydraulic gradient (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 3.24)</ref>. The "bio" aspect of the biowall is when the reactive media consists of organic material on which microbes grow (e.g., wood chips or mulch). Thus, both physical removal (e.g., sorption) and bioremediation are at work in collecting and degrading the organic contaminants in the groundwater. Actually, like the trickling filter, there are both aerobic and anaerobic zones in the biowall, with their own degradation pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Biowall dimensions range from 3 to 36 feet deep, matched to the contaminant plume. Biostimulation is needed periodically, as the wall's nutrient and organic matter content become degraded.</p><p>Costs and safety factors help to determine which method is best suited to the wastes at hand. Expansive, difficult to reach soil and water may require in situ processes. Soil that can be effectively excavated or water that can be pumped efficiently may be conducive to ex situ methods. But soils and water that are difficult or unsafe to transport may be best treated on site. Wastes that meet design criteria of off-site, large-scale treatment facilities may be good candidates for transport, avoiding the need to build a bioreactor on site.</p><p>In addition, bioremediation must adhere to best practices. Recently, these have included the need for "green cleanup" processes. That is, they must [23]: Green remediation considers all environmental effects of a cleanup to select the option that provides the greatest net environmental benefits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADATION</head><p>Concentrated wastes may require anaerobic treatment, in which molecular oxygen is absent, or facultative treatment (in which bacteria grow with or without molecular oxygen) to degrade the complex contaminant molecules into simpler compounds.</p><p>In this process, anaerobic bacteria grow by using electron acceptor sources other than molecular oxygen (O 2 ). Anaerobic systems can be used to treat industrial wastes. Other systems (e.g., lagoons) encourage the growth of facultative bacteria, those that can grow in the presence or absence of O 2 . Facultative systems can remove toxic wastes by creating a balance between bacteria and algae by modulating aerobic and anaerobic conditions to enhance chemical uptake. The anaerobic and facultative processes are enhanced in a constructed wastewater treatment system, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.30. These processes can also take place in other systems, like landfills.</p><p>Often, anaerobic and aerobic processes take place in different parts of the same system, as mentioned in the tricklingfilter discussions. On the negative side, one of the challenges of an aerobic system is that the aerobes stay in contact with molecular oxygen. If the reactor's oxygen level drops or if the tank is not completely mixed, pockets of anoxic and reduced conditions can lead to localized anaerobic conditions within the bioreactor. This is unacceptable if the biological reactions depend solely on oxygen as the electron acceptor. In fact, the foul smells from wastewater treatment facilities can usually be attributed to some part of the plant or the receiving water "going anaerobic," meaning that sulfur compounds are being reduced to odoriferous forms, e.g., hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans. However, anaerobic bacteria can be very useful in breaking down recalcitrant organic compounds.</p><p>Anaerobic degradation consists of a series of steps whereby polysaccharides, proteins, fats, and other complex polymeric materials are hydrolyzed by the microbes. These microbial reactions, catalyzed by enzymes, generate products with greater aqueous solubility. The new compounds are secreted by the microorganisms into the biofilm in which they can be transported, including diffusion across cellular membranes.</p><p>Ultimately, if the anaerobic biodegradation is successful, the production and ensuing escape of methane indicates that the organic material has been stabilized and degraded. The design of anaerobic systems needs to ensure that the retention time of the solids is sufficient for contact and reaction by the microbes with the substrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. For example, if the input of relatively easily degradable organics is too rapid, this can lead to acidic and toxic conditions, with the buildup of organic acids, which can foul the reactor by inhibiting methanogenesis (i.e., instead of reaching the desired methanedwater products, the system is stuck in the acid production steps).</p><p>Acclimation of the microorganisms to a substrate can take several weeks. The biochemodynamics of the bioreactor affect anaerobic digestion rates, including temperature, pH, and concentration of toxic substances. The conventional anaerobic treatment process consists of a reactor containing waste and biosolids (sludge containing large microbial populations). As in the aerobic activated-sludge systems, these biosolids can be added continuously or in semi-batches, whereupon they are mixed in the bioreactor. In theory, the anaerobic digester is a once-through, completely mixed, reactor. If so, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) equals the solids retention time (SRT). This means that efficiency depends directly on the contact with the biosolids, i.e., the SRT. However, HRT and SRT can be decoupled for increased FIGURE 7.30 Anaerobic treatment system. Note in the photo the lighter substances that have migrated to the surface. These may be fats that have been separated physically during the treatment process, or bubbles from gases, such as methane, that are produced when the anaerobes degrade the wastes. Note that although this is an anoxic chamber, a thin film layer at the surface will be aerobic because it is in contact with the atmosphere. Photo courtesy of Vallero DJ. bioremediation efficiency. For example, an anaerobic upflow filter (AF) can substantially improve anaerobic degradation volumes and rates, because the filter can catch and sustain high concentrations of biosolids. By holding the solids, attenuated SRTs allow for much larger throughput, which is needed to degrade low-strength organic wastes under feasible environmental conditions (e.g., ambient temperatures and barometric pressures). A bed upflow reactor is another anaerobic system, but depends on the sorption of biomass on the surfaces of media. This is done by passing liquid solutions of the organic compounds to be treated upward through a bed of sand-sized particles at a velocity necessary to fluidize and partially expand the sand bed. More recently, the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket process (UASB) takes advantage of the inherent properties of flocculation and settling of anaerobic sludge, allowing for much higher HRT loadings and partitioning of gases (e.g., H 2 , CH 4 ) from the sludge solids. The UASB is based on two biochemodynamic processes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.29): separation of solids and gases from the liquid and degradation of biodegradable organic matter. If heavy mechanical agitation is avoided, unlike the other aerobic digesters, a separate settler with a biosolids return pump is not needed, so reactor volume can flow consistently through the systems. Unlike the fluidized-bed reactor, high-rate effluent recirculation and pumping are also eliminated. The biogas production enhances continuous contact between substrate and anaerobes. The UASB reactor, under optimal conditions, can be assumed to be a completely mixed reactor. The biosolids' contact with the incoming organic liquids is enhanced by the agitation caused by the release of gases from the biodegradation, along with an inlet that evenly distributes incoming materials in the lower level of the reactor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MULTIMEDIA-MULTIPHASE BIOREMEDIATION</head><p>Waste streams containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may be treated with combinations of phases, i.e., solid media, gas, and liquid flow in complete biological systems. These systems are classified as three basic types <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">l Biofilters l Biotrickling filters l Bioscrubbers</formula><p>Biofilms of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) are grown on porous media in biofilters and biotrickling systems. The air or other gas containing the VOCs is passed through the biologically active media, in which the microbes break down the compounds to simpler compounds, eventually to carbon dioxide (if aerobic), methane (if anaerobic), and water. The major difference between biofiltration and trickling systems is how the liquid interfaces with the microbes. The liquid phase is stationary in a biofilter (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.31), but liquids move through the porous media of a biotrickling system (i.e., the liquid "trickles").</p><p>A particularly novel biotechnological method in biofiltration (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.32) uses compost as the porous media. Compost contains numerous species of beneficial microbes that are already acclimated to organic wastes. Industrial compost biofilters have achieved removal rates at the 99% level. Biofilters are also the most common method for removing VOCs and odorous compounds from air streams.</p><p>In addition to a wide assortment of volatile chain and aromatic organic compounds, biological systems have successfully removed vapor phase inorganics, such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and other sulfides including carbon disulfide, as well as mercaptans. The operational key is the biofilm. The gas must interface with the film. In fact, this interface may also occur without a liquid phase (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.15). According to Henry's law, the compounds partition from the gas phase (in the carrier gas or air stream) to the liquid phase (biofilm). Compost has been a particularly useful medium in providing this partitioning.</p><p>The bioscrubber is a two-unit setup. The first unit is an adsorption unit. This unit may be a spray tower, bubbling scrubber, or packed column. After this unit, the air stream enters a bioreactor with a design quite similar to an activated sludge system in a wastewater treatment facility. Bioscrubbers are much less common in the United States than biofiltration systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>All three types of biological systems have relatively low operating costs because they are operated near ambient temperature and pressure conditions. Power needs are generally for air movement and pressure drops are low (&lt;10 cmH 2 O m À1 packed bed). Other costs include amendments (e.g., nutrients) and humidification. Another advantage is the usual small amount of toxic byproducts, as well as low rates of emissions of greenhouse gases (oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide), compared to thermal systems.</p><p>Success is highly dependent on the degradability of the compounds present in the air stream, their fugacity and solubility needed to enter the biofilm (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7.</ref>15), and pollutant loading rates. Care must be taken in monitoring the porous media for incomplete biodegradation, the presence of substances that may be toxic to the microbes, excessive concentrations of organic acids and alcohols, and pH. The system should also be checked for shock and the presence of dust, grease, or other substances that may clog the pore spaces of the media <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHYTOREMEDIATION</head><p>As mentioned in Chapter 1, biotechnology in its broadest sense goes beyond microbial organisms in environmental applications. Plants are also used in remedying environmental problems. Phytoremediation is bioremediation by way of plant life. It is usually in situ and is almost always dependent on available air (i.e., it is almost exclusively an aerobic process).</p><p>Phytoremediation takes advantage of plants' absorption of CO 2 for photosynthesis, the process whereby plants convert solar energy into biomass and release O 2 as a byproduct. Thus, the essential oxygen is actually the waste product of photosynthesis and is derived from carbon-based compounds. Respiration generates carbon dioxide as a waste product of oxidation that takes place in organisms, so there is a balance between green plants' uptake of CO 2 and release of O 2 in photosynthesis and the uptake of O 2 and release of CO 2 in respiration by animals, microbes and other organisms.</p><p>Phytoremediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> can be used for a wide range of contaminants and soil types. It is frequently used to remediate metal-contaminated sites (e.g., nickel and its compounds). Phytoextraction (or phytoaccumulation) involves roots in the uptake and transfer of contaminants, i.e., translocation, to aboveground portions of the plants. Various species of plants, depending on the contaminant, soil, climate, and local conditions are planted and grown. Some are harvested like crops (e.g., grasses) and others maintained for removal and sequestration of the contaminants for longer time periods. The harvested materials can be treated and recycled by various methods, including composting and other bioremediation approaches and thermal processes, depending on the sequestered pollutants (e.g., content and form of halogenated and metallic compounds). This procedure may be repeated as necessary to decrease soil contaminant levels down to target cleanup concentrations. If thermally treated, e.g., incinerated, emissions and ash residues must meet regulatory requirements, including disposal as a possible hazardous waste. Nickel, zinc, and copper are metals that have been particularly amenable to phytoextraction because hundreds of plant species have mechanisms for their uptake and absorption. This would seem to indicate numerous other metals would also be candidates because the micronutrient cycling and translocation mechanisms may be similar.</p><p>Rhizofiltration (rhizo-root) is the adsorption or precipitation of dissolved compounds onto plant roots or absorption into the roots. Rhizofiltration usually addresses contaminated groundwater, whereas phytoextraction targets contaminated soil. Thus, the plants are usually grown hydroponically in greenhouses and exposed to water from the contaminated site once the plants grow mature root systems. This acclimation step allows the plant's endogenous processes to adapt incrementally to exposure to the chemicals in the water. After acclimation, the plants are transplanted in soil above the contaminated aquifer or perched water table, and when their uptake is considered to have reached a threshold they are harvested and the biomass treated similarly to those from phytoextraction.</p><p>Phytostabilization immobilizes contaminants in the soil and groundwater by sorption and accumulation by roots, by adsorption onto roots, or by precipitation within the root zone of plants (rhizosphere). The biochemodynamics hinder transport, e.g., to the groundwater or air, as well as decreasing bioavailability of the contaminants.</p><p>In addition to these physical translocation and filtering processes, plants can degrade pollutants, using mechanisms similar to microbial degradation. Phytodegradation or phytotransformation is the process of degrading compounds after uptake by the plant's metabolism. It may also involve the breakdown of compounds externally by exogenous secretions, such as enzymes. Complex organic molecules follow similar degradation pathways to those of microbes, discussed in Chapter 3 and this chapter. That is, the complex molecules are broken down into simpler compounds to gain energy and to build plant biomass, similar to the mechanisms in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.1.</p><p>Rhizodegradation goes by a number of names, including enhanced rhizosphere biodegradation, phytostimulation, and planted-assisted bioremediation/degradation. However, it is actually the same microbial process as that described earlier in  32 Biofiltration without a liquid phase used to treat vapor phase pollutants. Air carrying the volatilized contaminants upward through porous media (e.g., compost) containing microbes acclimated to break down the particular contaminants. The wastes at the bottom of the system can be heated to increase the partitioning to the gas phase. Microbes in the biofilm surrounding each individual compost particle metabolize the contaminants into simpler compounds, eventually converting them into carbon dioxide and water vapor. this chapter. That is, rhizodegradation is biodegradation by microbes using the contaminants as their energy and carbon sources, but in this case the degradation is conducted by a specific type of bacterium that has adapted to the root environment, in which numerous chemical exudations occur (for example, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_34">Figure 1</ref>.4). Such degradation is enhanced by both extracellular and intracellular enzymes.</p><p>Microbes degrade soil-borne contaminants microbially, but these mechanisms are enhanced by the biochemodynamics of the root zone (the rhizosphere). This process is slower usually than phytodegradation. This process can enhance co-metabolism because plant roots release natural substances, e.g., sugars, alcohols, and acids, that are food for soil microorganisms. The fixation and release of nutrients are also a natural type of biostimulation for the microbes. In addition, the roots provide conduits and physical loosening of soil, improving microbial contact with oxygen and nutrients.</p><p>Phytovolatilization is both a transport and a transformation process. A plant takes up a compound from the soil or aquifer and transpires it to the troposphere. This can be solely the parent compound, if it resists degradation (i.e., metabolism and growth products), or it may be the metabolic degradation products, or both. For example, a poplar may volatilize as much as 90% of the volatile organic compound taken up by the tree.</p><p>Phytoremediation has been used successfully on a variety of compounds in numerous locations (see <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>.2). The local conditions and properties of the contaminants determine the degree of degradation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOMARKERS</head><p>When a contaminant interacts with an organism, substances like enzymes are generated as a response. Thus, measuring such substances in fluids and tissues can provide an indication or "marker" of contaminant exposure and biological effects resulting from the exposure. The term biomarker includes any such measurement that indicates an interaction between an environmental hazard and a biological system <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In fact, biomarkers may indicate any type of hazard, chemical, physical, and biological (see  An exposure biomarker is often an actual measurement of the contaminant itself and/or any chemical substance resulting from the metabolism and detoxification processes that take place in an organism. For example, measuring total lead (Pb) in the blood may be an acceptable exposure biomarker for people's exposures to Pb. However, other contaminants are better reflected by measuring chemical byproducts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Exposure biomarkers are also useful as an indication of contamination of fish and wildlife in ecosystems. For example, measuring the activity of certain enzymes, e.g., ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) in fish in vivo, indicates that the organism has been exposed to planar halogenated hydrocarbons, PAHs, or other similar contaminants. The mechanism for EROD activity in the fish is the receptor-mediated induction of cytochrome P450-dependent mono-oxygenases when exposed to these contaminants <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to being used to indicate rate and amount of bioremediation, biomarker information can provide insights into possible impacts from biotechnologies. <ref type="bibr">For</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GENETIC ENGINEERING BASICS</head><p>With the growth of genetic engineering, bioengineers saw opportunities to speed up and tailor the degradation processing using genetically altered organisms to make them more drought tolerant, more nutritionally productive, better tasting, more pest resistant and more efficient biological factories to produce pharmaceuticals. They also began to perceive that genetically altered microbes could enhance methods at removing and degrading chemical contamination.</p><p>The processes and mechanisms discussed in this chapter have been put to use to treat wastes, especially wastewater and groundwater contamination, for over a century. Much of the work simply enhanced the performance of naturally occurring microbes, e.g., soil bacteria that gradually become acclimated in using the wastes as energy sources. Genetic engineering was seen as a way to improve these natural processes.</p><p>Genetic engineering is no different than other types of engineering in the sense that scientific principles are being applied to improve a system's performance, whether it is to improve the cellular metabolic rates to enhance environmental cleanup or to provide better pharmaceuticals. The difference has resided in the scientific principles that were being applied. For a few decades now, this is being accomplished by novel ways of selecting certain traits (genetic expressions).</p><p>A genetically modified organism (GMO) is one the genetic material for which has been changed in a way that does not occur under natural conditions through cross-breeding or natural recombination <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Thus, a genetically engineered (GE) organism's genetic material has been altered using technologies based on recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA). It seems unsatisfying, even absurd, to say that the "only" difference between a GE organism and its natural counterpart is the rDNA, because this form of DNA does not exist in natural, unaltered organisms, but is engineered combining DNA sequences in novel ways.</p><p>In sequencing, the order of specific nucleotide bases (i.e., adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine) in the DNA molecule is manipulated to change the genetic expression. Sequencing has grown rapidly with improvements of analytical technology. In addition to the famous Human Genome Project, complete DNA sequences have become available for numerous organisms important to environmental biotechnology, especially those of microbial genomes.</p><p>Actually, the genetic engineering revolution is a continuum from conventional breeding approaches to modification with the introduction of foreign DNA to modification by the transfer of foreign DNA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONVENTIONAL BREEDING APPROACHES</head><p>Desirable traits to improve agricultural crops have been occurring for millennia. If the genetic information already resides in a subpopulation of the species, plants and animals with certain traits are bred by crossing a well-performing, survivable line with a line with the desired characteristics. When the desired trait does not reside within the species, but does exist in distantly related varieties, cell tissue culture can be used to obtain fertile generations from normally sterile crossings.</p><p>Such methods take advantage of innate DNA without insertion of foreign DNA. When a desirable trait is manifested, it is encouraged to reproduce and the strain is multiplied. This can take considerable time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MODIFICATION OF ORGANISMS WITHOUT INTRODUCING FOREIGN DNA</head><p>Occasionally, mutant lines with the desired characteristics are selected by chemical mutagenesis using various chemical substances such as alkylating agents (e.g., ethane-methyl-sulphonate and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) by irradiation, or by using naturally occurring transposable genetic elements, known as transposons <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Transposons are sometimes called "hopping genes" because of their unpredictable or random presence in species. Transposons that move about a genome via an RNA intermediate are known as retrotransposons. When stressed, transposons and retrotransposons can be "encouraged" to move. A copy of the transposon is made at the original site on the chromosome using reverse transcriptase. Such movement may stimulate genes that express the desired trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. The various approaches exhibit different characteristics, e.g., ethane-methyl-sulphonate application produces primarily cytosine to thymine changes in the DNA, resulting in C/G to T/A transition mutations in the DNA.</p><p>These methods make use of the mobile capabilities of "otherwise inactive fragments" of an organism's own DNA, transposons, and retrotransposons. The genetic reshuffling of a chromosome's genome provides the changes sought by the genetic engineer.</p><p>Another approach is to perform in situ microsurgery to induce changes in transposons. In fact, the surgery is designed to mimic the random changes mentioned above, but by physically moving transposons. Transposons can be inserted midway through a coding sequence, so that a gene's function is destroyed or modified, leading to a new gene product. Another approach is to target the regulatory portion of the genome to increase or decrease gene expression. Thus, the organism will produce a protein not previously made by the organism (i.e., proteomics). Rarely, insertion of a transposon is made downstream from the regulatory promoter so that a dormant gene will be expressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MODIFICATION OF ORGANISMS BY INTRODUCING FOREIGN DNA</head><p>The addition of relevant DNA into an existing organism's DNA changes the code so that certain traits are expressed. Novel genes are introduced to another organism's genome by various methods, but fall into two basic categories: transfection and infection using vectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfected DNA</head><p>Genetic material can be physically injected into a cell nucleus, i.e., transfection. Transfection can be enhanced using various methods. For example, the DNA can cross membranes through transient pores that open using electric pulses, i.e., electroporation. DNA can also be added to a cell by using polycations to neutralize the electrical charges on the DNA molecule and the cell surface that would ordinarily prohibit DNA uptake. Lipofection, i.e., enclosing the DNA in a lipid vesicle, can also be used to transmit the DNA through the lipophilic sites on the cell membrane, mimicking viral transfer. Sperm can also be used to carry foreign DNA, e.g., via intracytoplasmic sperm injection or by electroporation. Widely used approaches for transferring DNA for genetic modification include microinjecting DNA into eggs or embryos, transfer via bacterial plasmids, and biolistic or so-called "shotgun" methods.</p><p>Biolistic impaction is another method of inserting foreign DNA into an organism. Particles, often of gold or titanium, are used as projectiles with the desired gene sorbed to the particle surface. Pressurized helium is used to project the particles into the organism's cells. Those that take up the inserted DNA are identified by a marker gene and cultured.</p><p>Microinjection of DNA into eggs or embryos has been used since 1980. The objective is to instill a certain trait from a known DNA sequence, often in animals, that induces the organism to produce a new protein. A promoter is a region of the gene in which messenger RNA synthesis begins. The terminator is the region in which RNA synthesis ends. So, when the RNA is formed, it travels to the cytoplasm wherein ribosomes produce the specific protein that gives the desired trait. It is not certain that the trait will be expressed, because the insertion into the chromosome is random. More commonly, insertion of the gene is facilitated by a DNA carrier, such as a plasmid or a virus. The embryo is implanted into the animal's uterus. This is known as a "knock-in" method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Vector-Borne DNA</head><p>Two types of vectors can deliver foreign DNA to a cell: viruses and plasmids. Retroviruses infect a cell by reverse transcription, wherein the viral RNA genome is copied into DNA, which is then integrated into the host cell DNA. At that point, the integrated (i.e., modified) DNA can be genetically expressed by the invaded cell's normal transcription mechanisms. This has been done to introduce genetic traits into animal somatic tissue and for germ line modification (fish and birds, for example) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Transposons provide another common method of genetic modification, taking advantage of bacteria's ability to penetrate cell walls and the cell's nuclear membrane, so that the gene with the desired trait will be incorporated into the organism's genome or chromosomes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.33). Transposons are not only used in microbes, but have increasingly been used to transmit DNA in plants and animals.</p><p>Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules. They are often circular and double-stranded, but are separate from the DNA in the chromosome. Plasmids can independently replicate. These features have made plasmids the choice of vector for numerous genetic engineering applications.</p><p>As mentioned in Chapter 1, biotechnology is often a way of mimicking nature. This is certainly the case in vectors used for genetic modification. As evidence, biologists have observed the behavior of the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, leading them to some rather widely used approaches to seek biomimicry. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites. Part of their survival depends on their ability to insert genes into plant hosts, eliciting a crown gall, i.e., proliferation of cells near the soil surface. The genetic information for infecting the plant's neoplasmic growth is encoded within the plasmid. The Agrobacterium infection entails the transfer of DNA (T-DNA or Ti) to a random site in the plant genome. This natural capability to transfer genes has been put to use by bioengineers in biotechnologies. That is, agrobacteria are used to send foreign genes into plants by cutting out the bacterial T-DNA of the plasmid and replacing it with the desired foreign gene. This has been done on various species of dicotyledonous plants.</p><p>Thus, plasmids are transferable genetic elements that can replicate autonomously within a host. In this sense they resemble the retroviruses, but differ in that the plasmids are actually "naked" forms of DNA. That is, plasmids do not encode genes necessary to encase the genetic material for transfer to a new host. The foreign DNA is introduced with this recombinant DNA technology and still must be transmitted through the germ line so that every cell has the same modified genetic material. Bioengineering's use of plasmid host-to-host for genetic modification relies on the transfer of genetic material directly by conjugation, i.e., modifying in-host gene expression so as to enhance the uptake of the genetic element by transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Microbial transformation with plasmid DNA is not parasitic, nor is it symbiotic. It simply provides a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer within a population of microbes and typically provides a selective advantage under a given set of environmental conditions. Engineering plasmids also can instill an ability of microbes to change nutrient cycling, such as bacteria fixing elemental nitrogen or to degrade persistent organic compounds by advantageous microbial metabolism and growth in hostile, nutrient-deprived conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Genetic modification, whether by transfection or from transposons' ability to carry genes to cells, may well end up giving the modified organisms competitive advantages over natural species within an environmental niche. From a systematic, environmental perspective, this certainly can be good for environmental cleanup, because the advantage can increase biodegradation. However, it can be bad if the competitive advantage changes microbial diversity in a negative way. Also, some of the proteins produced may be toxic and disrupt the life cycles of other organisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF CISGENIC AND TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS</head><p>Genetically engineered organisms that have been modified exclusively by using the DNA from their own species are called cisgenic species. Cisgenesis in microbes may not be all that different from natural gene flow, because microorganisms reproduce so rapidly and microbial populations drift so readily that many of the DNA insertions probably have already occurred. For example, adaptation and acclimation for biodegradation of organic matter may result from the microbe's ability to "insert" DNA in a few organisms, which rapidly reproduce due to their selective competitive advantage.</p><p>Conversely, GE organisms that receive DNA from a different species than their own are known as transgenic species, so their competitive advantages may not resemble any in the past. In recent decades, genetic research has expanded the use of rDNA methodologies that permit the introduction of genes from distantly related species or even from different biologic kingdoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BIOENGINEERING CONSIDERATIONS FOR GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS</head><p>Bioremediation, whether enhanced by biotechnology or not, can occur in in situ treatments, i.e., in which the water, soil or sediment is contaminated in the real world, or it can be ex situ, i.e., excavating and transporting the contaminated material to a treatment center. Ex situ bioremediation allows for more variety in techniques, from entirely "natural" approaches of land application of sludges and wastewater, to land farming of contaminated materials, to bioreactors making use of genetically modified microbes, co-metabolism, and enzymatic processes. Up to a few decades ago, many of these processes were "black boxes," in which the result was rather well understood, but the specific mechanisms were not. As these mechanisms became better understood, engineers were able to replicate and to enhance the use of microbes in engineered systems, i.e., bioreactors. This imparts greater control over the degradation processes and, as a result, can expedite the rate of the biotechnological processes (e.g., specifically enhanced microbes) and physicochemical processes (adding nutrients and dissolved oxygen, changing redox) taking place in the bioreactors. Let us briefly consider some of the important environmental biotechnological applications.</p><p>The first step in applying biological principles to treat a waste requires that the microorganisms' can be cultured reliably. This is difficult in natural microbial populations, but because genetically engineered bacteria rarely function in the wild, tools are needed to characterize their actual and expected behavior in the environment. To address these challenges, bioengineers can apply the so-called "omics" tools, beginning with genomics, i.e., characterizing the complete genetic information of these organisms. Some currently used tools include methods to monitor electron acceptance and electron donation, enzyme probes to measure microbial functional activity in the environment, functional genomic and phylogenetic microarrays, metabonomics, proteomics, and quantitative approaches for genetic testing (e.g., quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction [Q-PCR/qPCR] or kinetic polymerase chain reaction). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.34 illustrates one conception of the use of omics tools to predict outcomes of environmental biotechnologies, especially in ecosystems. Genomics, including functional genomics, proteomic and systems modeling characterize community population ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, and ecosystem dynamics. Usually, DNA extracted from an environmental sample is cloned from a library or affixed to beads, and then directly sequenced. Following assemblage of the sequence, the computational identification of marker genes allows for the members of the community to be identified and phylogenetically classified. Thereupon, probes can be designed for later population-scale experiments (i.e., structure). Identification of the marker genes within fragments, along with other characterizations (e.g., GC content bias and codon usage preferences) allows for assigning sequence fragments into groups that correspond to one type of organism (i.e., "binning"). Functional capabilities of communities are described by computationally annotating genomes, i.e., predicting genes and assigning function using characterized homologs and genomic context. Information and knowledge pertaining to the presence of the genes also allows for the application of other "omics" approaches, including evaluation of the extracts of proteins and RNA transcripts from the environmental sample. Such investigations inform and enhance systems modeling efforts, which in turn can be applied to understanding and predicting ecosystem dynamics and lead the way to future investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>One of the challenges of environmental biotechnology is the ability to determine success or failure of systems, whether in a bioreactor (ex situ) or in the field (in situ). The "omics" techniques, such as those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.35, certainly will help, as will improved models and field techniques (see Discussion Box: Measuring Biodegradation Success). Bioengineers must   select the treatment system that meets the design requirements. Certainly, biotechnologies have emerged that provide a substantial part of these requirements.</p><p>Computational modeling can be both descriptive and predictive within a spectrum ranging from highly specified and reductive approaches to abstracted and systematic methods (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.36). The use of such models is an exercise in optimization. The U.S. National Institute of General Medical Sciences aptly states:</p><p>Most biological systems are too complex for even the most powerful computational models to capture all the system properties. A useful model, however, should be able to accurately conceptualize the system under study and provide reliable predictive values. To accomplish this, a certain level of abstraction may be required that focuses on the system behaviors of interest while neglecting some of the other details . A useful model . should be able to accurately conceptualize the system under study and provide reliable predictive values. To accomplish this, a certain level of abstraction may be required that focuses on the system behaviors of interest while neglecting some of the other details <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Environmental systems are arguably even more complex than most medical systems, because they not only include human individuals, subpopulations, and populations, but also those of other species, as well as the abiotic environments that compose ecosystems. Thus, abstraction becomes even more necessary, but the concomitant uncertainties can be increased as organismal and environmental system uncertainties are propagated. This spectrum in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.35 will be better characterized as better data are gathered. The advantage of computational approaches, however, is that they can be based on the first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology, whereas typical environmental models have often had to rely on probabilities and site-specific characteristics. That is to say, stochastic and deterministic models can benefit from the information that can be input from computational tools (e.g., metabonomics and proteomics). At present, however, the most commonly employed models rely on differential equations that characterize those biochemical and biophysical interactions among system components that are thought to represent a particular aspect of the system (e.g., dynamic properties of protein expression that would not be seen looking at individual proteins) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Thus, appropriately scaled mathematical models that capture the underpinning principles at work in biochemical processes set the stage for computational models that continuously improve predictions of environmental consequences. This three-stage loop is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.36. For example, the effect on ecosystem function and structure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 7</ref>.34) from an introduced genetically modified microbe will be better characterized in the biochemical and mathematical models, but these systematic impacts ultimately depend on the computation approach. However, the improved systems biology and engineering better informs the biochemical model, which improves the mathematics and further enhances the computational model's predictive capacity.</p><p>In addition, improvements in the precision, accuracy, and reliability of the measurement tools in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.34 (e.g., marker genes, phytotyping, and environmental sampling) will improve all three modeling levels, because the realworld data both ground truths each model and provides actual data to allow for more and better extrapolations and interpolations about the biological systems. For example, combining chemical and biological exposure assessment tools like advanced molecular indicators of exposure and biosensors based on nanotechnologies will allow for measurements of biologically relevant exposures simultaneously with measurements of multiple real-world stressors. They may also link mechanistically traditional exposure metrics with in vitro assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Box</head><p>Measuring Biodegradation Success Determining the amount and rate of degradation of toxic pollutants in soil and groundwater is difficult and often requires invasive techniques, such as deploying extensive monitoring well networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Even with these networks, degradation rates across entire systems cannot readily be extrapolated from the samples. When organic compounds are degraded by microbes, especially nitrifying bacteria, oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) are released to the atmosphere (see discussion of the biogeochemistry of nitrogen in Chapter 2, especially <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">Figure 2.15)</ref>. Thus, the flux of nitric oxide (NO) from the soil to the lower troposphere can be used to predict the rate at which organic compounds are degraded.</p><p>The measurement of NO emissions can be used as a screening tool for the success of in situ bioremediation, as well as an indirect measure of releases of toxic organic compounds to the atmosphere. This is done by tracking the production of NO results from both biotic and abiotic processes including nitrification, denitrification, chemodenitrification, and other microbial processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In soils, however, most NO is produced biotically <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Several nitrifiers and denitrifiers have been reported to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. A recent study of a monoaromatic hydrocarbon-contaminated aquifer found the concentration of nitrate to be inversely related to concentration of monoaromatic (i.e., single-ring) hydrocarbons, suggesting that nitrate reduction and degradation of organic ring compounds (i.e., aromatics) are related <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>Toluene (C 7 H 8 ) is designated a toxic air pollutant under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act Amendments. Its chemistry is similar to other aromatics in that it includes a substituted methyl group at one of the six positions of the benzene ring. It is also representative of a large group of contaminants that are frequently found near leaking underground storage tanks, i.e., the so-called "BTEX" group (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene). The BTEX chemicals are indicators of gasoline and other ubiquitous fuels that have been known to contaminate large areas of soil and groundwater. In addition, toluene is important from a biodegradation standpoint because it serves as a substrate for specific microbial populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Soil microorganisms exposed to toluene at varying concentrations respond differently to the toluene; hence the NO emissions from soil will be affected differently. Thus, toluene is a good candidate indicator of the degradation of a wide range of organic soil contaminants in soils, especially those that can be linked to NO releases.</p><p>Landfills and other storage, treatment, and disposal systems often employ microbial processes to degrade pollutants. The ultimate indication of success of aerobic microbial degradation is the production of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and water, and the indication of complete anaerobic microbial degradation is the production of methane (CH 4 ) and water. However, numerous abiotic and biotic reactions produce various products either as side reactions or as steps toward complete digestion. Managing in situ bioremediation projects requires reliable monitoring in the field so that adjustments can be made (e.g., injection of air or O 2, changing from exclusively natural to genetically enhanced microbial populations). Both passive biotechnological systems, such as natural attenuation, and active remediation systems, such as pump and treat, including those using genetically modified microbes, require extensive and elaborate monitoring for regulatory compliance, process control, and performance measurement. This can be measured directly by analysis of soil and groundwater samples in an analytical laboratory. These monitoring activities often include quarterly groundwater or soil sampling required for periods up to and exceeding 30 years. Unfortunately, these direct measures of bioremediation are often expensive and sample collection and analysis is often time-consuming <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In fact, measurement data are almost always extended using models, such as simple and direct interpolation between sampling points. Indirect measures of bioremediation are not meant to replace analytical testing of samples, but can be useful as surrogate indicators of bioremediation success. In this case, measuring NO emissions and modeling attendant toluene remaining in a contaminated site can decrease the number of samples requiring expensive analysis, and can allow for a real-time, integrated, and system-wide measure of remediation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Boxdcont'd</head><p>Nitric Oxide as an Indicator of Degradation Emissions of NO from soil are influenced by physical, chemical, and biological parameters of soil. Important variables in the production, transformation, and transport of NO from soils include pH, soil moisture content, temperature, physical and chemical soil properties, nutrient availability, atmospheric pressure, native microbial populations, and naturally occurring inhibitors of these microbial populations. NO emitted from soils represents a significant source of atmospheric NO. However, it is difficult to study the influence of soil variables on NO flux under field conditions because the net flux of NO between soil and atmosphere results from myriad processes that operate simultaneously and are regulated independently from each other, as well as other processes that are interdependent and affect one another (e.g., nutrient cycling, which affects the soil's ionic strength, which in turn affects pH and nitrogen speciation). Therefore, laboratory experiments are necessary to control these parameters and delineate the importance of various parameters on the NO flux from soils.</p><p>Soils consist of living and nonliving components existing in complex and heterogeneous mixtures. Soil microorganisms play an important role in the breakdown and transformation of organic matter, with many species contributing to different aspects of soil fertility. Any long-term interference with these biochemical processes can interfere with nutrient cycling, which could alter the soil fertility. Transformation of carbon and nitrogen compounds occurs in all fertile soils. The pathways for transformation of carbon and nitrogen need to be characterized to monitor the bioremediation of organic contaminants when used as a carbon source for soil microorganisms, although the microbial communities responsible for these processes differ from soil to soil. Simulation models that describe these carbon and nitrogen pathways in the soil system in great detail can be important tools in this respect.</p><p>In 1998, over 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of toluene was released into the environment from 3801 facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Elevated concentrations of toluene can be toxic to certain microorganisms, including eukaryotic cells in organisms and in prokaryotic bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, so the compound is also important to pretreatment and other environmental engineering processes. This is an instance of how certain genetically modified strains can help in bioremediation. For example, if the bacteria can gain resistance to toluene toxicity, the initial shock when the microbes come into contact with the wastes would be reduced. Despite its toxicity, however, toluene has been demonstrated to be readily bioremediated in a manner similar to other substituted benzenes, which account for a large share of contaminants found in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. This suggests that the structural activity relationships of toluene are indicative of those of other aromatic contaminants. So, perhaps, the indirect methods for estimating how much toluene remains in polluted sites can be used for quite a few more aromatic compounds.</p><p>To develop a model using indirect measurements first requires laboratory experiments of the NO flux from soil exposed to varying levels of toluene. Next, the lab findings must be analyzed and correlated to arrive at NOetolueneesoil microbial activity relationships to document the viability of using NO as a surrogate indicator of bioremediation in toluene-contaminated soil. Then, a mathematical model is adapted to characterize and estimate the NOetolueneesoil microbial relationships in a complex soil system. Finally, the laboratory results are compared to the results derived from the models, and the model appropriately adjusted.</p><p>In the laboratory, toluene and water were added to the soil to achieve approximately 30% water-filled pore space and five different tolueneesoil amendment regimens: 0, 5, 30, 45, or 60 parts per million (ppm). After the toluenecontaminated soil was incubated at room temperature (22 C) over varying time periods, the soil was then transferred to a dynamic test chamber (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.37) for measurement of NO emissions, the concentration of toluene in soil and headspace vapor was measured, and the microbial activity was determined using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Humility in Biotechnological Modeling</head><p>There are many methods for predicting the future. For example, you can read horoscopes, tea leaves, tarot cards, or crystal balls. Collectively, these methods are known as "nutty methods." Or you can put well-researched facts into sophisticated computer models, more commonly referred to as "a complete waste of time." Scott Adams, US cartoonist <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. This is a good time to remind ourselves that predicting environmental outcomes using intricate models and scientific information requires a healthy dose of humility. Part of Adams' comic strip Dilbert's appeal is that it often includes some underlying truth, however humorously exaggerated. This particular quote indeed contains an admonition to those of us who use models to try to get at the truth. Not to get too philosophical, but there is a scientific corollary to Plato's famous allegory of the cave, or St. Paul's admonition that humans are quite limited in their view of how things work. Both warn us that what our limited senses tell us is at best incomplete, and sometimes misleading if we use the wrong set of metrics and assumptions. We may not understand much about a system, but it may seem to keep giving us reliable results. This is what scientists may call a "black box."</p><p>We often see correlations in complex systems, but cannot explain them. In fact, environmental systems are very complex and multivariable. We seldom have a lot of certainty about how to weight the variables and how to set up algorithms in models. In fact, environmental models are generally distinguished as to whether they are mainly stochastic or deterministic. A stochastic model is built under assumptions of randomness. Thus, it is statistically based. Conversely, deterministic models are built from an understanding of how things work. They are built on the assumption that there is indeed one solution; all we have to do is properly parameterize our model. That is, to find the solution, we must identify all the elements and factors that influence the outcome and assign values to them. So, if we have a strong understanding of microbial processes and the conditions that lead to degradation Discussion Boxdcont'd of a particular compound, we may be able to construct a deterministic model to estimate rates of biodegradation for that specific microbial population under prescribed environmental conditions.</p><p>Developing an Indirect, Chemical Model of Microbial Activity When discussing this model, it is important to remind ourselves about the uncertainties and the need for humility in its application. That said, we are ready to discuss how such a model can be built, starting with some background of how microbes get their energy.</p><p>All other things being equal, microbes with the most efficient metabolic mechanisms grow at the fastest rate, so these organisms will overwhelm the growth of microbes with less efficient redox systems. Thus, if O is available in surplus, this will be the preferred reaction in the model. Once a system becomes anaerobic, nitrate is the most preferred redox reaction, followed by solid phase ferric iron, sulfate, and carbon dioxide (the least preferred redox reaction).</p><p>A thermodynamically dictated system would give preference, even exclusivity, to the reaction that provides the most energy, so a model that uses a sequential process does not allow the microbes to use any other less preferred electron acceptor until the more preferred acceptor is depleted. However, in reality, when monitoring wells are analyzed near plumes undergoing active biodegradation, the samples are seldom entirely depleted of one or more of these electron acceptors. There are seldom such "bright lines" in the field. For example, facultative aerobes, those that can shift from oxygen to anaerobic electron acceptors (especially nitrate), can change electron acceptors even when molecular oxygen is not completely depleted. This can be attributed to the fact that redox potentials for oxygen and nitrate are not substantially different (at pH 7, O 2 ¼ þ820 V and NO ¼ þ740 V, compared to CO 2 ¼ À240 V). Also, the apparent divergence from pure thermodynamics in the field may simply be a sampling artifact, which can be attributed to the way monitoring is conducted. For example, monitoring wells do not collect water from a "point." Rather, the screens (the perforated regions of underground piping through which water enters) are set at 1.5 to 3 m intervals, so waters will mix from different vertical horizons. Thus, if different reactions are occurring with depth, these are actually aggregated into a single water sample.</p><p>When a contaminant degrades sequentially, the slowest degradation step has the greatest influence on the time it takes the chemical to break down. If this most sensitive step can be sped up, the whole process can be sped up. Conversely, if an engineer or scientist devotes much time and effort to one of the faster steps in the degradation sequence, little or no enhancement to the degradation process may occur. Thus, bioengineers need to take care not to overgeneralize, assuming a contamination plume is limited by oxygen or even other redox conditions. Adding iron to an anaerobic system or pumping air into an aerobic stratum of an aquifer will help, but only so much. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.38 demonstrates a way to apply microbial kinetics limits to redox. The actual degradation can take a number of breakdown paths. For example, two possible anaerobic degradation pathways for benzene are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.39.</p><p>Laboratory and the field measurements can differ regarding the presence of confounding chemical mixtures in real contamination scenarios. For example, leaking underground storage tanks (LUSTs) are a widespread problem. It is tempting to think that because these tanks contain refined fuels, that  Discussion Boxdcont'd most spills will be similar. However, each compound has specific physicochemical properties that will affect its reactivity and movement in the environment. As evidence, the BTEX compounds of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes usually compose only a small amount (ranging from about 15 to 26%) of the mole fraction of gasoline or jet fuel <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. However, largely because the BTEX compounds have high aqueous solubilities (152e1780 mg L À1 ) compared to the other organic constituents (0.004 e1230 mg L À1 ) in these fuels, they often account for more than two-thirds of the amount of the contaminants that migrate away from the LUST. Also, soils are seldom homogeneous, so even if the contaminant is well characterized, how it will react and move is largely affected by the media's characteristics, such as their potential to sorb pollutants. Ease of implementation and sensitivity are both important considerations when deciding how to address environmental problems. In some situations, steps that are readily available may be relatively insensitive to the intended outcome. In other situations, immediate and relatively inexpensive measures can be taken that are sensitive, such as pumping air and water to speed up biodegradation in an aquifer that has already shown natural attenuation.</p><p>The challenge for the bioengineer is to understand the entire system. Based on this understanding, solutions to environmental problems can be developed. For example, if a bioengineer locks into one microbe, either one existing in the soil or introduced (e.g., a genetically modified Pseudomonas bacterium) based on the assumption that the degradation will be limited by kinetics (A in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.38), but in fact it is limited by the presence of a non-BTEX compound, the microbial degradation will not be efficacious. Ideally, improvements can be made by focusing first on actions that bring about the most improvements, i.e., in which the environmental responses are most sensitive to changes. Unfortunately, this works the other way as well. That is, some parts of the environment are highly sensitive to small changes. Small changes in surface water temperature, pH, or dissolved oxygen and other essential factors can greatly affect survival.</p><p>The highly interconnected carbon and nitrogen cycles can be modeled as a system <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 7</ref>.40). The soil organic matter (SOM) is divided into three pools that represent nitrogen, carbon, and toluene used as a different carbon source from outside of the system, respectively, whereas the inorganic nitrogen in the soil is divided into ammonium ðNH þ 4 Þ and nitrate ðNO <ref type="bibr">À</ref> 3 Þ species. To simplify the model, no distinction is made</p><p>Continued among the different bacterial colonies. All colonies are included in a single microorganism pool. Due to the high rate of nitrification, the presence of nitrite ðNO À 2 Þ was below limits of detection, so is not reported in this model. The system with three SOM pools suggested agreement with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jenkinson (1990)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Bolker et al. (1998)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Porporato et al. (2003)</ref> who studied models with different numbers of compartments to describe SOM and suggested using more than one and less than five pools for SOM <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>. The use of a single pool for microorganisms is justified by the scarce quantitative information available on soil microbial biomass. Only the input of the added mineral fertilizer (MF) and the outputs of NO and N 2 through nitrification and denitrification are determinants of the external fluxes to the soil system for the SOM nitrogen pool. For the SOM carbon pool, there was one input source (toluene), and three external fluxes (vapor phase toluene, carbon dioxide [CO 2 ], and soil residual toluene). The C/N ratios of the pools that contain organic matter need to be characterized in terms of the dynamics of nitrogen and carbon cycling. Understanding the mechanisms and the interactions of the controlling factors provides a way to integrate and to expand the information from specific studies.</p><p>This integration has been achieved through the use of conceptual models. As additional conceptual models are developed they can be incorporated into numerical simulation models, as in this research. <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>.3 summarizes the definition of the variables shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.40. Models using this same structure can be applied to other chemical compounds so long as there is a link to emitted gases other than the parent compound or even breakdown products from the parent compound. In this case, the actual metabolic and electron acceptance/donation need not necessarily be completely understood, because the model depends on a correlation between emitted gas mass and remaining mass of the parent compound to be biodegraded. In this sense, this model is less deterministic than a model that measures emitted metabolites or chemical degradation products, such as the degradations shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 7.39, 7</ref>.41, and 7.42.</p><p>To quantify the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in this system, numerical models include multiple state variables corresponding to functionally and dynamically distinguishable ecosystem components.

Also, because CH COO e is relatively volatile using the model in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.40 would provide an estimate of the rate of vinyl chloride degradation.</p><p>Applied Ecology Chapter | 7 343</p><p>Discussion Boxdcont'd describe the input source by immobilization (IMM) from NH þ 4 , which can be given by net nitrogen immobilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[54]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_32">2 i ¼ ε i 1 ðC=NÞ i À 1 21 (7.26)</formula><p>in which 2 i is net nitrogen immobilization and is a decomposition rate of carbon residues. Immobilization is defined as the conversion of inorganic nitrogen ions into an organic form by soil microorganisms which incorporate mineral ions to synthesize cellular components. Because the application of mineral fertilizer provides a form of ammonium ion, it is assumed that immobilization is unrestricted, which means that the bacteria can meet their nitrogen requirement and decompose the organic matter at a maximum potential rate.

Only about 0.1e0.4% of the NH þ 4 is being oxidized to NO À 2 and NO À 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[56]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Parameters</head><p>Conceptual development and construction of a toluene degradation model using carbon and nitrogen cycle require appropriate system parameters constrained by basic assumptions: (1) soil pH, temperature (22 C), and moisture content (WFPS 30%) are constant throughout the time period; (2) all microbes in the population are active and their growth rate is a fixed proportion of carbon and nitrogen so that their C/N ratio remains constant (C/N ratio is 8); and (3) the presence of nitrite ðNO À 2 Þ is very low and can be neglected because of the high rate of nitrification. These assumptions are reasonable and valid for the environmental conditions simulated by this model, but will likely not hold under extreme conditions of pH, temperature, and soil moisture content. The stochastic model of carbon and nitrogen cycle suggested above was validated using average rates derived from values reported in the literature within the constraints of general nitrogen and carbon dynamics, as well as from the experimental analysis and data.</p><p>The values of the constants k T , k c , and k b for the first-order kinetics of indigenous carbon and toluene decomposition and of soil microorganisms are estimated using the steady-state solutions of Eqns (7.15), (7.16) and <ref type="bibr">(7.22)</ref>, along with the average values of carbon in the indigenous, toluene, and soil microorganisms pool. When the temporal derivatives are set to zero and the values of the other variables are assigned the average conditions reported in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>.4, the solution of the linear system in these equations leads to the values of the k T , k c , and k b .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Evaluation</head><p>Data collected and analyzed from laboratory experiments of toluene degradation, quantification of soil microorganisms, and NO emissions from soil were used to characterize the physical, chemical, and biological algorithms for carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil. In turn, this information provided the toluene degradation parameter from which soil microbial activity could be matched with NO emissions from soil. Thus, the predictive model was developed by comparing the laboratory studies to the model output using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for linear regressions. The laboratory results indicated that microbial populations grew with respect to toluene concentration significantly (P 5% and most P values 1%), so this allowed for a mathematical relationship between microbial population size and toluene degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[58]</ref>. Also, the mass of NO released from soil in chambers had a direct relationship to microbial population size. Thus, a numerical model could be developed to link toluene concentrations in soil with NO flux measurement. This led to the development of a numerical model using ordinary differential equations, which could be evaluated from actual, direct measurements of the chemical undergoing degradation (toluene) and of the chemical being released by the microbes (NO).</p><p>The rate of NO production from soil and the toluene degradation in soil were measured directly. NO production rate and toluene degradation with different levels of toluene Continued Discussion Boxdcont'd contamination are closely linked, which suggests that NO is a good surrogate measurement for toluene bioremediation progress in soil. NO is produced mainly by nitrifiers and denitrifiers (which are important hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria). Specific identification of the actual microbial species producing the NO, however, is not necessary to link the rates of decomposition of organic contaminants to NO production. Although there were good correlations between the NO production rate and toluene degradation, long-term NO production that accompanies toluene degradation should be measured in future research, because this may offer insights as to how nitrifying bacteria growth and metabolism can be associated with biodegradation. From the relationship between NO production rate and toluene degradation the data can be integrated to estimate contamination persistence, making it possible to deduce the contamination levels and duration by extrapolating from NO production in soil.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Comparison to Laboratory Study for Toluene Degradation</head><p>Experimental data were correlated with the model values and found statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) for all levels of toluene concentration. However, the model values slightly overestimated experimental results from the 16 h incubation period and the model did not predict the observed decrease in toluene degradation between 1 and 16 h.</p><p>Typically, biodegradation followed a lag period, defined as the time period preceding significant chemical disappearance. The laboratory study and the model results were well matched because the model parameterssuch as fraction of volatilization of toluene (r T ) were determined in the laboratory, and therefore measured under similarly controlled laboratory conditions.</p><p>To compare the experimental data to model output, total cell counts (cells g À1 soil) derived from experimental data were  converted to carbon content in soil microorganisms (mg-C kg À1 soil). Positive correlations were found between model outputs and experimental measurements across all initial toluene concentrations (P &lt; 0.01). The values of model output approximate those determined from the quantification of soil microorganisms using FISH, indicating that the numerical model studied here properly describes the experimental data. The model developed for NO emission estimated NO flux well for both laboratory and field studies. The model reproduced the trends of the experimental measurements of NO flux from toluene-contaminated soil, showing that the simple balance equations of the model are able to capture the effectual dynamics of nitrogen and carbon transformation during the experiments.</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">(C/N) c N/A 16.4 (C/N) T N/A 0.033 (C/N) b N/A 8 r T N/A 0.14e0.32 r r N/A 0.6 r SRT N/A 0.37 a N/A 0.015e0.035 k T kg h À1 mg-C 1.8 Â 10 À5 k c kg h À1 mg-C 1.5 Â 10 À4 k b kg h À1 mg-C 0.35 k n N/A 0.</formula><p>The overall nitrification process is controlled primarily by ammonium and oxygen concentrations, Total N gas emissions can be modeled as proportional to the rates of gross mineralization and fertilizer input (Eqn (7.27)), and this suggestion has been supported by the large body of research showing increasing NO flux with increasing soil nitrogen and fertilization. The model output is largely affected by ammonium nitrogen conversion to NO production in soil.</p><p>As mentioned, nitrifiers are usually considered the major driver in most NO. Nitrifiers can survive and produce NO as a byproduct over a very wide range of pH, temperature, water content, soil texture, and nutrient availability. Diffusion and consumption of NO are also important factors affecting net release. Therefore, although denitrification may be a producer of NO, the factors of limited diffusion under denitrifying anaerobic conditions and consumption of NO by denitrifiers limit the contribution of denitrification to gross NO production. If nitrification is largely responsible for the net NO production as applied in this model, this would explain the favorable match between the studies and the model output.</p><p>The model output for the NO emissions at different levels of toluene amendment were also observed to follow the number of microorganisms trend observed at the same levels of toluene amendments. Therefore, the results support the hypothesis that NO emission is a good surrogate indicator of soil microbial activity in toluene-contaminated soil.</p><p>Carbon and nitrogen speciation and soil microbial activity can be used to predict the degradation of an organic toxic substance in soil. The model used an indirect, noninvasive metric (NO) to estimate rates of microbial population growth and the concomitant breakdown of toluene. The ratio of NO emission to toluene degradation was positively correlated across all levels of toluene concentrations and incubation times, meaning that NO emissions can be a good surrogate measure of toluene contamination in soil, if the duration of toluene incubation or initial soil toluene concentration is known. Therefore, NO flux from soil measured in the field may help to estimate the rate of toluene degradation in the soil and thus provide an ongoing metric of remediation success, an indication when soil remediation has met target concentrations, and a simple and integrated complement to postclosure monitoring (e.g., a spike in NO production and application of this model may indicate the presence of a new carbon source, which should be investigated). The simulated toluene concentration, number of soil microorganisms, and NO flux as a function of time showed statistical significance (P &lt; 0.01) for all levels of toluene concentration with the experimental data. This finding supports the adequacy of the model for supporting the NOetolueneesoil microbial relationship. The mathematical model derived in this study suggests a novel approach for characterizing and predicting the fate of other toxic aromatic compounds in soil. Because the results of the investigation were based on experimental data and the analysis was conducted under specific environmental conditions, the emphasis throughout the research focused on specific rather than general features of the dynamics. However, the results can presumably be extended to other bioremediation systems with different environmental conditions, so long as these systems are evaluated using the protocol described here.</p><p>Measured toluene concentrations in soil, microbial population growth, and NO fluxes in chamber studies based on carbon and nitrogen cycling provide useful information to those who manage toxic and criteria air pollutants. Nitric oxide may prove a valuable indicator of bioremediation of air toxic (i.e., toluene) concentrations. The model found that chemical concentration, soil microbial abundance, and NO production can be directly related to experimental results (significant at P &lt; 0.01) for all toluene concentrations tested. This indicates that the model may prove useful in monitoring and predicting the fate of toxic aromatic contaminants in a complex soil system. This can be valuable in predicting the duration of such contaminants in soil sinks, but may also prove useful to environmental decision making. The model developed from this research may prove useful in predicting emissions of oxides of nitrogen from soils contaminated with organic compounds. Therefore, the model may help in predicting the interrelations of ozone precursors, such as changes in reservoirs of hydrocarbons and releases of various oxides of nitrogen. As such, the model may be a tool for decision makers in ozone nonattainment areas. For example, an ozone nonattainment area that is hydrocarbon limited may benefit from the breakdown of organic compounds via nitrification or denitrification (i.e., lessening the sources of hydrocarbons stored and potentially available to be released to the atmosphere). Conversely, in an ozone nonattainment area that is NO x limited, the emissions of NO may need to be limited to reduce ambient concentrations of ozone (i.e., perhaps increasing bioremediation efforts during winter months and decreasing them in summer, thereby lowering NO x emissions when photochemical reaction rates are slower, thus limiting the production of ozone).</p><p>Future research should be conducted to characterize and to predict the fate of toxic aromatic compounds in soil and production of chemical and biological indicators of soil microbial activity to monitor the bioremediation processes: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> fitting the model to compounds other than toluene, especially those with more complicated substitutions; (2) investigating Nitrogen removal itself is a worthy goal of environmental biotechnology, and is benefiting from recent findings. The biofilm reactions discussed in this chapter are being applied in moving-bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) to remove nitrogen. For example, ammonia removal in MBBR efficiencies is affected by biofilm thickness and live cell coverage of the reactor media. Populations of more highly active nitrifying bacteria appear to increase with MBBR biofilm temperatures, and slightly greater quantities of lower active nitrifiers at cold temperatures. The thickness of the biofilm in the MBBR carriers also has been shown to increase with decreasing temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[62]</ref>.</p><p>Thus, it is important to characterize the microbial population when designing reactors to tailor them to remove and treatment various targets. These targets may be reactive substances (e.g., alkanes), recalcitrant substances (e.g., PCBs), or nutrients (e.g., nitrogen). Unfortunately, waste streams often consist of mixtures of all of these substances, so the reactor may have to be optimized based on the most likely and most troublesome substances and/or discrete systems may be needed. These discrete systems may be installed in sequence. For example, a substance may be toxic to beneficial microbes that are expected to degrade one type of waste. If so, this toxic substance would first have to be removed before the waste reaches that bioreactor. Indeed, physical separation (primary treatment) is often the initial step. This could be followed by a chemical treatment process (e.g., precipitation and pH adjustment), even before biotechnology is applied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WASTEWATER TREATMENT OVERVIEW</head><p>This chapter addresses the overarching aspects of biotechnology as it applies to all environmental applications. Every process described can apply to environmental remediation, no matter which environmental compartment, i.e., surface waters, groundwater, air, sediment, soil, or industrial reactors. However, the literature often takes special note of the role of biotechnology, especially microbial populations, in wastewater treatment. The processes at work in wastewater treatment, e.g., biodegradation and biosorption, have been discussed, as have several of the wastewater treatment designs, e.g., trickling filters, digesters, and lagoons. However, because the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of wastewater treatment facilities is a prominent part of environmental biotechnology, a brief overview of the specific steps is needed.</p><p>The first differentiation of wastewater treatment is whether the wastewater is to be treated onsite (e.g., septic tank), or whether the wastewater is to be collected and distributed to a central wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In developing nations, much of the wastewater is not treated at all, but is directly released into ditches or onto soil, where it may leach into groundwater and/or allowed to drain into surface waters. Even in developed nations, a large fraction of residences treat their wastes onsite; for example, each day about 25% of US population dispose of 1.5 Â 10 7 m 3 wastewater using onsite disposal and treatment systems, with an estimated 10% of these not functioning properly <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[71]</ref>.</p><p>Whether an onsite wastewater treatment system (OWTS) works "properly" is an expression of the rate and amount of destruction of harmful agents, especially pathogenic microbes and nutrients, but also toxic substances, such as consumer products and pharmaceuticals, that are intercepted and removed by the system (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.43). An efficient system is one that keeps pollutants from reaching drinking water supplies, e.g., aquifers and surface waters. For example, a system may be less efficient if beneficial bacteria do not have sufficient time of contact with the wastewater because the soil is too permeable, i.e., biosorption is not taking place at the optimal rate. The operation of a successful onsite system depends on the application of knowledge about the processes described in this chapter. Indeed, it is likely that genetically modified microbes will be used in onsite systems to a greater extent in a desire for greater efficiencies, especially if the density of housing units is high. The potential benefits and risks of these advanced systems, however, will need to be well understood before this occurs.</p><p>Onsite treatment usually involves a single unit for a residence. However, the processes can be expanded to include several units for entire neighborhoods. At the municipal scale, the WWTP employs the same physical and biological processes as those used in an onsite system, but for much larger volumes of wastewater. The first mechanism of a WWTP component, after receiving the wastewater from the collection system (e.g., sanitary sewer), is the use of gravity to remove solids, e.g., grit chambers and sedimentation tanks. This is known as primary treatment.</p><p>Secondary treatment includes most of the mechanisms described in this chapter. Here, up to 90% of organic matter is removed using biotechnologies. These may be trickling filters and other, so-called "attached growth" or "fixed film" processes, in which the microbial populations adhere to various types of media. They may also be systems like the activated sludge systems described in this chapter, known as "suspended growth processes." Secondary treatment may also employ aerated lagoons, slow-rate methods (e.g., land application), and constructed wetlands and other bioretention systems (US. Environmental Protection Agency, 2004 #294).</p><p>Advanced or tertiary treatment targets specific wastewater pollutants, such as nutrient (N and P) removal, and/or improved removal of other contaminants with advanced, and often expensive, technologies, such as coagulationesedimentation and granulated activated-carbon adsorption.</p><p>Finally, the biosolids and other wastewater residuals, i.e., sludge, must be handled. This can consist of variations among land application, incineration, and marketable products, such as dried-biosolid pellets and fertilizers for landscapes.</p><p>Wastewater treatment is certainly an important goal of environmental biotechnology and the application of microbial ecology. However, the same processes can be put to use in cleaning up contaminated soil, sediment, and groundwater, and in air pollution control equipment.</p></div>

Threats to the function and structure of coral reef ecosystems have been associated with wastewater discharges to major rivers that ultimately drain into oceans, carrying nutrients and microbial populations. More recently, these discharges have been found to contain drugs, personal care products, and antibiotics that are not degraded or are incompletely degraded, leading to stresses on aquatic ecosystems. For example, the corals off the coast of Florida, the world's third largest barrier reef, have been highly stressed, with half of the live coral off the Florida coast lost in the past few years. An additional indication is that fish feeding on these corals are developing deformities and experience premature mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[82]</ref>.</p><p>The threats to coral reefs come in many chemical and biological forms.

Global climate change and associated impacts including reduced rates of coral calcification, increased coral bleaching and mortality (associated with variety of stresses including increased sea surface temperatures), increased storm frequency, and sea level rise. Although all seven threats relate to biotechnologies, the sixth in the list appears to be an implication of microbial infestation and infection. These microbes appear to be transported long distances in winds aloft. For example, some of the invasive bacteria that threaten coral reef habitats may be coming from Africa in the form of Saharan dust. Deserts commonly contain gravel and bedrock, along with some sand. The Sahara is the exception, with sand covering 20% of the spatial extent of the desert. This means that the Sahara often loses large amounts of dust by winds that advectively transport particles in plumes thatcan travel across the Atlantic Ocean, depositing dust along the way (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.44). Saharan dust carries disease-causing bacteria and fungi that have been associated with the destruction of coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea.</p><p>Scientists from numerous disciplines are studying these phenomena and trying to evaluate the linkages, the threats, and possible interventions. The scientific goals associated with these threats, along with their respective ordinal (high, medium, and low) priorities for scientific research are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.45. Note that invasive species can include numerous organisms, but recently algae and bacteria have been highlighted as a much larger concern than had previously been thought. The bacteria are likely arriving in the coral reef ecosystems by long-range atmospheric transport. Note in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 7</ref>.46 that the actions recommended by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to address these threats vary by region. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 7.45 and 7</ref>.46 indicate that coral reefs are threatened by an array of physical, chemical, and biological stressors. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is an example of a physical stressor. UV radiation is a ubiquitous stressor that is very likely impacting human and ecological systems on a global scale. It has been implicated in observed shifts in polar plankton community composition, local and global declines in amphibian population abundance and diversity, coral bleaching syndrome, not to mention an increasing incidence of human skin cancer and other diseases.

The concentration of dissolved oxygen in Curve A remains above 0, so although the available oxygen is reduced, the system remains aerobic. Curve B sags where dissolved oxygen falls to 0, and anaerobic conditions result and continue until the DO concentrations begin to increase. D S is the background oxygen deficit before the pollutants enter the stream. D 0 is the oxygen deficit after the pollutant is mixed. D is the deficit for contaminant A which may be measured at any point downstream. This indicates both distance and time of microbial exposure to the source. For example, if the stream's average velocity is 5 km h À1 , D measured 10 km downstream also represents 2 h of microbial activity to degrade the pollutant.</figDesc></figure>

An aerobic treatment approach breaks down toxic substances from household or manufacturing sources. The waste is combined with recycled biomass and aerated to maintain a target dissolved oxygen (DO) content. Organisms use the organic components, expressed as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of waste as food, decreasing the organic levels in the wastewater. Oxygen concentrations must be controlled to maintain optimal treatment efficiencies. One means of achieving optimal DO content is tapered aeration (shown in the diagram).The tapered system provides high concentrations of oxygen near the influent to accommodate the large oxygen demand from microbes as waste is introduced to the aeration tank (photo).

The process of extended aeration, lasting up to greater than 30 h, might have a loading of between 0.05 and 0.20 with an efficiency of hazardous waste removal in excess of 95%. The process of conventional aeration, closer to 6 h for aeration, might have a loading between 0.20 and 0.50 with a treatment efficiency of possibly 90%. The process of rapid aeration, in the range of 1 to 3 h for aeration, might have a loading between 1.0 and 2.0 with removal efficiency closer to 85%. For each given problem, the engineer must design an individual activated-sludge facility based on laboratory testing of a specific hazardous waste; the engineer must operate that facility and select different loadings through time based on ongoing laboratory tests of the facility's input, process variables, and outputs.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seminar Topicdcont'd</head><p>An example of a chemical threat is tributyl tin, a potent endocrine-disrupting compound that was used throughout much of the twentieth century as an antifouling agent in coatings applied to watercraft. In other words, the tin compounds were added to paint for the stated purpose of preventing the growth of marine organisms. So, when the compounds leach into water, they continue this mode of action, including in coral reef habitats, decreasing the reproduction mechanisms in aquatic organisms. This was a major reason for the 2003 ban on this use of tributyl tin in the United States. This is also an example of an indirect biological threat, because tributyl tin first affects hormonal response at the cellular level, which in turn affects the overall structure and function of the coral community.</p><p>Biological agents can present an even greater and more ominous threat to coral reefs. The microbial ecology within a coral reef is complex. For example, some algae are symbiotic and others are parasitic to corals. Fungi are also widely distributed in calcium carbonate, i.e., they have the endolithic associations with corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[85]</ref>. Bacterial diseases are also appearing. Thus, various biological taxa of microorganisms </p></div>			</div>

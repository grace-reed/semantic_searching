				<p>Background: Secretory granule membrane proteins are retrieved and reused or degraded after exocytosis. Results: A pH-sensitive His cluster in the amidating enzyme is essential for its trafficking. Conclusion: Lacking this conserved His cluster, proteolytic maturation and generation of a soluble cytosolic fragment of amidating enzyme fail to occur, disrupting secretion and nuclear signaling. Significance: The storage and regulated secretion of peptides requires intraluminal signaling. Decreasing luminal pH is thought to play a role in the entry of newly synthesized and endocytosed membrane proteins into secretory granules. The two catalytic domains of peptidylglycine ␣-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a type I integral membrane protein, catalyze the sequential reactions that convert peptidyl-Gly substrates into amidated products. We explored the hypothesis that a conserved His-rich cluster (His-Gly-His-His) in the linker region connecting its two catalytic domains senses pH and affects PAM trafficking by mutating these His residues to Ala (Ala-Gly-Ala-Ala; H3A). Purified recombinant wild-type and H3A linker peptides were examined using circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence; mutation of the His cluster largely eliminated its pH sensitivity. An enzymatically active PAM protein with the same mutations (PAM-1/H3A) was expressed in HEK293 cells and AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells. Metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation revealed more rapid loss of newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A than PAM-1; although release of newly synthesized monofunctional PHM/ H3A was increased, release of soluble bifunctional PAM/H3A, a product of the endocytic pathway, was decreased. Surface biotinylation revealed rapid loss of PAM-1/H3A, with no detectable return of the mutant protein to secretory granules. Consistent with its altered endocytic trafficking, little PAM-1/H3A was subjected to regulated intramembrane proteolysis followed by release of a small nuclear-targeted cytosolic fragment. AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A adopted the morphology of wildtype AtT-20 cells; secretory products no longer accumulated in the trans-Golgi network and secretory granule exocytosis was more responsive to secretagogue.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Proteins destined for the secretory pathway are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and traverse multiple compart-ments of varying pH as they travel to their final destinations. In neurons and endocrine cells that store peptides for regulated secretion, soluble cargo, and essential membrane proteins must be targeted to secretory granules.

This reaction is catalyzed only by peptidylglycine ␣-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a bifunctional type I membrane protein ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>Protein Production and Purification-Sequences encoding exon 16 (rPAM-1(393-497)), exon 15/16 (rPAM-1(369 -497)), and exon 13/15/16 (rPAM-1(357-497)) were cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector in reading frame with GST and expressed in BL21 Eschrichia coli cells; constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial lysates (500 ml of culture) were prepared by sonication in PBS; following centrifugation, each supernatant was applied to a 5-ml GSTrap TM cartridge (GE Healthcare). After washing with PBS, on-column cleavage of the fusion protein was accomplished by overnight incubation at 4°C with HRV3C protease (80 units/500 ml of culture) (Eton Biosciences, San Diego, CA); the cartridge was washed with 20 mM NaTES (pH 7.0) to retrieve the recombinant protein. Further purification was accomplished by binding the eluate to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mM NaTES (pH 7.0) followed by elution with a gradient to 0.5 M NaCl in the same buffer over 60 min. Protein purity as judged by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 was at least 97%; recovery was ϳ60 -70% (5-6 mg of purified recombinant protein/500 ml of culture).</p><p>Fluorescence Spectroscopy-All fluorescence measurements were performed using a F2500 spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi, Japan) with a thermostated cell holder and a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Slit widths with a nominal bandpass of 10 nm were used for both excitation and emission beams. Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm after excitation at 295 nm; 20 mM NaMES buffer was used for the pH 5.0 to 6.0 range and 20 mM NaTES for the pH 6.5 to 8.0 range.</p><p>Circular Dichroism-Spectra were recorded at 20°C using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) calibrated with d-(ϩ)-10-camphor sulfonic acid ammonium salt. Far UV CD spectra were recorded between 190 and 270 nm using a 1-mm path length cell and a protein concentration of 6 M in buffers of pH 5.0 -8.0. Scans were recorded three times and averaged.</p><p>In Vitro Aggregation Assay-Recombinant proteins were concentrated using Centricon concentrators with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane (Amicon). Just before use, protein stocks were pre-spun for 30 min at 22,000 ϫ g; any pelleted material was discarded. A procedure similar to that previously described was employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Briefly, a 50-l sample of 0.2-0.5 mg/ml of recombinant protein in 5 mM HEPES, 10 mM MES (pH 7.5) was titrated to pH 5.5 by adding a pre-determined amount of 0.125 N HCl. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, samples were centrifuged at 50,000 ϫ g for 20 min in a TL100 ultracentrifuge to separate aggregates from soluble protein. The supernatants were removed and aliquots of the supernatants and the entire solubilized pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and band intensities were quantified using GeneTools software (Syngene).</p><p>Generation of Stable Cell Lines-Starting with the pCI-Neo-Kr PAM-1 vector, the Stratagene QuikChange protocol (La Jolla, CA) was used to replace His , His 366 , and His with Ala; the DNA sequence of the pCI-Neo-Kr PAM-1/H3A vector was verified. AtT-20 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 25 mM HEPES, 10% NuSerum, 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (pH 7.4). To establish stable AtT-20 cell lines expressing PAM-1/H3A, 70 -75% confluent cells in a T75 flask were transfected with 30 g of pCI-Neo-Kr PAM-1/H3A vector using Lipofectamine. After drug selection (0.5 mg/ml G-418) for 3 weeks, cells were subcloned by limiting dilution. Drug-resistant lines were selected based on their ability to secrete active PHM and were again subcloned by limiting dilution. Two stable clonal cell lines were chosen for further analysis.</p><p>Secretion of PAM Activity-To assess basal secretion, AtT-20 cells in 6-well plates were incubated in complete serum-free medium (CSFM) with 0.05 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (3 ml/well) for 24 h; spent medium was centrifuged to remove non-adherent cells and assayed for PHM activity. To measure secretagogue stimulation, cells were first rinsed with prewarmed CSFM, and then incubated in 2 ml of CSFM for two sequential 1-h basal secretion periods. Cells were then incubated in CSFM containing no secretogogue (basal), 2 mM BaCl 2 , or 1 M phorbol myristate acetate for 1 h; media were collected as before and cells were extracted into 20 mM NaTES, 10 mM mannitol, 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4 (TMT)) for measurement of enzyme activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. PAM activity was quantified using [ 125 I]-Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Gly; samples were assayed in duplicate after addition of optimal amounts of exogenous copper and ascorbate <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. For determining the optimum pH for maximum activity, the following buffers were mixed at 50 mM each and brought to the appropriate pH using either hydrochloric acid (pH 3.0) or sodium hydroxide (pH 3.5-8.0): homo-PIPES, MES, and HEPES.</p><p>Intracellular pH gradients were collapsed by treating PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells with alkalinizing drugs in complete serum-free medium for 24 h. Ammonium chloride and methylamine (Sigma) were used at 2.5 and 5 mM, respectively. Concanamycin A (Sigma) in dimethyl sulfoxide was used at 1 nM to block the vacuolar H ϩ -ATPase (V-ATPase); alkalinization was assessed in living drug-treated cells using acridine orange <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. After drug treatment, media were collected and cells were extracted into TMT as described above.</p><p>Immunofluorescence-Cells grown on glass chamber slides were rinsed with PBS (50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then sequentially incubated in PBS containing 0.075% Triton X-100 for 20 min at RT, PBS containing BSA (2 mg/ml) for 1 h, and PBS containing BSA and primary antibodies (diluted 1:1000) for 2 h. The primary antibodies used were: ␥MSH (JH189 (9)), C terminus of ACTH(1-39) (JH44 (36)), GM130 (Golgi marker; BD Biosciences), PHM (JH1761 (8)), PAL (JH256 (38)), PAM-CD (C-STOP, CT267 (39)), and exon 16 (JH629 (40)). Primary antibodies were visualized using Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (code 715-166-151; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (code 711-096-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Slides were mounted with glass coverslips using ProLong Gold antifade mounting agent (Invitrogen).</p><p>Cell Dimension Measurements-Phase-contrast images were taken under identical conditions using a ϫ20 objective and a Nikon TE300 microscope. Five individual images for each cell type (total 50 cells) were analyzed for total cell area, length, and breadth using image analysis software (NIS elements).</p><p>Electron Microscopy-For transmission electron microscopy cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraladehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide, dehydrated, and embedded in an Epon resin. Ultrathin sections were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and 30 Golgi complexes in each specimen were systematically sampled and photographed at ϫ6000 with a Jeol JEM-1400 electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Orius SC 1000B bottom mounted CCD camera.</p><p>For colloidal gold labeling at the electron microscope level, cells were incubated with antibody JH629 1:250 in DMEM/ HEPES/BSA for 30 min at 4°C, rinsed with DMEM/HEPES/ BSA at 4°C, incubated in DMEM/HEPES with protein A/15 nm colloidal gold (University of Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands) at the concentration suggested by the provider (1:60 -75) for 30 min at 4°C, rinsed in DMEM/HEPES at 4°C, and then chased in culture medium at 37°C. After the chase, cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and osmicated, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon as above. For classification of gold particles in multivesicular bodies, sections were systematically scanned to give 73 multivesicular bodies from two experiments in each cell line. Gold particles within 20 nm of the membrane of the multivesicular body were classified as external.</p><p>Immunoelectron Microscopy-Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at room temperature, scraped, pelleted, and embedded in gelatin. Polyvinylpyrrolidone/sucrose-infiltrated specimens were sectioned at Ϫ120°C; sections were collected with methyl cellulose/ sucrose, blocked with 1% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) and 1% BSA (Sigma), and incubated with antibody JH629 (1:2000) for 1 h followed by protein A/10 nm gold (University of Utrecht) for 1 h and embedded in uranyl acetate/methylcellulose. For double staining with the ACTH C-terminal antibody, internalized PAM antibody was first detected with protein A/10 nm gold; the sections were then fixed for 5 min with 1% glutaraldehyde to block background binding and then incubated with C-terminal ACTH antibody Kathy at 1:1000 (36) followed by protein A/15 nm gold.</p><p>Biosynthetic Labeling-Cell lines plated into 4-well dishes were allowed to reach 70 -80% confluence. After two 20-min rinses with CSFM/air (DMFM/F-12, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 g/ml of streptomycin, insulin/ transferrin/selenium, and 0.1 mg/ml of BSA), the cells were incubated in medium lacking Met for 5 min. The Met minus medium was replaced with Met minus medium containing [ 35 S]Met (1 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min, and cells were extracted immediately or chased for various times in CSFM/air containing Met. Cells were extracted into TMT for analysis of PAM and into 5 N acetic acid for analysis of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) products <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. Chase media were centrifuged to remove cell debris. PAM was immunoprecipitated using affinity purified JH1761, which binds to PHM. POMC proteins were immunoprecipitated using JH93, which recognizes the amino-terminal region of ACTH. To visualize newly synthesized proteins, immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE; gels were incubated with EnHANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and subjected to fluorography. Band intensities were quantified using GeneTools software and exposures in the linear range for quantification, and corrected for the number of Met residues in each protein or peptide.</p><p>Surface Biotinylation-Cell lines stably expressing PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A were incubated for 30 min in CSFM/air. Cells were rinsed with HSG buffer (15 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 4 mM KCl, 25 mM glucose, pH 7.5). For assessing steady state plasma membrane localization, surface biotinylation was carried out on ice and all solutions used were pre-chilled. For assessment of endocytic trafficking, surface biotinylation was carried out for 10 min at 37°C. Sulfo-NHS-LCbiotin (1.25 mM) (Pierce) dissolved in HSG buffer was applied on ice or at 37°C. The reaction was quenched by replacing the buffer with CSFM/air with 2 mg/ml of BSA for 5 min, followed by rinsing in CSFM/air. Cells were either extracted immediately or chased for up to 4 h by incubating in CSFM/air containing 1 mg/ml of BSA. Following extraction into TMT supplemented with protease inhibitors (30 g/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 g/ml of leupeptin, 10 g/ml of ␣-macroglobulin, and 16 g/ml of benzamidine) and centrifugation at 14,000 ϫ g for 20 min, clarified lysates and media were incubated with neutravidin beads (25 l of slurry) (Pierce) for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were rinsed twice with TMT containing protease inhibitors and once with buffer lacking detergent before eluting the bound proteins into Laemmli sample buffer by heating for 5 min at 95°C. Eluates were analyzed on 4 -15% gradient gels. Band intensities were quantified using GeneTools software and exposures in the linear range for quantification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>His Cluster Imparts pH Sensitivity to Non-catalytic PAM Linker Region-The protease-resistant catalytic core of PHM (PHMcc) is followed by a well conserved cluster of three His residues <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, A and B)</ref>. This His cluster is included in the final exon (rat exon 13; exon 14 is included only in a rare splice variant) encoding PHMcc and is followed by a poorly conserved, protease-sensitive region encoded by a short exon present in each of the major splice variants of PAM (rat exon 15). The non-catalytic linker region between PHM and PAL can end at exon 15, as in PAM-2, or can include a 315-nt exon (rat exon 16), as in PAM-1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, A and B)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. Exon 16 plays an important role in PAM-1 trafficking and in the ability of PAM-1 to participate in transmembrane signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. To test the hypothesis that these His residues serve as a pH sensor, all three were mutated to Ala. The effects of this change were first evaluated in the context of the linker region alone; purified GST fusion proteins encoding the wild-type linker (WT linker) and the mutated linker (H3A linker) were cleaved and ion exchange chromatography was used to purify both proteins <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C)</ref>.</p><p>The effect of pH on the far UV CD spectrum of each protein was determined ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A)</ref>. At physiological pH, the CD spectrum, with a negative maximum () at 200 nm, revealed the unstructured nature of this region. NMR analysis of 15 N-labeled WT linker also indicated that the majority of backbone protons and carbons exhibited chemical shifts characteristic of random-coil configurations at pH 7 (results not shown). The far UV CD spectrum of the WT linker was pH sensitive; [] 200 nm was less negative at pH 5 (Ϫ16,100 deg cm 2 dmol Ϫ1 ) than at pH (Ϫ28,150 deg cm dmol Ϫ1 ). The plot of [] 200 nm versus pH revealed a half-maximal effect at approximately pH 6.5, consistent with a role for His protonation in the response. Consistent with this suggestion, the far UV CD spectrum of the H3A linker was not altered when the pH was dropped from pH 7.0 to pH 5.0; [] 200 nm was Ϫ27,500 deg cm dmol Ϫ1 at both pH values ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A)</ref>. The presence of two Trp residues in exon 16 allowed us to use endogenous fluorescence to search for pH-dependent structural changes in the WT linker. The wavelength of the maximum fluorescence intensity peak for WT linker shifted from 344 to 336 nm as the pH was decreased from pH 8.0 to 5.0. The maximum fluorescence intensity peak for the H3A linker was much less sensitive to changes in pH over this range <ref type="figure">(Fig.  2B</ref>).</p><p>Several secretory granule content proteins aggregate at mildly acidic pH in the presence of calcium, a milieu thought to represent the lumen of the TGN (1). When purified PAM-3, a soluble form of bifunctional PAM was tested for its ability to aggregate through in vitro assays, it showed a strong homophilic aggregation (35%, at pH 5.8) when mixed with globin and more extensive aggregation when mixed with adrenal chromaffin granule proteins (55% at pH 5.8) (1). We tested the ability of recombinant WT and H3A linker to aggregate under similar conditions ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2C)</ref>. A pH 7.5 stock solution of each purified protein was left untouched or titrated to pH 5.5; protein that precipitated during a 1-h incubation at 37°C was recovered in the pellet fractions after centrifugation. The extent of aggregation and its dependence on pH were diminished in H3A linker assayed in the same manner. As much as 11% of the WT linker precipitated at pH 5.5, whereas only 6% of the H3A linker precipitated under these conditions ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2D)</ref>.</p><p>PAM-1/H3A and PAM-1 in HEK293 Cells-We next introduced the same His mutations into PAM-1 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A)</ref> and stably expressed the protein in HEK293 cells to evaluate its catalytic activity and in AtT-20 cells to evaluate its processing, trafficking, and ability to alter the function of the regulated secretory FIGURE 2. His cluster in WT linker is responsible for its pH-dependent properties. A, a concentrated stock of purified recombinant protein was diluted to 6 M with 20 mM buffers varying in pH and incubated for 2 h before recording far UV-CD spectra. Representative far UV CD spectra for WT and H3A linker proteins are shown for pH 5.0 and 7.0. Inset shows pH-dependent changes monitored by changes in ellipticity () at ϭ 200 nm for the WT and H3A linkers. Values were averaged from three independent experiments.

Western blot analysis of total cell lysates using an affinity purified antibody specific for PHM (JH 1761) identified a single protein of the same mass (120 kDa) in both samples. B, the pH optimum for PHM in lysates of PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A HEK293 cells was assessed by measuring activity from pH 3.0 to 8.0; maximal PHM activity was set to 100% to facilitate comparison between PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A. The slight decrease in PHM activity in the pH 5 to 7 range was seen consistently. Inset, the specific activities of PHM and PAL in these Triton X-100-solubilized crude particulate fractions at their optimum pH (4.5) was compared by normalizing activity to the amount of PAM protein estimated by Western blot analysis using an antibody to PHM (n ϭ 3 for B and inset). C, stable AtT-20 lines expressing PAM-1 or PAM-1/H3A were fixed and stained simultaneously for PAM (6E6, specific for the C terminus of PAM) and ACTH (JH44, specific for the C terminus of ACTH). Cell morphology differed substantially, but PAM was largely localized to the TGN area in both lines; whereas ACTH accumulated in the TGN area in PAM-1 cells, ACTH was more prevalent at the tips of the long processes typically seen in PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells. D, equal amounts of protein (5 g) from PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and PAM was visualized using antibodies specific for the indicated regions. Steady state levels of sPHM were lower in PAM-1/H3A cells than in PAM-1 cells.

In addition to sPHM, medium samples contained sPAM. G, the basal secretion rate of sPHM, which is produced only in the regulated secretory pathway, was calculated from these Western blots (% ϭ 100 ϫ sPHM mdm /(sPHM cell ϩ PAM-1 cell )) and was significantly higher in PAM-1/H3A cells than in PAM-1 cells (*, p Ͻ 0.05; n ϭ 6).</p><p>reticular pattern resembling that of the Golgi complex.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Histidine Cluster Imparts pH Sensing Capability to PAM Linker-As the only amino acid with a titratable side chain pK a in the physiological range, His residues are known to play a key role in the many cellular events regulated by pH; clusters of His residues or single His residues can serve this purpose. A single His residue controls the interaction of lysosomal membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2) with its lysosomal cargo protein, ␤-glucocerebrosidase <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>, and a single His residue serves as the pH sensor that regulates furin activation in the secretory pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>. As the key regulator of luminal pH, the vacuolar H ϩ -ATPase would be expected to sense pH and relay this information to the appropriate cytosolic machinery <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. Five of the 21 luminal His residues in the a2-subunit of mouse V-ATPase are needed to sense endosomal pH and trigger the conformational change that transmits this information to its cytoplasmic domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Similarly, ␣ viruses like Semliki Forest virus use a His residue to regulate the low pH-dependent refolding of E1 to trigger virus-membrane fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(62)</ref>.</p><p>In earlier studies, we used epitope masking to determine that soluble and membrane forms of PAM exhibit a conformational change between pH 7.5 and 5.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref>. The presence of a conserved cluster of His residues in the linker region of mammalian and Xenopus PAM led us to investigate the possibility that this region could serve as a pH sensor; if the single His residues found in Acropora, Schistosoma, and Chlamydomonas PAM serve a similar function, this role is ancient <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>. Although the structures of the catalytic cores of rat PHM and PAL have been determined, far UV CD and NMR analyses both indicate that its linker region is unstructured in the buffers used and attempts to crystallize bifunctional PAM have not yet met with success.</p><p>Based on a decrease in negative ellipticity and a blue-shift in the max for intrinsic Trp fluorescence, recombinant wild-type PAM linker responds to a shift from pH 7 to 5; this response is lost in the H3A linker. Unfolding and refolding studies of bovine serum albumin showed a similar dip in ellipticity at acid pH, reflecting protein compressibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref>. The decreased negative ellipticity and blue-shifted max observed upon protonation of His residues in the WT linker suggest that its structure is more tightly packed at low pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>.</p><p>The decrease in luminal pH as proteins move from the Golgi through the TGN and into immature secretory granules is known to contribute to the aggregation of cargo proteins entering the regulated secretory pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65)</ref>. Purified WT linker is more susceptible to low pH-induced aggregation than H3A linker, suggesting that it could contribute to this process. In test tube assays, purified soluble PAM-3 undergoes pH-dependent aggregation (1). PAM in pituitary and adrenal lysates, which interacts with other cargo proteins, also aggregates at low pH (1). In the presence of trifluoroethanol, WT linker acquires more helical structure (data not shown); additional studies will be required to determine the effect of pH on the structure of the linker region when constrained by its attachment to PHM and PAL in PAM-3 and PAM-1.</p><p>Like PAM-1, PAM-1/H3A exhibited maximal PHM activity at pH 4.5, although its specific activity was diminished by a factor of about two <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3)</ref>; the decrease in specific activity could reflect an increased level of immature PAM-1/H3A protein due to its limited endocytosis. It is our hypothesis that PAM-1/H3A, like the H3A linker, loses the ability to respond normally to pH values that drop below pH 7.</p><p>PAM-1/H3A Is Less Sensitive to pH Gradient Dissipation Than PAM-1-Acidification of secretory granules is crucial to the proteolytic processing of prohormones and their processing enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67)</ref>. A clear role for the PAM-1 His cluster in responding to luminal pH is supported by the ability of both NH 4 Cl/methylamine and concanamycin treatment to diminish sPHM levels in PAM-1, but not in PAM-1/H3A, cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6C)</ref>. The V-ATPase acts as a proton pump and as a pH sensor, relay-ing luminal pH information to cytosolic interactors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59)</ref>. The interaction of the V-ATPase with Arf6 and ARNO depends on luminal acidification and is important for budding and endosome-derived carrier-vesicle formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. The increased accumulation of sPAM in concanamycin, but not in NH 4 Cl/methylamine, treated PAM-1 cells indicates that this response is not solely due to altered luminal pH; concanamycin was without effect on sPAM levels in PAM-1/H3A cells, perhaps because internalized PAM-1/H3A enters a degradative compartment instead of entering multivesicular bodies <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6,  A and B)</ref>. PAM-1/H3A cells secreted sPHM more quickly than PAM-1 cells, but sPHM secretion by both cell lines was decreased following prolonged exposure to NH 4 Cl/methylamine or concanamycin <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6D)</ref>; this result indicates that additional regions of PAM-1 contribute to its pH sensitivity.</p><p>Role of His Cluster in PAM Trafficking-Metabolic labeling studies indicated that newly synthesized PAM-1 and PAM-1/ H3A first enter a cleavage competent compartment at the same time. Newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A is more likely to undergo degradation and soluble PHM/H3A is more likely to undergo basal secretion. Earlier studies demonstrated that PAM-4, a natural splice variant that encodes a soluble PHM protein that includes the His cluster, is stored more efficiently in regulated secretory granules than PHMcc, which lacks the His cluster <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52)</ref>. The diminished ability of PHM/H3A to enter the regulated secretory pathway is also reflected in its increased basal secretion from PAM-1/H3A cells. As discussed below, the enhanced ability of secretagogues to stimulate secretion of the PHM/H3A that is stored in mature secretory granules reflects the inability of PAM-1/H3A to signal normally.</p><p>Very little PAM-1 is localized to the plasma membrane at steady state; antibody uptake and surface biotinylation experiments have demonstrated its rapid endocytosis, trafficking through multivesicular bodies and return to the regulated secretory pathway or degradation. Phosphorylation of multiple sites in the unstructured cytosolic domain of PAM governs the fate of internalized PAM-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. After endocytosis, endoproteolytic cleavage of PAM-1 at a site close to its transmem-brane domain produces sPAM and an ϳ19-kDa C-terminal fragment. Both metabolic labeling and surface biotinylation revealed the almost total absence of sPAM/H3A in PAM-1/ H3A cells. Consistent with these biochemical measurements, immunoelectron microscopy revealed diminished levels of internalized PAM-1/H3A in multivesicular bodies and their intraluminal vesicles. Lacking access to its normal endocytic trafficking pathway, internalized PAM-1/H3A is rapidly degraded. The trafficking of PAM-1 through multivesicular bodies is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser 949 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. Our data suggest that a conformational change triggered by the His cluster when internalized PAM-1 reaches an appropriately acidified endosome plays an essential role in its endocytic trafficking.</p><p>As predicted by the lack of generation of sPAM/H3A in PAM-1/H3A cells, very little 19-kDa C-terminal fragment is created <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 7B)</ref>. ␥-Secretase catalyzed intramembrane prote- AtT-20 cells were incubated with [ 35 S]Met for 30 min; cells and media were harvested immediately (Pulse) or after a 1-, 2-, or 4-h chase; ACTH-containing peptides were immunoprecipitated using an antibody specific for the N-terminal region of ACTH (JH93). Expression of PAM-1 reduced POMC cleavage and increased secretion of ACTH biosynthetic intermediate (ABI). In non-transfected and PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells, POMC was cleaved into ACTH and glycosylated ACTH (gACTH), which were both secreted. A schematic showing the major POMC cleavage products is shown; the antibody used for immunoprecipitation detects POMC, ABI, gACTH, and ACTH. B, non-transfected, PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells were incubated with control medium (Basal) or challenged with medium containing 2 mM BaCl 2 for 30 min; cell lysates and aliquots of medium were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for the ␥MSH region of POMC (JH189). BaCl 2 stimulated the secretion of the 16-kDa fragment by non-transfected and PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells; in contrast, little stimulation of the 16-kDa fragment secretion was observed in PAM-1 AtT-20 cells. C, JH 189 signals at steady state in the cell extracts for intact POMC and 16-kDa fragment were quantified and expressed as percentage of 16-kDa fragment to intact POMC; n ϭ 3. D, graph shows percentage of 16-kDa fragment in the medium to its basal cell content in non-transfected, WT, and H3A cells. Experiments were repeated twice with duplicates. Data were analyzed using two-tailed t test assuming unequal variance; error bars indicate S.D. *, p Ͻ 0.05, n ϭ 3. E, a pH-dependent conformational change in the luminal domain of PAM alters the ability of its unstructured, multiply phosphorylated C-terminal region to interact with cytosolic proteins.</p><p>olysis of the 19-and 22/24-kDa TMD/CD fragments of PAM-1 generates sf-CD. This fragment accumulates in the nucleus in a phosphorylation state-dependent manner and is thought to play a role in controlling gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. The inability of PAM-1/H3A to traverse the endocytic pathway normally largely eliminates production of sf-CD <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 7, A and B)</ref>.</p><p>Role of PAM His Cluster in Signaling-Using a doxycycline inducible system to control PAM-1 expression in AtT-20 cells, we demonstrated that expression of PAM-1 causes changes in gene expression, inhibits POMC processing, reduces the ability of secretagogue to stimulate secretory granule exocytosis, and alters cytoskeletal organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>. Expression of similar levels of PAM-1/H3A does not alter POMC processing, secretagogue responsiveness, or cytoskeletal organization. These differences could be a direct reflection of the altered properties of PAM-1/H3A or an indirect effect of the inability of PAM-1/ H3A to traffic normally, generate sf-CD, and alter gene expression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10E)</ref>.</p><p>Because mutating the His cluster in the linker region of PAM-1 would be expected to result in a loss-of-function phenotype, we conclude that one of the normal roles of PAM is to serve as a pH sensor in the regulated secretory pathway and in the endocytic pathway. The inability of low luminal pH to alter the conformation of the cytosolic domain of PAM-1/H3A as it traverses specific subcellular locations could alter its ability to interact with essential cytosolic proteins like Kalirin and Uhmk1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Lacking the ability to traverse the endocytic pathway, PAM-1/H3A may never be exposed to the enzymes that allow PAM-1 to undergo the sequential cleavages needed to produce sf-CD and signal from the lumen to the cytosol. Using antisera specific to Ser(P) <ref type="bibr">937</ref> and Thr(P) <ref type="bibr">946</ref> , Ser(P) 949 , we were unable to detect changes in the steady state phosphorylation of PAM-1/H3A, but changes in phosphorylation at specific subcellular locations may occur.</p><p>Like PAM-1/H3A, PAM-1 proteins bearing cytosolic domain mutations that eliminate their ability to interact with Uhmk-1 (K919R; L926Q; F929A,F930A), a Ser/Thr protein kinase that phosphorylates Ser 949 , lose their ability to alter regulated secretion and cytoskeletal organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref>. Although PAM-1/ K919R and PAM-1/F929A,F930A generate normal amounts of sf-CD, altered sf-CD phosphorylation would be expected to alter its ability to signal. Due to the presence of different interactors, a pH-dependent conformational change in the linker domain of PAM-1 that is entering immature secretory granules may trigger a different cytosolic response than a pH-dependent conformational change that occurs when PAM-1 is traversing the endocytic pathway.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The PAM linker region includes a conserved His cluster.

The increasing levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere trap more and more heat, warming the atmosphere and the ocean. The IPCC, (2014) revealed that the global average temperature of seawater has risen by at least 0.7 ˚C over the two and a half centuries.</p><p>At the same time, the increase in atmospheric CO 2 has caused dissolution of 550 billion tons of atmospheric CO 2 in global oceans, resulting in an increase of ocean acidity (pH is reduced from 8.2 to 8.1) in a process known as ocean acidification (OA) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Sabine et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Feely et al., 2009)</ref>.

It is clear from the literature that the ocean warming and ocean acidification are the two main drivers of anthropogenic climate change and have deleterious effects on marine biological processes. In general, ocean warming has received a lot of attention in the aquaculture sector, but acidification has received relatively less attention. Recently, the effects of seawater warming on bivalve aquaculture have been reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Tan and Zheng (2019)</ref>. On the other hand, for OA, although there are many time series observations and climate stimulation experiments on the effects of OA on bivalves, the information is not organized. Therefore, a rigorous scientific review is needed to summarize and interpret the impact of OA on bivalve aquaculture. This information will aid in establishing aquaculture and fishery management plans to be implemented in both commercial fisheries and nature conservations. To the best of our knowledge, this article represents the first review that summarizes the potential impacts of OA on bivalve aquaculture based on available scientific evidence and to discuss the future direction of bivalve farming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.0">Ocean Acidification</head><p>In the past 23 million years, the concentration of atmospheric CO has remained in the range of 140 to 280 ppm, and the surface ocean pH has remained consistent from pH 8.1 to 8.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Pearson and Palmer, 2000)</ref>. However, since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the past 200 years, CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and deforestation have led to a dramatic increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations from 280 ppm to 380 ppm (TansNOAA/ESRLrecords). In order to meet the new equilibrium of carbon, some atmospheric CO 2 (about 550 billion tons of atmospheric CO 2 ) is dissolved in the world's oceans, changing seawater carbon chemistry and acidifying the oceans <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Doney et al., 2009)</ref>. To date, ocean pH has been reduced by 0.1 units with an increase in acidity (H + ) of about 30% <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Feely et al., 2009)</ref>. It is predicted that the ocean pH will be further reduced by approximately 0.32 units in 2100, and this pH reduction is equivalent to a 150% increase in ocean acidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(IPCC, 2007)</ref>. According to climate model projections, <ref type="bibr">Queiros et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Gattuso and Hansson (2011)</ref> predicted that the ocean pH will reach pH 7.4 by 2300. Higherlatitude systems typically have low buffering capacity to resist acidity changes, therefore, OA has a greater impact on high latitude temperate waters than in tropical waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Lough and Hobday, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">IPCC, 2007)</ref>. In fact, multiple lines of evidence have confirmed a significant pH drop in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Thornalley et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Levin, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brennan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gilbert et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the climate change model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Feely et al. (2009)</ref> predicted that OA may last for hundreds of years. The steady increase in dissolution of atmospheric CO 2 in the upper water column have increased the prevalence of aragonite saturation (Ω ar ) &lt; 1 in the water of world oceans <ref type="bibr">(Bednarsek et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Freely et al., 2008)</ref>. Compared to preindustrial, surface oceans have now lost approximately 16% of CO 3 - <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Sabine et al., 2004)</ref>, which reduced the availability of suitable habitats for bivalve and increased vulnerability of bivalves to stressors <ref type="bibr">(Bednarsek et al., 2014)</ref>. The current level of OA in the Pacific Northwest of the United States has resulted in an annual economical loss of $270 million Washington's bivalve aquaculture industry (Washington State Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification, 2012). On the other hand, although the impact of OA has not been felt in many places, the OA problem has received considerable attention worldwide. Moreover, regions experiencing seasonal upwelling are particularly vulnerable to OA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hauri et al. (2013)</ref> demonstrated that the early spring equatorial wind caused seasonal upwelling in California Current System (CCS), which led to natural low pH and aragonite saturation in CCS.</p></div>

There are indications that microbial communities of Vibrio population may increase at lower pH values <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Meron et al., 2012)</ref> due to the wide optimum pH (pH 6.5 to 8.2) of Vibrios growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Wang and Gu, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dorfmeier, (2012)</ref> demonstrated that in extreme scenarios of elevated pCO 2 (2000 ppm), the growth and abundance of V. tubiashii in C. gigas larvae were significantly higher than that of ambient pCO 2 levels. Moreover, heterotrophic bacteria tend to produce more proteases <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Grossart et al., 2006)</ref> and glycosidases <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Piontek et al., 2010)</ref> at lower pH, where these enzymes play an important role in the degradation of organic compounds, thereby promoting the growth of heterotrophic marine bacteria communities. In addition, higher productions of proteases and glycosidases may also be associated with higher virulence of pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Ridgway et al., 2008)</ref>. Laboratory studies revealed that acidic conditions can enhance the virulence of Virio harveyi, and the survival rate and haemolytic activity of V. harveyi were significantly higher in the haemolymph of blood clam, Tegillarca granosa under OA conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Zha et al., 2017)</ref>. However, the effect of OA on pathogen virulence is highly species-specific, and some V. tubiashii strains have lower pathogenicity to C.</p><p>gigas larvae under ocean acidification conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Malek et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Immunity is energetically costly for the host, in which the energy available for immune responses might reduce if the bivalve is exposed to acidified conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Siva-Jothy et al. 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Wang et al. (2016)</ref> reported that exposure of Crassostrea gigas to OA (at about 2000 ppm pCO 2 ) for 28 days not only increased apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in hemocytes, but also reduced the level of some antioxidant enzymes and glutathione in the hemocytes and digestive gland, respectively. It has also been suggested that OA may hamper the immunity of marine bivalves by negatively affecting immune related signaling pathways and limiting the energy allocation for immune responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Su et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Liu et al., 2016)</ref>. In the V. parahaemolyticus challenge experiment, the antibacterial capacity in gills of Mytilus edulis that pre-exposed to acidified seawater (pH 7.7) for four months was significantly lower than that that of the control mussels maintained at pH 8.1 <ref type="bibr">(Hernroth et al., 2016)</ref>. Similarly, other laboratory studies have also revealed that the antibacterial capacity of My. edulis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asplund et al., 2013)</ref> and T. granosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Zha et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asplund et al., 2014)</ref> were significantly impaired in acidified seawater when challenged with V. tubiashii and V. harveyi, respectively. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Matozzo et al. (2012)</ref> reported that the effect of OA on the haemocyte functionality in bivalves is species-specific, and Chamelea gallina appear to be more susceptable to OA than My. galloprovincialis <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Matozzo et al., 2012)</ref>. In addition to lowering the haemocyte functionality, acidified seawater has also been shown to reduce the total haemocyte count and cell type composition of haemocyte in Pinctada fucata <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Li et al., 2015)</ref> and T. granosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Su et al., 2017)</ref>. As a result, the weakened immunity of bivalves in future climate scenarios may be beneficial for invading bacteria in infecting hosts. In addition, in high densities bivalve farms, bivalves are more vulnerable to OA due to bacteria can easily spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Tan and Zheng, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In some circumstances, OA did not significantly affect bivalve immunity, but these conditions may alter host-pathogen interactions and favoring the pathogens infection to some extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Asplund et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dorfmeier, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asplund et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metamorphosis</head><p>Bivalves are particularly susceptible to OA because elevated seawater pCO 2 reduces the CaCO 3 saturation of aragonite and calcite (Varag or Vcalc), which negatively affects the calcification and growth of marine bivalves <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Kroeker et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">(Kroeker et al., , 2013</ref> ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Gazeau et al. (2007)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Ries et al. (2009)</ref> revealed that the net calcification of blue mussels and scallops reduced by 25% and 10%, respectively, in the case of elevated pCO 2 conditions predicted in 2100. Moreover, embryonic growth of C. gigas <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kurihara et al., 2007)</ref> and My. edulis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gazeau et al., 2010)</ref> at pH 7.4 was significantly lower than that in ambient seawater pH, where pH and aragonite saturation state have no effect on embryonic development, but the reduced carbonate ions (CO 3 2-) level was responsible for lower embryonic development <ref type="bibr">(Gazeau et al., 2011</ref>). Contrary to the findings of other studies, protein expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dineshram et al., 2012</ref>) and metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Lannig et al., 2010)</ref> in C. gigas can be depressed at pH &lt; 7.5. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Melzner et al. (2011)</ref> revealed that acidified seawater introduces additional energy costs and significantly lowered the growth and development of bivalves, particularly in the case of food depletion. On average, <ref type="bibr">Kroeker et al. (2013)</ref> estimated that bivalves will reduce calcification and growth rates by 27% and 11%, respectively, in response to the near future acidification scenarios.</p><p>The larval stage, particularly during the development of the first shell, called prodissoconch I (PDI), is the most fragile developmental stage of bivalves because of their high energetic costs for organogenesis, rapid calcification rates, and greater exposure of surfaces (total area per unit volume) to the external environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Rumrill, 1990)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Watson et al. (2009)</ref> revealed that in acidified seawater (pH 7.8 and 7.6), the survival, growth and development of Saccostrea glomerata larvae were significantly lower than those maintained at ambient water pH, in which S. glomerata larval survival, antero-posterior measurement (APM) and dorso-ventral measurement (DVM) at pH 7.8 and 7.6 decreased by 43% and 72%, 6.3% and 8.7%, and 5.1% and 7.5%, respectively. For C. virginica larvae, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Miller et al. (2009)</ref> observed that only the growth rate was significantly lowered in acidified seawater, but the effect of OA on survival was relatively small. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Talmage and Gobler (2009)</ref> observed a decreased in the growth rate and survival rate of C. virginica larvae, which had a negative effect on the metamorphosis in response to acidified seawater. Regardless of the species-specific response to OA, all of these studies generally indicate that the growth and survival of bivalve larvae are adversely affected by OA conditions.</p><p>Metamorphosis from larvae to juvenile is another critical stage, in which larvae must rely on endogenous energy for the metamorphosis. On the one hand, bivalve larvae tend to have reduced lipid levels under acidification stress, which leads to greater metamorphosis and settlement failure <ref type="bibr">Gobler, 2011, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, calcification of newly settled juvenile bivalves is more sensitive to acidification, which further increases the mortality rate of newly settle juvenile bivalves <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Waldbusser et al., 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Talmage and Gobler (2010)</ref> revealed that the freshly settled Mercenaria mercenaria and Argopecten irradians exhibited lower growth and survival rates even at moderately elevated pCO 2 of below 1500 µatm. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Watson et al. (2012)</ref> revealed that T. squamosal exhibited &lt;20% survival rate at a relatively lower pCO 2 of 1019 μatm. Similarly, C. gigas larvae that spawned and reared in acidified seawater for the first 48 h demonstrated that the hatching rate and midstage growth rate (120 to 150 mm) of oyster larvae was inversely correlated to the aragonite saturation state of water <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barton et al., 2012)</ref>. This can partly explain the recruitment failures of Pacific oysters in Willapa Bay, Washington, for years <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dumbauld et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>It is worth noting that the response of bivalves to pCO 2 rise is species-specific, and some bivalve species show little or no negative response to OA <ref type="bibr">(Walbusser et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Beesley et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Portner, 2008)</ref>. For instance, although the embryonic growth of C. gigas <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Kurihara et al., 2007)</ref> and My. edulis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Gazeau et al., 2010)</ref> appears to be affected by acidified seawater (pH 7.4), but metabolism  and tissue condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Beesley et al., 2008)</ref> appear to be unaffected. <ref type="bibr">Interestingly, Walbusser et al.

In general, the effect of OA on bivalve shells varies considerably across species and life stages <ref type="bibr">(Gazeau et al., 2013)</ref>. For C. virginica, OA has been shown to reduce shell length and shell thickness in larval individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gobler and Talmage, 2014)</ref> and to reduce calcification rates in juveniles <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Waldbusser et al., 2011)</ref> and adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Ries et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In general, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Kleypas et al.

It is worth noting that IMTA can be applied not only to marine environment, but also to the hatchery system, in which the incoming seawater is first treated (buffer low pH seawater) with macroalgae or microalgae and then supplied to the shellfish tanks. As the result, IMTA can effectively reduce the impact of OA in bivalve farms, and farmed bivalves can gradually acclimate/adapt to changes in carbonate chemistry.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.0">Discussion</head><p>In the world of aquaculture, changes in marine environmental conditions caused by anthropogenic climate change have become a prime issue and have received considerable attention. There is growing evidence from laboratory experiments and time series observations that the additive stressors of ocean acidification and global warming are particularly problematic for marine life. Acidification has been shown to negatively affect the recruitment, development <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Parker et al., 2009)</ref>, growth and survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Tan and Zheng, 2019;</ref> of marine bivalves. <ref type="bibr">Shi et al.

The calcification process of bivalve is strongly influence by the water pH <ref type="bibr">(Gazeau et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Waldbusser et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, for many bivalve species, shell growth and integrity are compromised <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dorfmeier 2012)</ref>, and increased vulnerability to diseases and parasites under more acidic conditions, resulting in higher levels of mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barton et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Green et al., 2013)</ref>. Since the effects of OA on shell growth and development are also associated with water temperature and other parameters, there are potential synergies among multiple environmental changes associated with climate change, where the combined effects of two or more drivers on species may be worse than the additive influence of the individual factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Tan and Zheng, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brook et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>However, some studies have shown that the presence of a second driver may reduce the impact of another stressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Crain et al., 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Kroeker et al. (2014)</ref> reported that warming can reduce the effects of OA on bivalves by altering the physiology of bivalves and seawater geochemistry, with the negative impact of OA (1200 µatm CO 2 ) on My. galloprovincialis growth is gradually lessened with successive warming from 14 to 20 ˚C. Furthermore, warmer conditions stimulate the growth of bivalve shells, which is independent of CO 2 treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brook et al., 2008)</ref>. Caution though, it is worth noting that most of the above mentioned effects of climate change on cultured shellfish are derived from laboratory experiments. Many studies are short term and use acute exposure. It may not reflect how bivalves are exposed in an OA environment. Therefore, more chronic exposure experiments or field observations are required to provide a more accurate prediction of the fate of bivalves in the future ocean.</p><p>In the footsteps of global warming, on the one hand, alterations of seawater salinity have attracted considerable attention, mainly in the estuary and coastal areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kay et al., 2006)</ref>. Global warming is associated to changes in the global hydrological cycle, where precipitation in high latitudes and tropical regions may be higher, while precipitation in subtropical and mid-latitude regions is reduced, thereby drought or flooding will occur in many areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Fenoglio et al., 2010)</ref>. In the estuaries where frequent flood events occur, prolonged and more frequent periods of reduced salinity are expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bussell et al., 2008)</ref>. On the other hand, it is widely believed that the dissolved oxygen (O 2 ) concentrations in the global ocean decline as the seawater temperature increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Long et al, 2016)</ref>. Deoxygenation rate vary from region to region, and the northwest Atlantic coastal waters has shown long-term deoxygenation trends over the past century <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brennan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gilbert et al., 2005)</ref> far exceeding the average deoxygenation rate in the global and North Atlantic basin <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Levin, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Palaeoceanographic records of the past millennium documented warming, salinification and changing nutrient supply on the Scotian Shelf during the past century <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Thornalley et al., 2018)</ref>, where these coastal changes may reflect variations in large-scale offshore circulation that transports well-oxygenated water masses to the south (Labrador Current) and oxygen-deficient water masses from tropical and subtropical to northern regions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Sherwood et al., 2011)</ref>.

Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) approach is indeed relevant to all bivalve species in all regions, as it helps mitigate the effects of climate change and allows the bivalves to gradually adapt to slower ocean changing conditions. With the help of IMTA, small sizes bivalve species with shorter generation times may have promising capacity for transgenerational acclimation to changing ocean pCO2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Miller et al., 2009)</ref>. However, for some bivalve species with long maturity time and generational periods, especially giant clams, the ability to acclimation and adaptation in the next 100 years may be reduced.

Other important areas of future genetic breeding research include reducing metabolic rate and increasing the tolerance of bivalves to low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions. It has been reported that by reducing the energetic burden of acidification, slow shell building and decreased metabolism rate are one of the effective ways of bivalve tolerance to OA <ref type="bibr">(Walbusser et al., 2016)</ref>. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Schmidtko et al.

More studies are highly recommended to identify other climate change resilience traits to facilitate transgenerational acclimation or evolution of aquaculture important mollusc species to tolerate the changing ocean conditions.

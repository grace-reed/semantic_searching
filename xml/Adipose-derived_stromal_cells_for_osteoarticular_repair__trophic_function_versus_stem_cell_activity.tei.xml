			<abstract>
				<p>The identification of multipotent adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC) has raised hope that tissue regeneration approaches established with bone-marrowderived stromal cells (BMSC) can be reproduced with a cell-type that is far more accessible in large quantities. Recent detailed comparisons, however, revealed subtle functional differences between ASC and BMSC, stressing the concept of a common mesenchymal progenitor existing in a perivascular niche across all tissues. Focussing on bone and cartilage repair, this review summarises recent in vitro and in vivo studies aiming towards tissue regeneration with ASC. Advantages of good accessibility, high yield and superior growth properties are counterbalanced by an inferiority of ASC to form ectopic bone and stimulate long-bone healing along with their less pronounced osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression signature. Hence, particular emphasis is placed on establishing whether stem cell activity of ASC is so far proven and relevant for successful osteochondral regeneration, or whether trophic activity may largely determine therapeutic outcome.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Established strategies for cartilage and bone repair, such as autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) (Ref. 1) and bone grafting (Ref. 2), have reached broad clinical application and yield satisfactory results due to continuous improvement. These therapies, however, require the excision of healthy tissue from a nonlesioned site, necessarily incorporating the disadvantages of additional medical procedures, donor site morbidity and further rehabilitative burden on the patient (Ref. 3). Repair strategies that are based on autologous bone-marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSC) do not circumvent these problems, but harvesting bone marrow from the iliac crest is generally judged as less invasive <ref type="bibr">(Ref. 4)</ref>. The discovery that multipotent stromal cells can be isolated from lipoaspirates <ref type="bibr">(Ref. 5)</ref> and that the number of adherent cells in an equal volume of adipose tissue exceeds the content of bone marrow aspirate by about 300-fold (Refs 6, 7, 8) challenged the assumption that bone marrow would be the most appropriate source for cellbased therapies of skeletal injuries and diseases.</p><p>In order to verify whether adipose-derived stromal cells (ASC) represent an easily accessible cell type that may substitute for BMSC completely in cell-based approaches for osteochondral regeneration, they were characterised in terms of in vitro performance (Refs 9, 10), in vivo localisation <ref type="bibr">(Refs 11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12)</ref> and their ability to differentiate into various mesenchymal cell types <ref type="bibr">(Refs 13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16)</ref>. This review summarises current knowledge of ASC and BMSC plasticity and in vivo function, describing similarities and differences between both cell types that have been determined upon expansion. Furthermore, an overview is provided on osteoarticular regenerative approaches that have thus far been conducted using ASC. In summary, data on ASC-based osteoarticular repair strategies indicate that ASC do not possess intrinsic osteochondral potential, such as BMSC, but require reprogramming for in vivo development towards the osteochondral lineage. These observations stress the concept of equivalent mesenchymal progenitors in bone marrow and adipose tissue <ref type="bibr">(Ref. 8)</ref>. In view of a long list of successful experimental intervention studies in distinct models, trophic functions of ASC may be more relevant than stem cell potential in mediating osteoarticular repair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stemness of BMSC and ASC Criteria for stem cell definition</head><p>Thus far absent from the literature is a comprehensive, general convention that defines intrinsic properties for stem cells of any given tissue <ref type="bibr">(Ref. 17)</ref>. From a functional point of view, a well-accepted interpretation would be that a single stem cell possesses the capacity to build up a physiological, multicellular tissue that is capable of autonomous regeneration in vivo. Specific cellular functions such as asymmetric cell division, prolonged self-renewal and differentiation capacities are needed to fulfil this requirement. Most importantly, in vitro detection of these properties in a particular cell type alone, however, does not necessarily prove stemness. It is self-explanatory that a stem cell only deserves this designation if the observed fundamental capacities represent intrinsic features of the native cell in vivo, rather than being achieved by artificial treatments or molecular reprogramming. These stringent criteria for stem cell definition (Ref. 18) are met by haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which reconstitute bone marrow when clonally derived HSC are transplanted into lethally irradiated mice <ref type="bibr">(Ref. 19</ref>). In the context of osteoarticular repair, BMSC are so far the only entity representing skeletal stem cells, according to this stringent definition. Sacchetti et al. established that clonal BMSC populations are self-renewing and can form an ectopic bone organ after subcutaneous transplantation into immunocompromised mice <ref type="bibr">(Ref. 20)</ref>. This result was further refined by Chan et al. by demonstrating the formation of multicellular bone tissue at other ectopic sites and by unravelling routes of differentiation from a discrete progenitor subpopulation to cell types that either contribute to bone, cartilage or haematopoiesissupportive stroma within the new bone organ (Ref. 21). Besides BMSC and HSC, a plethora of other cell types is commonly designated as stem cells, although evidence for clonal in vivo organ formation without pre-induction is missing. This circumstance also holds true for ASC that, nevertheless, are often referred to as adiposederived mesenchymal stem cells, despite the fact that the capacity of a single ASC to build up a functional mesenchymal tissue has not been shown to date. Thus, the idea of universal mesenchymal stem cells in a perivascular niche (Ref. 22) with an intrinsic capacity to build up and maintain multiple mesenchymal tissues (Ref. 8) by a common mesengenic in vivo process is still an unconfirmed hypothesis. Conclusively, BMSC are the only perivascular cells with proven skeletal stem cell characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lack of evidence for stem cell characteristics of ASC</head><p>Current data do not exclude that ASC may possess stem cell characteristics, according to the stringent criteria outlined above, and results are encouraging that future experiments may support adipose tissue-specific stem cell properties. In vitro characterisation of isolated ASC demonstrated extensive proliferative potential (Ref. 5). The application of standard in vitro differentiation protocols to ASC reflected possession of osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation capacity (Ref. 5), although the physiological relevance of these assays has been questioned (Ref. 18). Notably, clonal analyses revealed that &gt;2% of cells within expanded ASC cultures exhibit tri-lineage potential in vitro, indicating that typical isolation protocols lead only to a small fraction of ASC with in vitro multilineage potential after artificial treatment (Ref. 10).</p><p>Like the most mesenchymal cells (Ref. 23), ASC express a cell surface marker profile that is comparable to BMSC (Refs 9, 24), fulfilling all requirements that have been suggested as the minimal criteria for defining multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells <ref type="bibr">(Ref. 25)</ref>. Although most mesenchymal cells also meet these standards (Refs 23, 26), a functional equivalence of ASC and BMSC was construed from this classification and subsequent studies focussed on the question of whether ASC exhibit analogous cartilage and bone regeneration capacities. For this purpose, ASC were directly tested for their application to osteochondral in vivo repair approaches; however, the question whether ASC are skeletal stem cells functionally equivalent to BMSC attracted little interest.</p><p>From a retrospective point of view, it seems inconsistent that ASC were first assessed for their cartilage and bone regeneration potential before their capacity to build up and maintain a physiological adipose tissue environment was investigated. Although in vitro engineered adipose tissue would have a promising potential for surgical soft tissue reconstruction (Ref. 27), strategies using ASC for that purpose are instead clearly outnumbered by approaches that use (pre-)adipocytes <ref type="bibr">(Refs 28,</ref><ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">30,</ref><ref type="bibr">31)</ref>  and subjected to an adipogenic pre-induction protocol prior to subcutaneous implantation. As expected after pre-induction, in vivo adipose tissue formation was reported in these studies. Evidence that transplanted clonal ASC can generate adipose tissue in vivo without such a pre-induction is still missing, but such a demonstration would not only be encouraging for their use in adipose tissue engineering but would also further clarify if ASC may indeed represent tissue-specific stem cells distinct from BMSC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vitro characteristics of expanded ASC and BMSC Similar morphological features but different growth behaviour</head><p>A thorough review of the literature on in vitro performance of culture-expanded ASC and BMSC reveals strong similarities between stromal cells of both sources, factually overweighing the differences. For instance, no morphological differences were reported to date, and the same spindle-shaped phenotype was frequently described <ref type="bibr">(Refs 39,</ref><ref type="bibr">40,</ref><ref type="bibr">41</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reduced performance of ASC in osteochondral in vitro differentiation assays</head><p>In line with indications of an intrinsic osteogenic potential of BMSC, exposure to common osteogenic differentiation media induced more mineralisation (Refs 40, 50, 68, 69), higher alkaline phosphatase activity (Refs 40, 44, 68) and stronger gene expression of osteogenic markers, such as runx2, osteocalcin, osterix, alkaline phosphatase and collagen-1 (Refs 40, 44, 52), compared to ASC. In turn, and corresponding to their physiological origin, ASC seem to exhibit a higher affinity to adipogenic differentiation, since inclusion of lipid droplets (Refs 44, 50, 53) and expression of the adipogenic marker gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) (Refs 44, 53) were more intense than in BMSC upon induction. However, similar adipogenic in vitro differentiation capacities of adipose and bone marrow-derived cells were also reported (Refs 52, 69, 70), but no study described a higher adipogenic potential for BMSC. In line with better in vitro osteogenesis, BMSC also showed better performance in common chondrogenesis assays. In vitro differentiation of BMSC in 3D-pellet culture under treatment with TGF-β resulted in more intense collagen-II staining (Refs 39, 46, 62, 68, 69, 70), proteoglycan deposition (Refs 39, 46, 53, 62, 68, 70) and gene expression of Sox-9 (Ref. 53), compared to ASC. Interestingly, the inferior chondrogenic capacity of ASC can be augmented to BMSC levels when BMP-6 is added to the differentiation medium (Refs 62, 71), an observation with obvious relevance for future in vivo applications of ASC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of trophic activity</head><p>One main path to tissue reconstruction by cellbased therapeutic strategies involves stem cell activity to establish and build new tissue by proliferating and differentiating cells, which are progeny of the implanted cells. A second way to regeneration is the stimulation of endogenous healing capacity by trophic activity of implanted cells, which attract host progenitor cells and organise repair by local and invading cells. Implanted cells may even disappear after this task has been successfully fulfilled. In this second scenario, even transient stem cell activity or differentiation capacity within target tissues may be dispensable as long as trophic activity is high.</p><p>Similar All in all, beyond their reduced performance in osteochondral in vitro differentiation assays, ASC showed no intrinsic osteochondral in vivo differentiation potential and, thus, seem to possess no skeletal stem cell properties as seen with BMSC, providing a strong argument for fundamental functional differences regarding their use for in vivo osteochondral repair. Since nonclonal cells are widely used for tissue regeneration, the benefit of enhanced availability of ASC, therefore, appears currently to be balanced by an enhanced need for inductive conditions via timely and intensive in vitro culture efforts, if their physical contribution to the new skeletal tissue is desired.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing evidence for physical ASC contribution to the repair of damaged cartilage</head><p>The most direct and least invasive approach to use ASC for the treatment of cartilage defects is by intraarticular injection of cells. Studies that started with an induction of osteoarthritis (OA) by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) or collagenase treatment, followed by intra-articular injection of autologous ASC, have been conducted in mouse (Ref. 114) and rabbit (Refs 115, 116) ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>). Different histological evaluations and OA scoring scales were used to measure OA progression, but in all cases, positive effects of ASC compared to the injection of cellfree solvent were reported. Labelled ASC were detectable in the synovial membrane and medial meniscus 20 days after injection (Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">115)</ref> and at the synovial lining and cruciate ligaments up to 5 days after injection (Ref. 114). Human ASC injected into unimpaired mouse knee joints showed long-term persistence in joint tissue in 60% of all mice up to 186 days after injection, but a substantial fraction of ASC seemed to have migrated to the bone marrow, adipose tissue and muscle. Thus, while a certain degree of persistence of injected cells can therefore be assumed, evidence for in vivo differentiation of donor ASC or long-term integration into articular cartilage tissue is missing, and contributions by trophic activity cannot be judged.</p><p>Besides artificial OA induction, the capacity of ASC to repair surgical cartilage incisions has been investigated <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 3)</ref>. In a scheme similar </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Site-dependant bone repair capacity of ASC</head><p>The majority of ASC-based tissue engineering approaches are directed at orthotopic in vivo formation of bone <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 4)</ref>    Controversial data exist regarding the performance of expanded but otherwise untreated ASC in the context of long bone repair, although only a limited number of studies is available <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table  4)</ref>. When nontransgenic or mock-transduced ASC were loaded on carrier matrices and transplanted into long-bone defects, no bone formation was observed ( <ref type="bibr">Refs 129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">132)</ref>. In a sheep longbone model, ASC were unable to induce defect bridging, while BMSC facilitated defect regeneration in the same setting (Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">143)</ref>. A closer look at the ASC control groups of the above studies further confirms the impression that pre-differentiation or genetic manipulation of ASC is a prerequisite for stimulation of bone formation. This applies even for orthotopic sites in long bones, where the microenvironment is rich in osteoinductive proteins which are released from the defect endings. To our knowledge, the only exception when nontransduced ASC led to substantial bone formation in the context of long-bone repair is a study by Han and Li, in which ASC were used as a control to Runx2-overexpressing cells. Possibly, the surgical connection of the implant to the vascular network was the key to the positive results of this study <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Ref. 130)</ref>.</p><p>Dissimilar to long-bone repair, healing of critical size defects in the cranium appears to be less challenging with untreated ASC, since bone formation without any in vitro predifferentiation was reported in at least four studies <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Refs 144, 145, 146, 147)</ref>. Furthermore, untreated ASC that were transplanted as controls for newly established repair strategies also generated considerable amounts of bone <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Refs 125, 128, 142)</ref>, although complete absence of defect repair by ASC control groups has also been described <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Refs 123, 126)</ref>. Thus, orthotopic bone formation by uninduced ASC appears to be site-dependent and favoured by characteristics of the cranial microenvironment that are not present in long bones. Origin from the ectodermal germ layer, development via the intramembranous pathway and enhanced blood supply differentiates bone in the cranium from long bones. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that one major advantage in the cranium may be the denser vascular network of skull bones, which is especially interesting in the context that, beyond an absent osteochondral commitment, a lower angiogenic signature was noted for ASC <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Refs 42, 59, 66, 148</ref>) and orthotopic bone formation by ACS can be triggered by co-transplantation of endothelial cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Ref. 127)</ref>.</p><p>If the trophic activity of ASC is the most crucial for stimulation of bone repair, a lower requirement for attraction and stimulation of endothelial progenitors could explain the better performance of ASC in the cranium. In line with this, a persistence of donor ASC could not be detected for more than 2 to 4 weeks after transplantation, even in settings where complete cranial defect repair was observed (Refs 131, 142). In sharp contrast, a single study by Cowan et al. reported that transplantation of uninduced ASC led to stable engraftment of the cells in a cranial defect and over 95% of nuclei in the newly formed bone were donor-derived after 12 weeks (Ref. 144). As it is not apparent which specific experimental parameters have enabled this exceptional engraftment, analogous success is waiting for repetition. Overall, particular success of ASC in cranial but not long-bone defects suggests that, in view of their low osteochondral and angiogenic signature, ASC affect bone regeneration most probably via their trophic activity than by in situ differentiation to osteoblasts with long-term persistence. Additional precise studies must unravel the contribution of host and donor cells to tissue repair as well as the influence of scaffolds, precultivation, species and defect site in order to reach consensus on the main mechanisms driving ASC-dependent promotion of osteoarticular repair despite lower osteogenic and angiogenic signatures and an apparent lack of skeletal stem cell properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>More than 50 in vivo studies have been performed to date in order to verify the potential of ASC to be used for osteoarticular regeneration.

Regarding the greater accessibility of ASC compared to BMSC, these data are entirely encouraging for the future use of ACS in skeletal regenerative medicine. However, it is now clear that ASC do not exhibit the same degree of osteoarticular predetermination as BMSC and more manipulation is required to drive ASC into the chondrogenic or osteogenic lineage <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The observations that the spontaneous formation of an ectopic bone organ by BMSC cannot be reproduced with ASC and that orthotopic bone formation is only stimulated at favoured sites confirm this issue and thereby exclude a skeletal stem cell identity for ASC. Altogether, a review of the literature suggests that mainly trophic functions determine the therapeutic outcome after ASC application. Future research is needed on a direct comparison of BMSC and ASC in osteoarticular therapy to decide where and how successful BMSC protocols have to be modified to achieve promising results with ASC.</p></div>

Nevertheless, hierarchical clustering of protein and gene expression data allowed for a separation of ASC and BMSC specimen, possibly due to the observation that Wnt-signalling-associated genes are more abundant in BMSC (Ref.52). Increased expression levels of genes that are associated with osteogenesis were detected in BMSC (Refs 62, 64), arguing for a higher degree of osteochondral commitment (Ref. 59). A similar finding was made by mRNA representational difference analysis, where higher ITM2A expression in ASC could be attributed to a lower chondrogenic potential (Ref. 65). An enrichment of genes that are involved in angiogenic signalling pathways was reported for BMSC (Ref. 66) and confirmed by higher expression of angiogenic markers, such as angiopoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in comparison to ASC (Ref. 59). On the other hand, ASC were shown to exhibit a more adipogenic gene expression pattern (Ref. 64), illustrated by higher expression levels of adiponectin and visfatin (Ref. 59). In line with the higher proliferation rate of ASC, genes involved in mitosis and DNA replication are also upregulated compared to BMSC (Ref. 67).</figDesc><table><row><cell>By means of a quality control check that is</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>commonly performed at the beginning of</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>studies, ASC were frequently analysed for</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>CD34-negativity, since the absence of this</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>marker is a prerequisite to meet the minimal</cell><cell>).

Extracellular matrix components and secreted enzymes comprised the largest fraction of the secretome, according to mass spectrometry (Refs 83, 84, 85), but these molecules are unlikely to be heavily involved in the observed paracrine signalling. These effects are instead mediated by secreted cytokines that typically appear in nano-or picomolar concentrations. Corresponding ELISA and multiplex approaches primarily identified VEGF (Refs 86, 87, 88), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Refs 82, 89) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (Refs 77, 90) as factors that are responsible for the described intercellular communication. According to this repertoire, both ASC and BMSC can be expected to display trophic functions (Refs 74, 91), delineating their potential to stimulate bone and cartilage regeneration solely by trophic mechanisms.In vivo comparison of ASC and BMSCThe extent of the described in vitro differences between ASC and BMSC gives the impression that cells of both sources may fundamentally differ from each other. This point of view must be carefully considered, since in vitro variances may stem from dissimilar donor tissue processing, cell isolation protocols, cell yield and culture methods. In the context of osteochondral Ref. 103) in ASC allowed the omission of the pre-differentiation step.Whether ASC possess the same intrinsic ability to form ectopic bone without any of these pretreatments in standard assays, and to what extent they build up new bone themselves, largely remained elusive until the issue was recently addressed by Brocher et al. In this first standardised comparison of BMSC and ASC on multiple donors, ASC generated no ectopic bone on osteoconductive scaffolds, while samples from all BMSC donors formed ossicles under identical conditions(Ref. 59). The additional value of this ASC study was the reliable identification of donor as well as host cells within the ectopic setting via a recently established in situ hybridisation technique, specifically marking highly repetitive DNA sequences of human as well as mouse origin(Ref. 104). This demonstrated that ectopic bone was formed by ASC when they were subjected to chondrogenic pre-differentiation before transplantation. Although, in noninduced The online version of this article is published within an Open Access environment subject to the conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution licence http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by/3.0/ samples, ASC survived at the ectopic site for more than 8 weeks and they did not form bone, as seen in previous studies (Refs 45, 99, 100, 102, 105)(Table 1). Only Zannettino et al. have provided convincing data of ectopic bone formation after ASC implantation on HA/TCP in NOD/SCID mice, when CD146-pre-sorted cells were transplanted; however, the origin of bone from donor or host remained unclear (Ref. 12).</figDesc><table><row><cell>http://www.expertreviews.org/</cell><cell>regeneration, exchangeability of ASC and BMSC is far more the proof of in vivo important, and aspects of in vivo stem cell activity like trophic activity should be considered, as long as precise healing mechanisms are unclear for the diverse application settings. Untreated ASC do not form ectopic bone Ectopic bone formation is a standard activity of human BMSC on calcium phosphate ceramics such as β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and hydroxyapatite (HA)/TCP in immunodeficient mice (Refs 20, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97) with no osteogenic pre-induction protocols required, in line with skeletal stem cell activity of BMSC. Ectopic transplantation of ASC reliably led to de novo generation of bone when cells were subjected to osteogenic pre-induction before implantation (Refs 45, 98, 99, 100, 101).

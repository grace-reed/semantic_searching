			<abstract>
				<p>Oxybenzone (OBZ), an active ingredient in most sunscreens, was recently shown to be toxic to humans, corals and other animals. This study is the first to demonstrate that OBZ can significantly inhibit photosynthesis and respiration in the leaves of a higher plant, cucumber. An OBZ suspension content as low as 0.228 mg/L obviously inhibited the photosynthesis and respiration of cucumber. OBZ instantly inhibits the electron transport of chloroplasts and mitochondria in cucumber leaves. Probit analysis demonstrated that the effective content for 20% inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport was 11.7 mg/L (95% confidence level). The inhibition of photosynthesis and respiration restricts carbohydrate synthesis and ATP regeneration, respectively, limiting the energy available for metabolic processes including the synthesis of vital organic macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids in plant cells. The inhibition of photosynthesis also enhanced the excess excitation energy in chloroplasts, resulting in overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the inhibition of respiration aggravated this process. ROS accumulation adversely affects the structure and function of proteins, DNA and membrane lipids in plant cells, interfering with normal metabolism and even leading to plant death. Therefore, reducing the use of OBZ is important for protecting global ecological security.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Oxybenzone (benzophenone-3, OBZ) is a common ultraviolet absorbent widely used in sunscreens. At present, most commercial chemical sunscreens use OBZ as the main ultraviolet absorbent <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Hayden et al., 1997)</ref>. Recently, with the boom of coastal tourism, approximately 14000 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT tons of sunscreen has entered the world's coral system each year. OBZ has been identified in many water sources and is extremely difficult to be removed using conventional techniques <ref type="bibr">(Samantha et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Downs et al. (2015)</ref> of the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory in Virginia reported that OBZ can destroy coral DNA and lead to the death of coral symbiotic algae, causing widespread bleaching of corals and severely harming marine ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Downs et al., 2015)</ref>. As a result, Hawaii Governor David Ige signed the first bill to ban the use of sunscreens containing chemicals that are harmful to coral; "the bill, which was passed by state lawmakers in May, 2018, will go into effect on January 1, 2021" (July 3, 2018, Cable News Network). However, a large number of sunscreen manufacturers have argued that the decision lacks experimental support from third-party peers and that there are other possibilities explaining the damages to coral. In addition, the American Association for Dermatological Research reported that banning sunscreen will lead to skin cancer and melanoma. Karen Glanz of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center also claimed that environmentally friendly sunscreens cost eight times as much as regular sunscreens. Because of the difficulty in deciding whether to ban the use of OBZ in sunscreen, the Hawaiian Medical Association wants experts to further study the effects of the OBZ used in sunscreen on corals and other plants.</p><p>Most previous studies on OBZ focused on human skin and animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Kasichayanula et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Lenique et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Aguirre et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Emonet et al., 2001)</ref>. OBZ released into the environment can enter aquatic systems in a variety of ways, damaging corals, algae and even higher plants <ref type="bibr">(Dinardo et al., 2017)</ref>. However, until now, studies on the effects of OBZ on higher plants have been very limited. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen et al. (2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al.

The organic matter produced by photosynthesis is the ultimate source of energy for almost all organisms, and photosynthesis also plays an important role in maintaining the balance between CO 2 and O 2 in the biosphere. Respiration is the central hub of energy and substance metabolism and provides ATP and carbon skeletons for all organisms. The inhibition of either of these pathways will damage the growth and metabolism of plants and even lead to their death. In recent decades, OBZ has entered marine ecosystems and groundwater through human activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Zwiener et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Balmer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Goksøyr et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Sánchez et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Downs et al. (2015)</ref> reported that the OBZ content reached 1.395 mg/L in some waters near the Virgin Islands. If OBZ inhibits the metabolism and growth of higher plants, then it will greatly damage agricultural production, terrestrial vegetation and whole ecosystems. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the effects of OBZ on higher plants and to explore the effective content of OBZ that inhibits plants.</p><p>To answer these questions related to understanding the significance of avoiding continuous pollution of the environment by OBZ and maintaining ecosystem security, we studied the effects of OBZ on the photosynthetic and respiratory rates in the leaves of a higher plant, namely, Cucumis sativus L. (a widely planted vegetable), and investigated the instantaneous inhibition of electron transport in the chloroplasts and mitochondria of cucumber by OBZ as well as the effective contents of it. Although the higher OBZ contents used in this study do not exist under natural conditions, the evidence provided by this study will help people realize the harmful effect of OBZ on higher plants. The results of this study provide scientific evidence that supports limiting the use of OBZ.</p></div>

Cucumber seedlings were cultivated in a greenhouse in pots (10 cm diameter, 15 cm height) containing seedling substrate; sufficient nutrients and water were supplied throughout the growing period. The environmental conditions in the greenhouse during the experimental period were as follows: photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), 0-1000 μmol/m 2 /s; relative humidity, 45-84%; and photoperiod, 15 h/9 h (light/dark) with temperature ranges of 27-35°C and 19-27°C, respectively.</p></div>

The OBZ suspensions used for the different treatments in this experiment were 0 mg/L (control), 0.228 mg/L , 1.14 mg/L, 3.42 mg/L, 6.84 mg/L, 11.4 mg/L, 22.8 mg/L, 34.2 mg/L and 45.6 mg/L. If dissolved in alcohol, these different OBZ suspensions corresponded to 1 μM, 5 μM, 15 μM, 30 μM, 50 μM, 150 μM, 100 μM, and 200 μM solutions, respectively. The OBZ suspensions were always stirred before being used to treat the plant materials. The OBZ suspensions were kept in the dark to avoid reaction with ultraviolet radiation, and they were used within 1 h.</p></div>

Then, the discs were taken out and floated in the different OBZ content suspensions under light (1000 PPFD) for 6 h. The timespans between treatments were varied so that we could obtain materials treated with different OBZ content suspensions for the same amount of time. After treatment, the discs were taken out to measure the photosynthetic O 2 release rate and respiratory O 2 uptake rate in each OBZ content suspension once an hour using an Oxytherm oxygen electrode system (Hansatech, King's Lynn, UK) according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">González et al.

An O 2 -saturated curve was established with ambient oxygen-saturated buffer to produce a 100% O 2 curve according to the instructions for the Oxytherm oxygen electrode (Hansatech, King's Lynn, UK); Na 2 S 2 O 3 was used to deplete oxygen in the buffer to establish a zero O 2 curve. Each time a new experiment began, the Oxytherm system was reset, and the O 2 -saturated and zero O 2 curves were re-established. The reaction solution consisted of 1.8 mL deionized water and 200 μL 500 mM NaHCO 3 . Five leaf discs (5×0.38 cm ) were added to the reaction, and the respiration rate was calculated according to the downward slope of the O 2 curve measured in the dark.

The large increase in the J step in the ΔVt curve <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref> indicated that the PET from Q Ato downstream in the electron transport chain was remarkably inhibited. The decreases in RC/CS o , ψ o , φ Eo , PI CSO , F v /F m and ET o /RC indicated that the active photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers, the electron transport beyond Q A -, the quantum yield of electron transport, the performance of PSII function and the maximum photochemistry efficiency were all adversely affected by the OBZ, and the harmful effect increased with an increase in OBZ content. <ref type="figure">Fig.3</ref> When different OBZ contents were added to chloroplast or mitochondrial suspensions, the PET in chloroplasts and the respiratory electron transport in mitochondria were inhibited instantly.

The probit analysis demonstrated that the PET EC was 11.7 mg/L (95% confidence level (CL)). The inhibitory effect of OBZ on the PET in chloroplasts increased significantly with increasing OBZ content, and the PET rate was inhibited by approximately 88.5% under the high OBZ content (45.6 mg/L) treatment, which was approximately 5.6 times the inhibition observed under the 0.228 mg/L OBZ treatment. However, there were no significant differences in the degree of OBZ inhibition of respiratory electron transport among the different OBZ content treatments. OBZ was more harmful to PET than to respiratory electron transport. The mechanism of OBZ injury clearly differed between the two types of transport.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Our study first demonstrated that OBZ has harmful effects on higher plants. Specifically, an OBZ content as low as 0.228 mg/L effectively inhibited the electron transport in photosynthesis and respiration; this content was only approximately 16.3% of a content found in the Virgin Islands <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Downs et al. 2015)</ref>. By inhibiting the electron transport in photosynthesis and respiration, OBZ not only restricts the metabolism and growth of cucumber but also enhances the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which inevitably damage the photosynthetic apparatus, cell membranes, proteins, nucleic acids, etc.</p><p>Although OBZ is insoluble in water, suspended particles of OBZ could enter plant cells through leaf margin infiltration and leaf active absorption to inhibit normal metabolism. Photosynthesis and respiration are both driven by electron transport. The inhibition of the electron transport in photosynthesis and respiration was instant. The inhibition of PET will result in the closure of PSII reaction centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Maxwell and Johnson, 2000)</ref>; the considerable decrease in RC/CS o in leaves treated with OBZ supported this conjecture. The substantial increase in the J point ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2B</ref>) and the decrease in ψ o indicated that the electron transport to Q B downstream was greatly inhibited by OBZ. Combining the effect of OBZ on PET, the OJIP curve, and the parameters derived from the OJIP test, it is reasonable to speculate that damaging the photosynthetic apparatus and inhibiting its function are two of the most harmful effects of OBZ on higher plants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al (2018)</ref> reported that OBZ treatment significantly increased the ROS in plants, and in this study, we demonstrated that with an increase in OBZ content, the ROS content increased ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 13 dramatically. Photosynthesis and respiration are the most important sources of ROS production <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Miller et al., 2010)</ref>. The considerable inhibition of PET will lead to more excess excitation energy, and if this excess excitation energy cannot be safely dissipated by energy dissipation mechanisms, then ROS will be produced <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Zhang et al., 2014)</ref>. The inhibition of respiratory electron transport will also inhibit the use of high energy, which will in turn enhance the production of ROS. In addition to damaging cell membranes, proteins and nucleic acids, accumulated ROS can directly damage vital macromolecules in the cell and affect other metabolic processes through signal transduction <ref type="bibr">(Apel and Hirt., 2014)</ref>. The over accumulation of ROS is an important source of photosynthetic pigment damage, and if the damage becomes severe, then light bleaching of the plant will occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Miller et al., 2010)</ref>. The bleaching of plants normally occurs under strong light, and any inhibition of the light reaction or dark reaction of photosynthesis by stress factors will enhance the bleaching. Because coral symbiotic algae also undergo photosynthesis and respiration, it is reasonable to assume that the inhibition of photosynthesis and respiration by OBZ will facilitate photobleaching of coral symbiotic algae. Therefore, we suggest that the harmful effect of OBZ on photosynthesis and respiration is one of the most important drivers of coral bleaching. The effective OBZ content causing the bleaching of coral should be clarified through additional studies.</p><p>When PET is inhibited, the light energy captured by chloroplasts cannot be converted into chemical energy to provide assimilatory power for CO fixation and reduction in the Calvin cycle, which further inhibits the whole photosynthetic process and restricts sugar synthesis and transport, ultimately inhibiting the development and establishment of new organs and decreasing the substrate for respiratory metabolism. The decrease in the respiratory substrate further restricts respiration. Because of the decrease in respiratory substrates and the inhibition of respiratory electron transport by ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 14 OBZ, the production of ATP is inhibited, limiting the energy supply for various cellular metabolisms. This limitation of energy supply is one of the reasons that OBZ inhibits plant growth and ultimately leads to plant death.</p><p>In conclusion, OBZ treatment not only directly inhibited photosynthesis and respiration but also damaged plants by increasing the ROS content in their cells. Therefore, we speculate that all organisms that undergo respiration and/or photosynthesis, including coral symbiotic algae, will be inhibited by OBZ. Consequently, reducing the use of OBZ is an important way to protect the earth's ecological security. However, the mechanism by which OBZ inhibits photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport and the sites of inhibition need to be clarified through further researches.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Graphical abstract</head><p>OBZ can enter cells to significantly inhibit photosynthesis and respiration in the leaves of a higher plant, cucumber. OBZ can instantly inhibit the electron transports of chloroplasts and mitochondria. The inhibition of photosynthesis and respiration would restrict the synthesis of carbohydrates and the regeneration of ATP, limiting the energy available for metabolic processes. The inhibition of photosynthesis increased the excess excitation energy in the plant cells, resulting in over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the inhibition of respiration aggravated this process. The overaccumulation of ROS adversely affects the structure and function of proteins, DNA and membrane lipids in plant cells, interfering with normal metabolism and even leading to the death of plant.</p></div>

An OBZ content as low as 0.228 mg/L had an obvious harmful effect, and the PET EC 20 was 11.7 mg/L. OBZ can instantly inhibit the electron transport of chloroplasts and mitochondria. The inhibition of photosynthesis and respiration restricts important processes such as the synthesis of carbohydrates and the regeneration of ATP, limiting the energy available for metabolic processes. The inhibition of photosynthesis and respiration also results in the overproduction of ROS. The accumulation of ROS adversely affects the structure and function of proteins, DNA and membrane lipids as well as leads to photobleaching in plant cells, interfering with normal metabolism and even leading to plant death. Authors' contributions Qingming Li, Huiyuan Gao and Xin Zhong designed the research; Yuting Li and Xin Zhong performed all of the research and wrote the article; and Xingkai Che, Zishan Zhang, Binbin Liu and Yiman Li analyzed the data.

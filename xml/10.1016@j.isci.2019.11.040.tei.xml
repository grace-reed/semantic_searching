<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>Life on earth has evolved under constant environmental changes, in response to these changes, most organisms have developed an endogenous clock that allows them to anticipate daily and seasonal changes and adapt their biology accordingly. Light cycles synchronize biological rhythms and are controlled by an endogenous clock which is entrained by environmental cues. Light is known to play a key role in the biology of symbiotic corals as they exhibit many biological processes entrained by daily light patterns.</p><p>In this study, we aimed at determining the effect of constant dim light on coral's perception of diel and monthly cycles. Our results show that under constant dim light corals display a loss of rhythmic processes and constant stimuli by light, which initiates signal transduction that results in an abnormal cell cycle, cell proliferation, and protein synthesis. The results emphasize how constant dim light can mask the biological clock of Acropora digitifera.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>Most organisms, from cyanobacteria to mammals, exhibit biological rhythms by synchronizing their behavioral and physiological activities with cyclic changes in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aschoff, 1960)</ref>. Among these rhythms of varying lengths, twenty-four-hour periodicity is widely observed in most organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Raible et al., 2017)</ref>. In the absence of environmental cues, the periodicity drifts away from the natural phase and is referred to as "free-running". For this reason, synchronization by environmental time cues is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Harmer et al., 2001)</ref>. Studies attempting to understand the mechanisms of endogenous clocks have focused mainly on circadian clocks showing it is based on positive and negative molecules interacting in feedback loops <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Raible et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Roenneberg and Merrow, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Zantke et al., 2013)</ref>. Although, many organisms exhibit biological rhythms with longer (infradian) periodicity. One of these longer rhythms is the circalunar clock that oscillates with a period of approximately one month (~29.5 days) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aschoff, 1981)</ref>. External environmental cues (light, temperature) are used to entrain the oscillators of other biological clocks, with longer and shorter periodicities, in adaptation to the local conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dupré and Loudon, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Franke, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kaiser et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Naylor, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schnytzer et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The lunar cycle refers to the 29.5 days (lunar month) required for the moon to orbit around the Earth, and the 24.8 hours (lunar day) required for the moon to reach the same spot on the Earth. Several recurring events are linked to the position of the moon relative to the Earth and the sun. Among these events, there are a few causing environmental changes, such as the tidal forces causing changes in water level and current, moonlight intensity and time of moonrise <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gibson, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schnytzer et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Solar light is a well-known synchronizer of the circadian clock, yet, moonlight which is incident sunlight reflected from the lunar surface is known to affect periodic activities occurring in a variety of animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bentley et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kaniewska et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kronfeld-Schor et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rosenberg et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schnytzer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Takemura et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>One of the earliest phenomena to be tied to the lunar cycle is the reproduction of marine invertebrates. In many species, including reef corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Richmond and Hunter, 1990)</ref>, fishes <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Takemura et al., 2004)</ref>, echinoderms <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Mercier and Hamel, 2014)</ref>, mollusks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Counihan et al., 2001</ref>) and crustaceans <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Skov et al., 2005)</ref>, the annual breeding events are synchronized with the lunar phase. This synchronization is commonly thought to be mediated by external cues that may act directly or indirectly to reset or maintain the biological clocks. Successful fertilization of marine invertebrates relies on the tight synchronization between the release of male and female germ products. The moon cycle provides these organisms with a predictable timeframe that can be used for synchronization even across wide-spread populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Babcock et al., 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Coral reproductive timing is characterized by strong lunar rhythmicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Boch et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hanafy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Jokiel et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kaniewska et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Richmond and Hunter, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Shlesinger and Loya, 1985)</ref>. A common example is the mass spawning in the Great Barrier Reef, where changes in moonlight intensity can act as a final cue triggering the spawning of many different species of scleractinian corals as well as hundreds of other invertebrates, over a couple of nights <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Harrison et al., 1984)</ref>.</p><p>Light plays a key role in the growth, reproduction, and physiology of scleractinian corals that host phototrophic symbionts and reside in shallow water <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cohen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kaniewska et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Levy et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rosenberg et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Wijgerde et al., 2014)</ref>. The action spectra of coral photoreception reveal a maximum sensitivity in the blue region, at 480nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gorbunov and Falkowski, 2002)</ref>, which is also known to entrain the circadian clocks of insects and mammals via cryptochromes (CRYs), which are DNA photolyase-like photoreceptor proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Falciatore and Bowler, 2005)</ref>.

A survey of Acropora digitifera photoreceptors revealed seven opsin and three cryptochrome genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Shoguchi et al., 2013)</ref>. A previous study on the coral Acropora millepora showed that the known light receptor and core clock gene cryptochromes displayed rhythmic expression in response to light: dark treatment and influenced by lunar light <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Levy et al., 2007)</ref>. Photoreceptors are also responsible for the photoentrainment of circadian rhythms and their threshold of photoreception sensitivity is low enough for corals to sense natural moonlight <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gorbunov and Falkowski, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Levy et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reitzel et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Photoentrainment of rhythmic processes in corals is highly important as it regulates metabolism, photosynthesis, synchronized spawning, and calcification <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Sorek et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we explore the complexities of gene expression according to the lunar phase changes in a reef-building coral, Acropora digitifera ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>), using RNA-seq analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Photosynthetic yield</head><p>By measuring photosynthetic yield at the beginning and end of the experiment for each treatment (AMB and LL), we confirmed that coral colonies had no significant decrease in maximal quantum yield, median values of maximal quantum yield (Fv/Fm) were 0.71 for all colonies at the start of the experiment and 0.70 and 0.71 for LL and AMB colonies, respectively at the end of the experiment <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. Thus, we can conclude that coral bleaching and/or damage did not have an impact on the results reported here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential expression and pathway analysis</head><p>In order to discover biologically important changes in gene expression between conditions, we performed differential expression analysis of our RNA-Seq data. Each of the 48 samples sent for RNA sequencing yielded an average of 16062693 paired-end sequences <ref type="table">(Table S.1</ref> Sequencing metrics). Samples were aligned to the Acropora digitifera transcriptome with an average of 40% sequences from each sample mapped to the known transcriptome (supplementary file) and found 23,642 gene models. We started with comparing all AMB to LL samples and arraying them by sampling time and moon phase to understand how the time of day and the moon phase causes differences in expression level between the experimental groups ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2A&amp;B</ref>). Our results showed a substantial difference in the expression levels of DE genes between the experimental groups, LL samples had 4,472 genes up-regulated (19% of total genes counts) and 4,691 genes down-regulated (20% of total genes counts) when compared to the AMB samples. In the AMB samples, we could recognize gene patterns responding to both moon phase and time of day with levels changing accordingly with a specific pattern for the day time and night time samples ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2A</ref>). As opposed to the AMB samples, the LL samples showed different expression levels at each sampling point <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 2B</ref>). The LL full moon samples (first sampling day) showed strong variation in expression levels between day and night that did not repeat in the following sampling points. Interestingly, after almost three weeks of sampling and four weeks under LL conditions, the new moon samples showed a strong variation between day and night time samples. Although we observed the strong peak in expression during the new moon day time samples, the patterns had different expression than the AMB new moon day time samples. We then continued with the MetaCycle analysis to evaluate periodicity in the expressed transcripts in both conditions. AMB samples showed 58 synexpression clusters that were rhythmic across all sampling time points ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3A</ref>) and had specific gene networks for every time point as well as unique genes that corresponded with only one sampling point <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3B</ref>). The LL samples did not show any rhythmic gene clusters across the different sampling points and had more gene overlaps and less unique genes for specific time points than the AMB samples ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3C</ref>).</p><p>We were able to identify the different clusters that are DE in each moon phase and arrange them according to specific pathways <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4)</ref> Response and PPARα/RXRα Activation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4)</ref>. We could also find pathways that are DE between the moon phases only in the LL samples and not in the AMB samples such as CD40 and GP6 signaling pathways. Some of the pathways were found to be DE under AMB conditions and not under LL conditions include Rac, Dopamine and IL-8 signaling. The AMB pathway cluster represents the natural variance coral express throughout the lunar phase of a single month.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cyclic gene expression</head><p>Next, the expression levels of known clock-related genes of A. digitifera in the different lunar phases under the two light conditions were established. In the AMB samples three of the genes, cry1, npas2, and pdp showed the synexpression pattern <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 5A, B, D)</ref>, high levels during day time sampling and lower levels during night time with a slight difference between the moon phases. The clock gene showed the opposite expression pattern ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5C</ref>) with high levels during the night and lower during the day. All of the above clock-related genes expressed in the LL samples showed no significant variance between night and day and moon phases.</p><p>Lastly, we tested another group of genes in relation to light exposer, the Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Three annotated FGF genes in the A. digitifera transcriptome were found, FGF1R, FGF3R, and FGF1 that were highly expressed in the LL samples during all moon phases as opposed to the AMB samples where levels were constantly lower <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 6A, B and C)</ref>.</p><p>In addition, no significant variance between day and night was observed.</p><p>By comparing all AMB genes to each other we were interested in genes that react solely to the lunar phase and not to the time of day. We found a group of DE genes (n= 23 genes with annotations) that are involved in initiating many signaling pathways via GPCRs activation and resulting in DNA binding and RNA transcription. Additional pathways that were enriched in response to lunar phase are microtubule binding and extracellular matrix organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Only a few studies up to date have focused on the coral response to lunar cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Jokiel et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kaniewska et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Levy et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rosenberg et al., 2017)</ref> and coral circadian gene expression across the lunar phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brady et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Levy et al., 2007)</ref>  Artificial light may be difficult to distinguish from natural changes in light intensity and duration and could override the endogenous clock <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dominoni, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gaston et al., 2013)</ref>. This study demonstrates the potential impacts that modern lighting can have on coral reefs.</p><p>Our results show that corals under ambient conditions, perceiving natural light: dark and lunar cycles, express diel and monthly variation in gene expression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2A)</ref> as a response to the environmental changes. Our AMB samples present the natural variation in gene expression that occurs in A.digitifera during the month of July and was used as a control reference in the analysis. In the LL samples, there was no continuous cyclic variation in gene expression in response to the time of day or the lunar phase <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. In many organisms, rhythmicity loss as a result of constant conditions is well described for both gene expression and behavior, specifically under constant dim light <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Granados-Fuentes, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Njus et al., 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Steinlechner et al., 2002)</ref>. The absence of entrainment cues causes the loss of these rhythmic patterns.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that in case of returning to natural light and dark conditions the rhythmicity will be restored <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Granados-Fuentes, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Njus et al., 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Steinlechner et al., 2002)</ref>. LL samples collected on the day of the full moon, after a few days of constant dim light, did have a significant difference in gene expression between the day and the night. We postulate that these differences are natural fluctuations in gene expression, which were still under the regulation of an endogenous clock that was able to overcome the masking effect of the continuous dim light. Many studies have shown that the biological clock of an organism can maintain a rhythm in gene expression or behavior after being kept in constant conditions for a few days <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chabot et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Griffin et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Levy et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Oren et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Peres et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Sorek et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sorek and Levy, 2012)</ref>. Therefore, we assume the oscillations in gene expression under LL conditions at the first sampling day are still governed by the clock machinery. Daytime new moon samples under LL conditions expressed down-regulation of gene clusters that are not only surprising in appearance but also in expression pattern when compared to the equivalent AMB samples. Observing the DE genes temporal pattern during the four moon phases under natural conditions shows that corals present diel and monthly variations in gene expression, while after a few days under constant conditions rhythmicity is lost.</p><p>When focusing on enriched pathways constituted by the DE genes we found many pathways that act in contrary mode between the AMB and LL samples <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4A &amp; B)</ref>. ERK/MAPK signaling pathway causes signal transduction from a receptor on the cell's surface to the cell's nucleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Seger and Krebs, 1995)</ref> and was found to be up-regulated in the LL samples ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 4B)</ref> and down-regulated in the AMB samples <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4A</ref>). This signaling pathway initiates cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and development as a result of an external signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Seger and Krebs, 1995)</ref>. The ERK/MAPK signaling pathway together with the Integrin and NGF signaling pathways, which were also upregulated in the LL samples, regulate the cell cycle, cell proliferation and cell growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Howe et al., 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Howe et al., , 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Howe and Mobley, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Niederhauser et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schwartz, 2001)</ref>. We propose that constant dim light can cause a continuous signal for the initiation of these pathways and therefore known rhythmic processes such as cell cycle, are no longer under tight regulation that is probably masked <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Armbrust et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hunt and Sassone-Corsi, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jacquet et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Matsuo et al., 2003</ref>).</p><p>An additional up-regulated pathway that was enriched in the LL samples, while down-regulated in the AMB samples, is the CREB signaling pathway. CREB is a transcription factor, which binds to DNA sequences called cAMP response elements (CRE) and causes an increase or decrease in transcription of these genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bourtchuladze et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Purves, 2004)</ref>. Circadian rhythm entrainment by light and clock gene transcription is partly under CREB phosphorylation regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Riccio et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Tischkau et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Zhang et al., 1996)</ref>. The CREB signaling pathway reacts to light and provides information essential for normal clock function as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Obrietan et al., 1999)</ref>. Therefore, it is not surprising that the CREB signaling pathway was up-regulated under dim light as it reacted to the constant stimulation of light. Other pathways enriched in the LL samples such as CD40 and GP6 signaling pathways are linked to cell regulation process, immune system and phosphorylation <ref type="bibr">(Faris, 1994, p. 40;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jones et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sokol et al., 2012)</ref>. Pathways that were only DE under AMB conditions can all be found to have circadian regulation or modulating rhythmic processes by dynamically regulating the concentration of intracellular second messengers. These pathways include the Rac, Dopamine and IL-8 signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Beaulieu and Gainetdinov, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Duffield et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ghasemi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hermann et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hwang et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Norman et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Yujnovsky et al., 2006)</ref>. Finding these rhythmic processes to be enriched only in the AMB samples gives an additional proof that under LL conditions the rhythmicity is lost and most known genes that have a diel or monthly fluctuation in expression would not be enriched in the LL samples.</p><p>In order to determine the loss of rhythmicity at the mechanism level and not only on gene expression we compared the gene expression of known clock genes of A. digitifera between the two light conditions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig.5</ref>). All four clock-related genes, cry1, npas2, clock, and pdp exhibited diel variation in expression in AMB samples across all moon phases, while under LL conditions there was no significant diel variation in gene expression and levels were constantly lower than in the AMB samples. Loss of expression, "dampening", in related clock genes is a known phenomenon after a few days under constant conditions with no entrainment cue <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chabot et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dominoni, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dupré and Loudon, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Griffin et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Raible et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reitzel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Roenneberg and Merrow, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Sorek et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Sorek et al., , 2013</ref>. The coordination of many biological processes is facilitated by the biological clock, therefore disruptions in cueing or masking the clock machinery have the potential to influence a range of downstream pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ceriani et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kondratov et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Somers et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Takahashi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Zheng et al., 2001)</ref>.</p><p>When looking at an organism under constant light it is important to examine the effect on cells that perceive light, photoreceptors, and not only on rhythmic biological processes. Studies attempting to understand this effect of light on photoreceptors have found that constant light causes photoreceptor degradation and upregulation of Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Campochiaro et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Courtois, 1992, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hisatomi et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hochmann et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Qin et al., 2011)</ref>. FGFs are the largest family of growth factors involved in soft-tissue growth and regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Basilico and Moscatelli, 1992)</ref>. It was found that under constant light, FGFs cause regeneration of photoreceptors that were degraded due to the effect of the light treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Campochiaro et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hisatomi et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hochmann et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Qin et al., 2011)</ref>. In our data, we found that three FGFs were upregulated in the LL samples compared to the AMB samples <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 6A, B, C)</ref>. These results correspond with previous studies showing that FGFs protect photoreceptors from the damaging effect of constant light <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gao and Hollyfield, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">LaVail et al., 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Genes that were found to be responsive to the lunar cycle and not to the diel cycle revealed pathways altered between the lunar phases. Most of these genes use signaling pathways initiated by GPCR's, pathways known to be environmentally responsive, mainly to light. Many genes show changes in expression levels based on the lunar phase, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brady et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fukushiro et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Levy et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Numata and Helm, 2014)</ref> but most of them show changes between day and night time. The observed genes create specific pathways that react solely to the lunar cycle and are most likely responsive to the moonlight since they are connected to the GPCR signaling pathway. These pathways result in DNA binding and RNA transcription and we postulate the moon phase has a role in determining gene expression, which regulates the organization and formation of extracellular matrix-assisted by microtubules.</p><p>To conclude, this study shows that constant dim light conditions could cause loss of rhythmic processes in the coral A. digitifera. The results demonstrate that even low levels of illumination could override the changes in the moon phase and cause loss of circadian and circalunar regulation. The diel light cycle controls many vital processes, the connection between artificial light and clock disorders is well known and difficulties with adjusting the circadian clock in corals could impact the natural processes that allow them to thrive and populate the oceans. Since the lunar phase controls oogenesis in many corals, the masking of moonlight could affect the synchronized spawning phenomenon and cause reproduction failure in heavily lit areas.</p><p>Therefore, the increase of artificial light in coastal areas is a growing threat to coral reefs around the world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of the Study</head><p>From a clock point of view, one of the challenging tasks is to plan the sampling regime according to the turnover of the RNA molecules in order to understand the daily and monthly oscillations of gene expression. Future studies should focus, at a molecular level, on the obstruction of constant light on a proposed circalunar oscillator, by diel sampling across an entire lunar month, to test whether the above processes are controlled by one circadian clock or by two separate circadian and circalunar clocks.</p><p>Data and Software Availability: The sequencing data reported in this study has been deposited to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), under accession PRJNA526391: Characterizing circalunar and diel rhythmicity in the model coral Acropora digitifera, a molecular perspective.

Many of the pathways show variation across the moon phases in both groups but have the opposite expression pattern. For example, ERK/MAPK, Integrin, NGF and CREB signaling in the LL samples are up-regulated or not DE in the different moon phases, while the same signaling pathways are down-regulated or not DE in the AMB samples. The main pathways that were down-regulated in the LL samples and upregulated in the AMB samples include the D-myo-inositol (3,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate Biosynthesis, D-myo-inositol (1,4,5,6)-Tetrakisphosphate Biosynthesis, 3-phosphoinositide Degradation, G Beta Gamma Signaling, Cell Cycle Regulation by BTG Family Proteins, p53 Signaling, Role of p14/p19ARF in Tumor Suppression, NRF2-Mediated Oxidative Stress</figDesc></figure>

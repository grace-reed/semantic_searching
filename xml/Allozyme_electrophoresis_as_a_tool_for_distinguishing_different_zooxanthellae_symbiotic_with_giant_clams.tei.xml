			<abstract>
				<p>The taxonomy of zooxanthellae in marine invertebrate symbioses is not well understood owing mainly to their lack of reliable morphological di¡erences. Nevertheless, previous work using protein and DNA electrophoreses has set the stage for advancing our taxonomic understanding of cnidarian zooxanthellae. Here we present the use of allozymes as genetic markers for distinguishing algal isolates from tridacnid hosts. Zooxanthellae from seven Tridacna and Hippopus species were isolated and maintained in axenic clonal cultures over many generations. Of 16 enzyme systems, a-and b-esterase (EST), esterase-F (EST-F), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were found suitable polymorphic markers of genetic di¡erences among clonal cultures. Of 39 clonal isolates, 97% were found to be genetically distinguishable. This high extent of genetic variation in zooxanthellae within and between clam species was unexpected, and is di¤cult to explain based solely on the general notion of asexual reproduction in symbiotic zooxanthellae. Our results are also consistent with the occurrence of sexual reproduction in clam zooxanthellae. The close genetic similarity of the symbionts of Tridacna gigas, the largest and fastest-growing clam species, and the di¤culty of initiating their clonal cultures in the given nutrient medium, compared with the symbionts of other clam species, are further indicative of possibly distinct algal symbionts in T. gigas. These ¢ndings are discussed in light of current taxonomic understanding of these organisms.</p>

These algal symbionts secrete photosynthetic products which support most energy and some structural demands of their animal host <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Trench et al. 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fisher et al. 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gri¤ths &amp; Streamer 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Klumpp et al. 1992</ref>). Indeed, the success and large size of giant clams in reef waters have been related, to some extent, to the presence of these algal symbionts, owing to the extra nourishment derived by the former from the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Klumpp et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lucas 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Giant clams have long been used in the shell-craft industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Juinio et al. 1989)</ref> and as a source of food in many Indo-Paci¢c countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Juinio et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lucas 1994)</ref>. However, pressure from over¢shing and the destruction of reef environments have led to the localized extinction of some species <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lucas 1994)</ref> and pose a threat to the others. Mariculture and conservation e¡orts have therefore been underway for sometime now to ensure the continued existence and supply of clams in the Indo-Paci¢c region <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lucas 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Whilst the genetics of the clam host has been investigated to some extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Benzie &amp; Williams 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Munro 1993)</ref>, that of its algal symbionts is virtually unexplored. The taxonomy of symbiotic dino£agellates in general is not well understood, due to the paucity of their distinguishing morphological characteristics <ref type="bibr">(Freudenthal 1962</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schoenberg &amp; Trench 1980b)</ref>. Research into zooxanthellae genetics is also di¤cult due to the apparent lack of sexual reproduction in these organisms (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg &amp; Trench 1980a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Trench 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rowan &amp; Powers 1991a)</ref>. In many studies of marine invertebrate symbiosis, zooxanthellae are referred to simply as Symbiodinium sp., since the speci¢c taxonomy is still unknown.</p><p>There have been several taxonomic studies of zooxanthellae, mostly from cnidarian hosts. These studies have relied upon morphological comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Schoenberg &amp; Trench 1980b)</ref>, host interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schoenberg &amp; Trench 1980c)</ref>, and DNA-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rowan &amp; Powers 1991a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">,b, 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rowan &amp; Knowlton 1995)</ref>. The general picture that has emerged from these studies is that many taxa of symbiotic zooxanthellae occur in the marine environment, and that genetically similar symbionts are speci¢c to a host species. However, genetically similar taxa may be common to a number of taxonomically distant hosts <ref type="bibr">(Rowan &amp; Powers 1991a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">McNally et al. 1994)</ref>. Under controlled conditions, some algal symbionts may infect other hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fitt 1985)</ref>, but this does not always occur readily and may result in reduced numbers of infecting symbionts in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schoenberg &amp; Trench 1980c)</ref>.</p><p>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Molea &amp; Munro (1994)</ref> investigated the e¡ects of zooxanthellae taken from various clam sources on the growth of Tridacna gigas juveniles. They found that algae taken from fast-growing T. gigas had a signi¢cant positive e¡ect on the survival and growth rates of juvenile clams. This observation and suggestions made by a number of researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fitt 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Macaranas 1993)</ref> have prompted us to investigate the identity and properties of zooxanthellae isolates from di¡erent tridacnid clams.</p><p>In this study, we have analysed the same allozyme markers investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg and Trench (1980a)</ref>, with emphasis on the use of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Allozyme analysis is particularly well suited to the analysis of genetic diversity under ¢eld conditions, unlike DNA-based methods, which require sensitive, expensive equipment, and a high degree of operator skill. The technique allows large numbers of samples to be processed quickly and cheaply, making it an ideal choice for identifying clonal isolates with only minimal equipment and culture facilities, a situation common to giant clam mariculture facilities in the Indo-Paci¢c region.</p><p>The ability to identify and characterize genetically di¡erent zooxanthellal isolates from giant clams, in addition to its obvious scienti¢c interest, is a necessary ¢rst step in evaluating zooxanthellae for the potential improvement of the mariculture of these bivalves. Enhanced mariculture techniques, in turn, should lead to decreased ¢shing pressure on natural populations, with increased production of juvenile clams for commercial purposes and conservation programmes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>(a) Isolation and culture of zooxanthellae T. gigas, T. derasa, T. squamosa, T. maxima, T. crocea, Hippopus hippopus and H. porcellanus were obtained from cultured and captive wild stocks being held in the ocean nurseries of the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute's (UPMSI) Bolinao Marine laboratory in <ref type="bibr">Pangasinan, Philippines (16825' N, 119855' E)</ref>. The wild clams originally came from north-eastern, north-western, and western Philippines. As larvae, the cultured clams were initially infected with zooxanthellae extracted from parent clams that originally came from central Philippines and the Solomon Islands. Mantle clippings (51cm ) from each clam were homogenized in 0.45 mm Millipore-¢ltered sea water (MFSW) using a blender, and ¢ltered on a double layer of cheese cloth to remove animal mucus and debris <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Belda et al. 1993)</ref>. Zooxanthellae were collected and washed several times in MFSW by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min to produce freshly isolated zooxanthellae (FIZ). These were then analysed by electrophoresis or brought into crude culture in f/2 media <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guillard &amp; Ryther 1962)</ref> at a constant temperature of 28 8C, irradiance level of 150 mE m 72 s 71 , and photoperiod of 12 h:12 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Belda &amp; Yellowlees 1995)</ref>. After a few days of incubation, freshly pulled Pasteur pipettes and an inverted microscope were used to isolate single motile cells from serial dilutions of a drop of zooxanthellae suspension placed in a Petri dish. Single cells were then incubated for at least a month in individual test tubes containing f/2 media, under the above conditions of growth. Viable clones were treated with a triple-antibiotic solution of penicillin G (125 g l ), streptomycin (62.5 g l ), and chloramphenicol (12.5 g l ) for 24 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Belda 1994)</ref>. Sterility tests in nutrient broth were carried out periodically to check for bacterial contamination. Uncontaminated cultures were subcultured into 50-ml cultures and routinely transferred every two weeks. Subsequently, the clonal cultures were further puri¢ed by re-isolating a single algal cell from each parent culture, and growing into a 50-ml culture or a one-litre culture in Fernbach £asks, under the conditions mentioned above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b) Harvest of zooxanthellae and extraction of algal proteins</head><p>After 2^3 weeks of culture (log phase), zooxanthellae were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min. Zooxanthellae pellets were washed once in MFSW, twice in distilled water, and then recovered by further centrifugation after each wash. Clean pellets were resuspended in two volumes of an extraction bu¡er modi¢ed from <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg and Trench (1980a)</ref>, i.e. 100 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 15 mM 2-b-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM b-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, 50% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.01% (w/v) bromophenol blue, at pH 7.1, and then sonicated for 1 min on ice. Extracts were stored at 720 8C until ready for use. Extracts were later centrifuged at 15 000 g for 2 min, and the supernatant loaded onto electrophoresis gels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(c) Gel electrophoresis</head><p>Electrophoresis was used to resolve the allozymes present in the protein extracts from harvested algae. Both starch gel electrophoresis (SGE) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) were initially used for this purpose.</p><p>For SGE analysis, 12% (w/v) starch gels (15 cm wide Â 20 cm long) were run at 35 mA and 4 8C for 4 h. The bu¡ers used were those outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg &amp; Trench (1980a)</ref>. PAGE analysis of samples was carried out using the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Laemmli (1970)</ref>, without the addition of SDS to gels or bu¡ers. The gel dimensions were 5 Â10 cm, with a resolving gel concentration of 15% acrylamide, 1.4% bis-acrylamide and a stacking-gel concentration of 3.9% acrylamide, 0.34% bis-acrylamide. Gels were run at 15 mA and 4 8C until the bromophenol blue dye-front reached the bottom of the resolving gel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(d) Enzyme staining</head><p>The methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg and Trench (1980a)</ref> were used to detect a-and b-esterase (EST), tetrazolium oxidase (TO), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). EST staining involved the simultaneous detection of both a-and b-speci¢c enzymes. Acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), catalase (CAT), esterase-F (EST-F), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), glycerol-3phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), diaphorase (DIA), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and peroxidase (PER) staining were performed according to the methods described by <ref type="bibr">May (1992)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(e) Analysis of allozyme patterns</head><p>To ensure the accuracy of allozyme patterns, all EST results were run in triplicate, and all others at least in duplicate. Patterns that could not be con¢rmed by duplicate or triplicate analyses were repeated until a consensus was reached. Replicates consisted of batches of algae grown at di¡erent times. Both Fernbach £ask (one-litre) and £ask (50-ml) cultures were analysed for most isolates. Repuri¢ed clones of most isolates were analysed once to con¢rm that the parent cultures were clonal.</p><p>The analytical method described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg &amp; Trench (1980a)</ref> was adopted. This involved scoring each allozyme band as a morphological character, then calculating the Jaccard similarity coe¤cient <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sneath &amp; Sokal 1973)</ref> for each symbiont, and ¢nally presenting the results as a pairwise dendrogram.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(f) Scoring of allozymes and analysis of data</head><p>After staining, the gels were photographed and prints were made for scoring. Comparisons between the allozyme patterns allowed each unique allozyme band to be identi¢ed. The presence (1) or absence (0) of each allozyme band was noted for every isolate. Jaccard similarity coe¤cients (S j ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sneath &amp; Sokal 1973)</ref> were calculated from the data collected. The data were then displayed graphically in the form of dendrograms created using the unweighted average linkage method of clustering analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sneath &amp; Sokal 1973)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>(a) Culture of zooxanthellae On average, 20% (two out of ten replicate clones) of the clonal zooxanthellae cultures initiated from the FIZ of T. derasa, T. squamosa, T. maxima, T. crocea, H. hippopus, and H. porcellanus were viable. Cloning attempts on FIZ from T. gigas were not at all successful. Zooxanthellae isolated from T. gigas had to be ¢rst brought into crude culture for the cloning attempt to be successful, if at all. On the other hand, the success rate of establishing repur-i¢ed clonal cultures from previously cloned zooxanthellae was ca. 50%. It generally took 3^4 weeks to detect visible growth of zooxanthellae clones in test tubes. The 39 clonal cultures that were subsequently analysed consisted of one to ten clones from each of one to two individual hosts of each of the seven clam species.  <ref type="bibr">[SU]</ref> cultured clams from wild parent stocks) were used to determine the usefulness of di¡erent allozyme systems in determining the genetic di¡erence among the algal isolates. SGE analysis of the cultures produced polymorphic allozyme patterns. However, it was di¤cult to determine the patterns for most of the cultures due to poor resolution and staining (results not shown). PAGE analysis of the same samples demonstrated clear polymorphic patterns with good resolution of allo-zymes. For this reason PAGE analysis was used to investigate all allozyme markers.</p><p>After allozyme analysis of these algal cultures, EST, EST-F, MDH, and GPI were found to be polymorphic, with considerable di¡erences detected in the allozyme patterns between isolates. ACP, AKP, G6PDH, and G3PDH were polymorphic but di¤cult to detect. CAT, SOD, TO, and PER were monomorphic and therefore unsuitable for use in distinguishing genetic di¡erences. DIA, GDH, LDH, and ADH could not be detected.</p><p>Due to their polymorphic nature, stability, and ease of detection, EST, EST-F, MDH, and GPI allozymes were used for the analysis of all algal isolates. Extracts could be stored for up to two weeks at 720 8C before some of these allozyme patterns became unstable. MDH and GPI allozymes were particularly sensitive to degradation; whereas, EST and EST-F were, in general, very stable. Of the four allozyme systems, EST was the most informative with respect to the number of unique scoreable bands (22). By comparison EST-F (12), GPI (12), and MDH <ref type="formula">7</ref>were less informative. The allozyme patterns of the 39 clonal isolates obtained for these four enzyme systems are given in ¢gure 1 (a^d).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(c) Analysis of allozyme patterns</head><p>The presence or absence of each allozyme band was recorded for all cultures and the results entered into an array of 53 characters (scorable allozyme bands) by 39 species (data not shown). The pattern for each species was compared with all other species using the coe¤cient S j <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sneath &amp; Sokal 1973)</ref>. The results of the unweighted average linkage method of clustering analysis of the calculations of S j are displayed in ¢gure 2.</p><p>From the S j dendrogram (¢gure 2), 11 out of 12 TG (T. gigas) clones form a cluster. PHMS TC2B, PHMS TC2C, and PHMS TC2D (T. crocea) clones also form a cluster; however, this cluster is by no means as clear as that for the TG clones. There appears to be at least four major clusters distinguishable at the level where TG clones cluster. Similar trends were observed from a graphical display of calculated Jaccard genetic identity coe¤cients, I j <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sneath &amp; Sokal 1973)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(data not shown).</formula><p>The a-and b-EST patterns of FIZ from T. gigas juveniles were also investigated (¢gure 1a). The patterns did not match those of the Tg cultures. Both FIZ and cultured zooxanthellae (CZ) contained allozymes which were absent in the other. Likewise, the MDH and GPI allozyme bands, which were distinctive for di¡erent clonal cultures in the HH CZ, could not be detected in the HH FIZ. Only bands of GPI activity present in all CZ clones could be detected easily in the FIZ (¢gure 1d).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>(a) Asexual versus sexual reproduction in symbiotic zooxanthellae</p><p>Individual zooxanthellae isolated from giant clams were virtually all genetically distinguishable from each other, based on their allozyme patterns. This degree of variation in clonal isolates from the same host species (and individual) has not as yet been reported.</p><p>Such variation may arise from a number of processes, which include accumulated mutations during asexual reproduction, as well as sexual recombination. Some of the variation observed in this study was almost certainly caused by mutation during clonal growth. However, it is di¤cult to imagine that the large variation seen between our clonal isolates, based on comparisons of a small number of alleles, was caused solely by clonal mutation. A large part of this variation may well be caused by sexual recombination.</p><p>Sexual reproduction has been reported in dino£agellates <ref type="bibr">(P¢ester 1987)</ref>, but so far there is little evidence of this in Symbiodinium sp. Suggestions of the absence of sexual reproduction in zooxanthellae have been based largely on observations of cultured algae (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg &amp; Trench 1980a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Trench 1987)</ref>. Whilst it has been assumed that sexual reproduction is lacking in zooxanthellae symbiotic with cnidarians <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Schoenberg &amp; Trench 1980a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Trench 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rowan &amp; Powers 1991a)</ref>, suggestions of sexual reproduction have been made by <ref type="bibr">Freudenthal (1962)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Taylor (1974)</ref>. However, the life cycles reported by these researchers are not in agreement (see also .</p><p>Examination of the coccoid and mastigote stages of Symbiodinium sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blank &amp; Trench 1985;</ref> suggests that both stages are haploid. Hence, meiosis would not occur in the coccoid cells.  suggests that if sexual reproduction does occur in these organisms, infrequent events of sexual recombination may take place in the`free-living' state. If such is the case, then it seems likely that clams are able to acquire their genetically diverse symbionts from the water column. Giant clams initially obtain their complement of algal symbionts during their larval and early juvenile stages of development <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fitt &amp; Trench 1981)</ref>. It is possible then that as clams grow, they are able to obtain new zooxanthellae from their surroundings through ¢lter feeding, or even exchange their symbionts, thereby accounting for their highly diverse algal population.</p><p>That only haploid forms have been seen in hospite does suggest that sexual reproduction, if it occurs in these organisms, occurs in the`free-living' form. However, although the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Trench &amp; Blank (1985)</ref> has been used to imply that both the coccoid and mastigote stages are haploid , later evidence suggests that chromosome' counting may not be as reliable as was ¢rst thought, since condensed DNA regions (CDRs) may not represent whole chromosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Udy &amp; Hinde 1993)</ref>. If the coccoid cells are diploid or haploid, and if sexual reproduction occurs in hospite, this would imply that <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Dendrogram demonstrating the genetic relationships among the clonal isolates of zooxanthellae from giant clams based on Jaccards similarity coe¤cient <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sneath &amp; Sokal 1973</ref> zooxanthellae have a number of cryptic life stages of possibly short duration and infrequent occurrence, which occur in hospite. As these life stages have not been observed to date, they could probably be morphologically similar to the dominant coccoid form and/or infrequent in occurrence.</p><p>It is interesting that the ability of other dino£agellates to reproduce sexually is induced by nutrient limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chesnick &amp; Cox 1987</ref>, while zooxanthellae numbers within hosts are thought to be controlled by nutrient limitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Muscatine &amp; Pool 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Trench 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Belda et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Belda &amp; Yellowlees 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Belda-Baillie et al. 1998)</ref>. It might therefore be possible that nutrient limitation triggers the sexual stage of the zooxanthellae life cycle. Further work should investigate this interesting possibility.</p><p>Acquisition or proliferation of di¡erent algal taxa has been suggested as a means by which a symbiotic association adapts to varying environmental factors . If sexual reproduction does occur, this might mean that environmental adaptations may also rely, to some extent, on the proliferation of adaptive alleles within the resident zooxanthellae population.</p><p>Such symbiont diversity might be useful to the clams in allowing them to establish associations with zooxanthellae suitable to the nutrient, temperature, and light conditions of their environment. Zooxanthellae, which thrive well under prevailing conditions, may outgrow pre-existing symbiont populations, and maintain the host's food supply. Variations in resident zooxanthellae taxa and numbers within a clam species might also be expected to occur from season to season, or between di¡erent depths and di¡erent light conditions. Observations of habitat-speci¢c symbioses in some Caribbean corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rowan &amp; Knowlton 1995)</ref> and the varying responses of di¡erent Symbiodinium species to changes in photon-£ux densities <ref type="bibr">(Iglesias-Prieto &amp; Trench 1994</ref> suggest that the algae may contribute to photoadaptation in symbiotic associations.</p><p>It should be noted that our allozyme analysis was limited to those zooxanthellae that grew in f/2 media, and therefore may represent a fraction of the total population within the host. It is likely that our analysis only uncovered a small portion of the total genetic variation in these populations. Indeed, our preliminary analysis of the same clonal cultures using random ampli¢cation of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) has demonstrated that all but a few clonal isolates are genetically distinguished by a single primer analysis (B. K. Baillie, V. Monje, V. Silvestre, M. Sison and C. A. <ref type="bibr">Belda-Bailey, unpublished data)</ref>. Such data, in addition to the present results, clearly demonstrate that algae within giant clams are genetically diverse. Further research should establish whether the source of this high genetic variation was clonal mutation or sexual recombination. If clonal mutation was indeed responsible for the variations detected here, symbiotic zooxanthellae probably have little need for sexual reproduction since the degree of genetic variation a¡orded by asexual reproduction is so large. Further study should also determine if the degree of variation detected in this study represents di¡erent algal taxa or individuals within a taxon. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg &amp; Trench (1980a)</ref> reported no detectable di¡erences in the allozyme patterns of clonal isolates from the same host species (i.e. various cnidarian host species, with one T. gigas host individual). The reason for this may be that the PAGE method used in our study was more sensitive and allowed the resolution and detection of more allozyme bands, which were not easily resolved or detected by SGE. Our initial di¤culties in resolving and detecting allozymes on starch gels, in contrast to PAGE, supports this premise. Separation by PAGE is on the basis of di¡erences in charge, molecular weight, and shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hames 1990)</ref>; whereas, separation of allozymes on starch gels is primarily due to charge di¡erences (May 1992). Our EST allozyme patterns (¢gure 1a) demonstrate an average of seven bands per isolate, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg &amp; Trench (1980a)</ref> reported an average of three for SGE. This is presumably due to the higher resolution available from PAGE.</p><p>(b) Current taxonomic groupings of symbiotic zooxanthellae <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rowan &amp; Knowlton (1995)</ref> have reported that more than one taxa of symbionts can occupy the same host. Our research has shown that it is also possible (at least for giant clams) that there is genetic variation between individuals within the same taxa.</p><p>Based on the 18S-rDNA sequences of various algal symbionts of cnidarian hosts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rowan &amp; Powers (1991a)</ref> demonstrated that symbiotic dino£agellates fall into three clades: A, B, and C. Zooxanthellae from tridacnid clams apparently fall within clade A of this scheme (Rowan's unpublished data cited in ). This clade also contains some symbionts from hard corals. Earlier work has indicated that zooxanthellae from clams fall within clades A and C (unpublished data mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rowan et al. (1996)</ref>).</p><p>It seems likely that our algal isolates fall within clade A. Our results demonstrate that clade A has a discernible sub-structure based on allozyme comparisons. Whilst 18S-rDNA sequence comparisons and RFLP of 18S-rDNA are able to distinguish symbiont taxa into three groups with some degree of substructure in clades B and C, it appears limited in its ability to resolve ¢ner details in clade A. We would expect, based on our present results and as more data are accumulated from 24S-rDNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and proteincoding genes, that clade A (and the others) will resolve into ¢ner details, revealing some of the broader details detected in our study.</p><p>If a signi¢cant proportion of the genetic variation in zooxanthellae is undetectable via 18S-rDNA, then the idea that there are only a small number of resident taxa may need to be extended to recognize the fact that the resident algal populations are genetically diverse. This may have implications for the ecological zonation reported in corals <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rowan &amp; Knowlton 1995)</ref>. RFLP analysis of 18S-rDNA may resolve only broad zonation e¡ects which occur in these symbioses.</p><p>The limitations of 18S-rDNA sequence and RFLP analysis to resolve clade A is presumably a function of the rate at which this gene evolves and the similarity of the algae involved. A similar problem is seen in the identi¢cation of bacterial species based on 16S-rDNA sequence analysis, where di¡erent organisms may share 16S-rDNA sequence identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fox et al. 1992)</ref>. This problem in Symbiodinium sp. identi¢cation has been acknowledged previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rowan &amp; Powers 1991a;</ref>.</p><p>Alternative methods for the analysis of Symbiodinium isolates appears to be the answer to this problem. In the case of 16S-rDNA, new methods using protein-coding genes such as the B subunit of DNA gyrase are being used successfully (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Yamamoto &amp; Harayama 1996)</ref>. For Symbiodinium isolates, analysis of the LSU-rDNA (Wilcox 1998; see  and the ITS region (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hunter et al. 1997)</ref> seem to be possible alternatives. The ¢nest details revealed by our allozyme analysis, however, will probably not be completely resolved by such methods since they appear to represent di¡erences between individual algae within a host.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(c) Clam mariculture applications</head><p>The dendrogram demonstrating the genetic similarities between clonal isolates shows several major branches, some of which may roughly correspond to species or strains. Such a tree is useful as it allows a logical choice of algal isolates to be made for use in infection trials. Choice of organisms for ¢eld trials is simpli¢ed, to some degree, by choosing organisms that are distantly related, hence ensuring the widest possible scope for the search for optimal symbionts. Once a suitable symbiont has been identi¢ed, other algae sharing the same clade may also have similar bene¢cial properties to host survival and growth.</p><p>For T. gigas, the success rate of growing clonal isolates in f/2 medium was much lower than that of any other species. This is circumstantial evidence suggesting that most of the algal symbionts of T. gigas may have nutrient requirements that are di¡erent from those of the symbionts of other clam species. Furthermore, analysis of the allozyme patterns revealed that the algal symbionts of T. gigas are more closely related to each other than to the symbionts of the other clam species. This observation is consistent with trends based on our preliminary RAPD analysis (B. K. Baillie, V. Monje, V. Silvestre, M. Sison and C. A. <ref type="bibr">Belda-Bailey, unpublished data)</ref>. We infer from these observations that the population of zooxanthellae symbiotic with T. gigas may be di¡erent and represent distinct zooxanthellae symbionts in giant clams. It would be interesting to test if symbionts from the fast-growing T. gigas would signi¢cantly improve the growth rates of slow-growing clam species (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Molea &amp; Munro 1994)</ref>.</p><p>The allozyme patterns from the FIZ of T. gigas are di¡erent from any of the 12 clonal isolates analysed (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg &amp; Trench 1980a)</ref>. This is probably due to the fact that our study was only able to investigate a small fraction of zooxanthellae from this clam species that would grow in f/2 medium. Therefore, it is possible that the bulk of the FIZ have allozyme patterns di¡erent from those of the clonal cultures. In addition, some di¡erences are likely due to the expression of di¡erent zooxanthellal allozymes in situ.</p><p>Most of the clonal cultures analysed were resolved based solely on their EST patterns. A similar situation was reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schoenberg &amp; Trench (1980a)</ref> for algae isolated from a diverse range of host taxa. The simplicity of EST staining and the PAGE method make these methods useful for routine analysis of clonal isolates.</p><p>We are continuing our investigation of zooxanthellae from giant clams using RAPD and ITS sequence analyses of the algal isolates to complement recent information from allozyme analysis. Work is also under way with zooxanthellae infection trials on clam larvae, which involves monitoring of juvenile growth and survival through short-term land-and ocean-based phases of clam culture. Among the interesting questions we further seek to address are: (i) do particular zooxanthellae improve clam performance; and (ii) do giant clams exchange or obtain new symbionts following initial infection? Results are forthcoming and will be reported later.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Isozyme patterns for clonal and freshly isolated zooxanthellae from giant clams.

			<abstract>
				<p>An integrin β subunit (FcβInt) cDNA was cloned from hemocytes of Fenneropenaeus chinensis by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR. The full-length cDNA of FcβInt consists of 2853 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 783 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point of 5.09. The deduced amino acid sequence of FcβInt possessed the classical domains of β integrin, including the βA domain and four epidermal-growth-factor (EGF)-like domains, which shared highest similarity with a β integrin of Pacifastacus leniusculus. The FcβInt mRNA was highly expressed in hemocytes, heart and gill, and moderately in gonad and intestine, whereas low expression level was found in muscle and hepatopancreas. FcβInt mRNA in gill was significantly up-regulated in 24 h and then gradually decreased below the control level in response to WSSV challenge. The cDNA fragment encoding the extracellular region of FcβInt (FcβInt-ER) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and polyclonal antibodies against recombinant FcβInt-ER (rFcβInt-ER) were produced, which could specifically react to the hemocyte membrane by immunofluorescence assay and recognize a 120 kDa protein in the hemocytes by western blotting. By ELISA and dot-blot binding assay, rFcβInt-ER exhibited specific WSSV binding activity. Neutralization assay in vivo further demonstrated that rFcβInt-ER could partially block WSSV infection to shrimp. These results suggested that FcβInt plays an important role in WSSV infection.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Integrins are a superfamily of heterodimeric cell surface receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions as well as bidirectional signal transduction between the cytosol and the extracellular matrix, which were formed by the noncovalent association of α and β subunits belonging to type-I transmembrane glycoproteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Takada et al., 2007)</ref>. These receptors are widely expressed in metazoans from sponges to humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hughes, 2001)</ref>. In mammals, there are 18 α and 8 β subunits identified to form at least 24 different receptors, the functional importance of which in the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis is well defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Humphries et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hynes, 2002)</ref>. In invertebrate, integrins were also reported to be responsible for cellular adhesive processes correlated with several immune responses, such as degranulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Johansson and Söderhäll, 1989)</ref>, phagocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mamali et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Terahara et al., 2006)</ref> and encapsulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Levin et al., 2005)</ref>. However, in comparison with mammalian, the role of invertebrate integrins in the innate immune system has not been well studied yet.</p><p>Integrins could recognize Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences displayed on the viral capsid proteins or extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which is the most widespread and prominent recognition sequence identified of the known integrin recognition motifs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ruoslahti, 1996)</ref>, so integrins become the prime examples of physiologically important receptors that have been usurped by a large number of viruses for attachment and/or cell entry, such as Adenovirus, Herpesvirus, Hantavirus, Picornavirus and Rotavirus <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Stewart and Nemerow, 2007)</ref>. The white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the most devastating shrimp pathogens found in farmed penaeid shrimp and other Crustacea, and it has caused serious damage to the worldwide shrimp culture industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Escobedo-Bonilla et al., 2008)</ref>. Previous study has shown that several major WSSV envelope proteins with the conserved integrin-binding motif RGD are involved in systemic infection of WSSV <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Li et al., 2006a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Li et al., , 2006b</ref>. Moreover, an integrin β subunit of Marsupenaeus japonicus was demonstrated to be involved in WSSV infection, however, only partial β integrin cDNA encoding βA domain was cloned and employed in the research <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Li et al., 2007a)</ref>, which might not reflected the potential biological functions of the β integrin in WSSV infection.</p><p>In order to clarify the potential roles of β integrin in WSSV infection, the present study intended to clone and characterize a full length cDNA sequence of Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis β integrin (FcβInt), and to investigate the relationship between FcβInt and WSSV infection by binding assay and neutralization assay.</p></div>

The haemolymph was obtained from ventral sinus using a syringe and immediately diluted with the modified Alsever's Solution (27 mM Nacitrate, 336 mM NaCl, 115 mM glucose, mM EDTA, pH 5.6), then hemocytes were collected by centrifuging at 680 g for 10 min at 4°C. The total hemocyte RNA was isolated with TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer's instruction and treated with RNasefree DNase (Promega RQ1 DNase I). A partial cDNA of β integrin was amplified by RT-PCR from shrimp hemocytes total RNA using degenerate primers, PinteF and PinteR <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, which were designed from the conserved sequence region coding von Willebrand factor (VWF) in other known β integrin sequences. The amplification was under the following conditions: denatured at 94°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of amplification (94°C for 30 s, 62°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s) and finally extended at 72°C for10 min. The partial amplified product was gel-purified, then subcloned into pMD19-T simple vector (Takara) and sequenced with the vector primers M-47 and M-Rv.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Full-length cDNA cloning of β integrin</head><p>According to the partial sequence information, two gene specific sense primers, InteF1 and InteF2 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, were designed for 3′ Race, and two gene specific anti-sense primers, InteR1 and InteR2 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>, were designed for 5′ Race. The cDNA sequence of β integrin was extended by 5′ and 3′ RACE-PCR using SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 5′ and 3′ RACE products were gel-purified using a DNA Extraction Kit (Bioteke, China) and TA-cloned into pMD19-T vector (Takara, Japan). The clones with the correct size of insert were sequenced by Shanghai Sangon Biotechnology Company. By ligation of the two overlapping cDNA fragments, the full-length FcβInt cDNA was obtained.</p></div>

The protein motif features were predicted by the PSORT II program analysis (National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan) and Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/). The potential N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation sites were predicted using NetNGlyc 1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/NetNGlyc/) and NetOGlyc 3.1 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/NetOGlyc/). The ClustalW Multiple Alignment program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) was used to create the multiple sequence alignment. An unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the sequences alignment by the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm using the Mega3.1 program. The reliability of the branching was tested by using bootstrap re-sampling (1000 pseudo-replicates).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Tissue distribution of β integrin mRNA</head><p>The mRNA expression of β integrin in different tissues of healthy shrimp was measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from three replicates of different tissues of healthy shrimp, including hemocytes, heart, intestine, muscle, gill, hepatopancreas and gonad. The first-strand synthesis was carried out based on M-MLV RTase instuctions (Takara) using the DNase-treated total RNA as template. Two β integrin specific primers InteF3 and InteR3 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref> were used to amplify a product of 650 bp, while a pair of β-actin primers, AF and AR <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref> were used to amplify 11,284 bp fragment as an internal control. The PCR reactions were performed at 94°C for min, and followed by 30 cycles (for FcβInt) or 25 cycles (for actin) of 94°C for 30 s, 57°C for 30 s, 72°C for 60 s and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min.

Briefly, 1 g gill tissue of natural heavily infected F. chinensis was homogenized in 10 ml PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 600 g for 20 min at 4°C, the supernatant was passed through a 450 nm membrane filter to obtain the CE-WSSV. Healthy shrimp, each weighing approximately 15 g, were injected with 30 μl of CE-WSSV at the dilution of 1:1000 in PBS.

RT-PCR reactions was performed under above condition, PCR products mixed with loading buffer were electrophoretically separated on 1% agarose gel and was visualized with ethidium bromide. The agarose gel image was captured by using Bio-Rad image system. The density of each DNA band was quantified with Bio-Rad one quantity software analysis system. The ratio of each band to control band represented the relative quantity of FcβInt mRNA expression. Statistical analysis of FcβInt/β-actin ratios for mRNA expression was performed using one-way ANOVA by SPSS 11.5 software, and results were described as means ± SD. Multiple comparisons were performed using the Bonferroni t procedure and single comparisons using Student's t test. Probability values less than 0.05 were regarded as significant.</p></div>

The purified PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes and inserted into pET32a plasmid to generate pET32a-FcβInt-ER recombinant. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The positive clones were screened by PCR and confirmed by sequencing, then incubated in LB medium and induced with 0.8 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactosidase (IPTG). The recombinant FcβInt-ER (rFcβInt-ER) was purified by Ni 2+ -affinity column (HiTrap HP column, GE) as described by the manufacturer's instruction, and dialyzed against PBS. As a negative control, pET-32a vector, producing the Trx/His/S-tag fusion protein, was transformed into BL21 (DE3) and treated in parallel. The samples, including non-induced BL21, induced BL21, purified rβIntegrin-ER and purified Trx/His/S-tag fusion protein, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with coomassie brilliant blue R250. The concentration of rβIntegrin-ER protein and Trx/His/S-tag fusion protein was determined by Bradford assay.</p></div>

The polyclonal antibody obtained was then purified by protein G agarose (Pharmacia) affinity chromatography and characterized by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and western blotting. For IFA, Chinese shrimp hemocytes were collected as described above, then suspended in PBS. The cell suspensions were settled onto glass sliders, after 30 min subsiding, the hemocytes were fixed with acetone for 15 min. The slides were overlaid with the mouse anti-rFcβInt-ER antibodies and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a moist chamber. After washing thrice with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20), the slides were incubated for 1 h in the dark with FITCconjugated goat anti-mouse Ig serum (Sigma) diluted at 1:200 in PBS. Washed thrice with PBST, the slides were mounted and examined by fluorescence microscope. The anti-rFcβInt-ER antibody was replaced by Mouse anti-Trx/His/S-tag antibodies as negative control. For Western blotting, the induced E. coli BL21 containing pET32a-FcβInt-ER and shrimp hemocytes were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with PBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 37°C, and incubated with mouse anti-rFcβInt-ER antibody for 1 h at 37°C. After washing thrice with PBST, the membrane was incubated with goat-anti-mouse Ig-alkaline phosphatase conjugate diluted 1:4000 in PBS for 1 h at 37°C. Positive bands were stained with substrate solution (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris and 5 mM MgCl , pH 9.5) containing nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT, Sigma) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyphosphate (BCIP, Sigma) for 10 min and stopped by washing with distilled water.

Determination of binding specificity of rFcβInt-ER to WSSV by ELISA and dot-blotting WSSV was purified from the gills of natural heavily infected F. chinensis according to the previous method <ref type="bibr">(Wang and Zhan, 2006a)</ref>. Mab 1D5 recognized epitopes on the envelope of WSSV was purified from the ascitic fluid of BALB/c mice according to the previous study in our laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zhan et al., 1999)</ref>. The concentration of the purified MAb 1D5 was adjusted to 1 mg/ml and labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using a commercial FastLink HRP Labeling Kit (ABNOVA, Taiwan), then stored at −80°C for later use.</p><p>Detected by ELISA, the wells of 96-well ELISA plates were coated with purified rFcβInt-ER (10 μg/well) in 100 μl of 0.01 M PBS in triple and incubated overnight at 4°C.

After washing thrice, 100 ml per well of HRP-conjugated MAb 1D5 (1:1000 dilution) was added and incubated for h at 37°C. After washing as above, 100 μl of soluble Tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) Substrate Solution (GalaxyBio, Jinan, China) was added to each well for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 M H 2 SO 4 and read at nm in an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices).

After washing thrice with PBST, 100 μl WSSV suspension per well (100 μg/ml) was added and incubated for 2 h at 22°C. After washing thrice, 100 ml per well of HRP-conjugated MAb 1D5 (1:1000 dilution) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washing as above, the positive reactions were visualized using precipitate TMB substrate solution (GalaxyBio, Jinan, China) for 5 min, then the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 M H 2 SO 4 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9.">Neutralization assay in vivo</head><p>In order to test whether rFcβInt-ER could block WSSV infection in shrimp, purified rFcβInt-ER (0.5 mg/ml) was mixed with CE-WSSV at the dilution of 1:1000 in equal volume, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Then the mixture was injected intramuscularly into freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in the lateral area of the fourth abdominal segment at 50 μl per shrimp using a 1 ml sterile syringe. WSSV mixed with Trx/His/S-tag was used as a control. Shrimps injected with PBS were regarded as a negative control. Each treatment was replicated with three batches of 20 shrimp. Mortality was recorded daily, and gills of dead shrimp were tested for the presence of WSSV by PCR as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Rout et al., 2005)</ref>.</p></div>

The calculated molecular weight of the mature peptide is 86.8 kDa. The full-length cDNA sequence of β integrin was deposited in GenBank under accession no. GU370128.</p><p>A signal peptide identified by the PSORT II program was at N-terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence of β integrin and the putative cleavage site was located after position 23 (ASA-QE). The mature peptide of 783 amino acids is predicted to consist of an extracellular, a trans-membrane and a cytoplasmic domain of 711, 23 and 49 amino acids, respectively <ref type="figure">(Figs. 1 and 2)</ref>. FcβInt contains potential N-glycosylation sites, one Thr-O-glycosylation sites and 44 phosphorylation sites <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>.</p><p>SMART prediction revealed that the extracellular region of FcβInt contained a 419-residue conserved domain called INB (Integrin_beta) (amino acids # 32-450) ( <ref type="figure">Figs. 1 and 2)</ref>. In the INB domain, there is an I-like domain (also called βA domain) (amino acids # 132-361), which is a member of the type A domain superfamily containing a prototype molecule called von Willebrand factor (vWF) <ref type="figure">(Figs. 1 and  2)</ref>. Proteins with vWF domain participate in numerous biological events, and interact with a large array of ligands <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Colombatti et al., 1993)</ref>. A metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) (amino acids # 141-145) with a DXSXS motif, which has been suggested as the ligand-binding site, is found in the βA domain of FcβInt <ref type="figure">(Figs. 1 and  2)</ref>. A PSI (plexin-semaphorin-integrin) domain (amino acids # 26-77) is also found in the INB domain <ref type="figure">(Figs. 1 and 2)</ref>. The remainder of the extracellular portion of the FcβInt between the βA domain and the membrane-spanning region contains four cysteine-rich, epidermal-growth-factor (EGF)-like domains. In the cytoplasmic domain, two NPX(Y/F) motifs (amino acids # 813-816 and 825-828) are identified, which are highly conserved in β-integrins of invertebrates, and are suggested to have an important role in activating integrins via inducing conformational changes <ref type="figure">(Figs. 1 and 2)</ref>. A membrane-proximal sequences (LLv-iHDR motif) was also found, which play an important role in affinity modulation of integrins <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hughes and Pfaff, 1998)</ref>. Altogether, these results suggest that FcβInt has similar domain structures as those in integrin β subunits of other invertebrate.</p></div>

An incomplete M. japonicus cDNA in the database of patented sequences (accession ABI78938) shared 78% identity with FcβInt. However, FcβInt shared less similarity with vertebrate β integrins. Multiple alignments of FcβInt with several invertebrate integrins showed that FcβInt displayed several highly conserved features possessed by integrin β subunits <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>, including βA domain, MIDAS motif, epidermal-growth-factor (EGF)-like domains and NPX(Y/F) motif. The phylogenetic relationships between FcβInt and other integrins were also analyzed by neighbor-joining tree using full amino acid sequences. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref>, β-integrins of anthropod formed one major cluster, and the β subuints of lower invertebrates including shellfish (Crassostrea gigas), carol (Acropora millepora) and sponge (Geodia cydonium) were grouped out of the anthropod cluster.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The integrins are a superfamily of cell adhesion receptors that recognize mainly extracellular matrix ligands, cell-surface ligands and some soluble ligands, which have key roles in normal cell physiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hynes, 2002)</ref>. In mammals, the integrins have been proved to play an important role in immune responses, such as platelet-mediated blood clotting and T-cell activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Shimaoka and Springer, 2003)</ref>. By contrast, the role of invertebrate integrins in innate immune system, have not been well studied yet. Whereas, several researches have shown that the integrins in invertebrate could participate in regulating cellular immune reactions such as melanization, phagocytosis, nodulation and encapsulation in response to foreign invasion or injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Lavine and Strand, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mamali et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Zhuang et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>In present study, an integrin β subunit (FcβInt) cDNA was cloned from hemocytes of F. chinensis by RACE technique. Blast analysis revealed that FcβInt has the highest sequence identity (72%) with β integrin from P. leniusculus (PlβInt), but shared only 62% identity with β-integrin from L. vannamei (LvβInt), which is much closer with F. chinensis than P. leniusculus in traditional taxonomy. Consistently, phylogenetic analysis also revealed that FcβInt and PlβInt formed a tight cluster, and LvβInt was grouped out <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4)</ref>. This result suggested that there are at least two different subtypes of β subunit in the shrimps of the family Penaeidae. Structural analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed that FcβInt has similar domains and motifs to the other β subunits from invertebrates, including a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, an βA domain, four epidermalgrowth-factor (EGF)-like domains and two NPX(Y/F) motifs <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Lavine and Strand, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Levin et al., 2005)</ref>. βA domain contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), which may activate integrin for cell adhesion and migration during the encapsulation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Colombatti et al., 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Localization of integrins has been well studied in mammals, some integrins are limited to certain cell types or tissues. For example, the β2 integrin was present exclusively on the surface of leukocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Takada et al., 2007)</ref>. However, till now, there was no report about the tissue distribution of integrin mRNA in crustaceans. In present study, RT-PCR analysis showed that the FcβInt mRNA was expressed    in various tissues, but at different levels. The strongest expression was observed in the hemocytes, whereas, the lowest expression was seen in the muscle and hepatopancreas. Similarly, β1 integrin mRNA in an insect Ostrinia furnacalis was expressed primarily in hemocytes, especially in plasmatocytes, and weakly in other tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hu et al., 2010)</ref>. β1 integrin mRNA in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta was only detected in hemocytes by Northern analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Levin et al., 2005)</ref>. Abundant expression of β integrin in hemocytes indicated that integrins might play important roles in cell-mediated immune response in invertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Zhuang et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In order to identify the native FcβInt in shrimp hemocytes, antiserum against a recombinant extracellular region of β integrin (amino acids 1-711) was prepared. IFA confirmed that the antibodies could react with the membrane of hemocytes. Western blotting assay showed that the polyclonal antibodies could react strongly with a 120 kDa protein and weakly reacted with a 55 kDa protein in hemocytes. It's well known that the basic structure of integrins is a heterodimeric complex of one 130-200 kDa α subunit linked noncovalently to one 90-130 kDa β subunit, so the 120 kDa was probably the native FcβInt in shrimp hemocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ruoslahti and Pierschbacher, 1987)</ref>. However, the apparent mass of the 120 kDa protein was larger than the calculated mass of FcβInt (86.8 kDa), which might be due to posttranslational modifications of FcβInt, because deduced amino acid sequence of FcβInt contains 3 N-glycosylation sites, 1 O-glycosylation site and 44 phosphorylation sites by bioinformation analysis. Similarly, a β subunit of hemocytes integrin from crayfish has been cloned with a theoretical MW of 88.4 kDa, and the corresponding polypeptide of about 110 kDa was identified in hemocytes membranes by immunoblot <ref type="bibr">(Holmblad Fig. 7</ref>. Characterization of polyclonal antibodies against rFcβInt-ER by IFA and western blotting. A, immunofluorescence staining of F. chinensis hemocytes using antibodies against rFcβInt-ER (bar = 50 μm); B, immunofluorescence staining of F. chinensis hemocytes using antibodies against Trx/His/S-tag as negative control (bar = 50 μm). C, identification of FcβInt in F. chinensis hemocytes by western blotting. Lane M, protein molecular standard; lane 1, SDS-PAGE of hemocytes; lane 2, antibodies against rFcβInt-ER reacted with hemocyte proteins; lane 3, antibodies against Trx/His/S-tag was used as negative control. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref>. Purified WSSV was examined by negative staining electron microscopy (bar = 500 nm). <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Detection of the binding interaction between rFcβInt-ER and WSSV by ELISA (A) and dot-blot (B). 1, WSSV incubated with rFcβInt-ER; 2, WSSV incubated with Trx/His/S-tag fusion protein; 3, BSA incubated with rFcβInt-ER. <ref type="bibr">et al., 1997)</ref>. In insect, β1 subunit from hemocytes of O. furnacalis was cloned with a theoretical MW of 88.7 kDa, and the corresponding polypeptide of about 120 kDa has also been identified in hemocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Hu et al., 2010)</ref>. So, it is likely that the cloned FcβInt indeed corresponds to the 120 kDa protein in hemocytes recognized by the antibodies.</p><p>To date, at least WSSV envelope proteins (VP31, VP36A, VP36B, VP110, VP187, and VP281) have been reported to contain the RGD motif, which potentially involved in virus binding to cell surface integrins (Sánchez-Paz, 2010). Since the extracellular domains of many integrins have the ability to bind to the RGD motif <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Stewart and Nemerow, 2007)</ref>, FcβInt-ER was recombinantly expressed in E. coli BL21 in present study, which exhibited specific WSSV binding activity in vitro by ELISA and dot-blot binding assays and could partially block WSSV infection to freshwater crayfish in vivo in neutralization assay. The neutralization of FcβInt-ER significantly, but incompletely, blocked the WSSV infection, suggesting that other receptors for WSSV may be present. Consistently, previous study also showed that a β integrin of M. japonicus could block the WSSV infection in vivo and in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Li et al., 2007a)</ref>. These results indicate that FcβInt is involved in WSSV infection and may function as a cellular receptor or "post-attachment" receptors or co-receptors for WSSV.</p><p>Modulation of integrin expression during virus infection would alter the intercellular and extracellular binding properties of infected cells and have profound effects on cell survival and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Halasz et al., 2008)</ref>. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection could lead to a significant up-regulation of β1 integrin receptors expression on the human prostate tumor cell line PC3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Blaheta et al., 2006)</ref>. Dengue virus serotype 2 infection could also induce up-regulating expression of β3 integrin in human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line-1, which was required for virus entry <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Zhang et al., 2007)</ref>. Consistently, expression of FcβInt was up-regulated in shrimp gill after WSSV infection, and reached about 4.5 times of that in the uninfected shrimp. In addition, it is noteworthy that strong inhibitory effects on WSSV infection could be achieved by down-regulation expression of β integrin in M. japonicus <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Li et al., 2007a)</ref>. It has also been reported that hemocytes of shrimp was one of the important target cells for WSSV <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Wang et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zhan et al., 1999)</ref>. Taken together, it is interesting to speculate that up-regulation expression of FcβInt acted as a potential receptor might facilitate WSSV entry and infection.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that has demonstrated that WSSV infection could induce high expression level of β integrin in shrimp. As integrin is a heterodimeric protein composed of α and β subunits, and there are no α subunits found in crustacean until now, so we are only beginning to elucidate the roles of integrins in the WSSV infection and invertebrate immune system. <ref type="figure">Fig. 10</ref>.

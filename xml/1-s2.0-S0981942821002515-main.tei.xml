			<abstract>
				<p>Heavy metal (HM) accumulation in the agricultural soil and its toxicity is a major threat for plant growth and development. HMs disrupt functional integrity of the plants, induces altered phenological and physiological responses and slashes down qualitative crop yield. Chemical messengers such as phytohormones, plant growth regulators and gasotransmitters play a crucial role in regulating plant growth and development under metal toxicity in plants. Understanding the intricate network of these chemical messengers as well as interactions of genes/metabolites/proteins associated with HM toxicity in plants is necessary for deciphering insights into the regulatory circuit involved in HM tolerance. The present review describes (a) the role of chemical messengers in HM-induced toxicity mitigation, (b) possible crosstalk between phytohormones and other signaling cascades involved in plants HM tolerance and (c) the recent advancements in biotechnological interventions including genetic engineering, genome editing and omics approaches to provide a step ahead in making of improved plant against HM toxicities.</p>

The concentration and distribution of auxin alters in response to exposure of HMs such as Zn, cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and copper (Cu) <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Luo et al., 2016)</ref>. Auxin helps in detoxification mechanism and prevents oxidative damage by reducing excess ROS accumulation in plants caused due to metalloid toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Singh et al., 2021)</ref>. On exposure to detrimental levels of HMs, transcript abundances of several auxin responsive genes get altered along with the activation of a feedback auxin homeostasis pathway to maintain auxin levels in plants for enhanced adaptability to HM toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">(Wang et al., 2015a)</ref>. Plant roots are the primary organ that is exposed to soil contaminated with HMs and thus act as an essential criterion to be characterized for deciphering HM stress signalling and perception. Auxin plays an important role in regulating root architecture as inferred by the increased Cd sensitivity of AUX1 mutants (osAUX1) in rice (Oryza sativa) that resulted in enhanced reduction of primary and lateral root system while the exogenous application of analogue of auxin reversed the Cd induced adversities in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">(Yu et al., 2015)</ref>. Auxin transporter i.e., AUX1 regulates auxin transport and signalling and influences cell division and elongation that ultimately affects root growth under arsenite stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Krishnamurthy and Rathinasabapathi, 2013)</ref>.

Role of auxin in phytoextraction of HMs such as Pb and Zn was observed in sunflower (Helianthus annuus) where the exogenous supplementation of IAA in various concentrations (0-10 − 9 M) significantly reduced metals-induced adversities in plant growth and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Fassler et al., 2010)</ref>. Despite of substantial process in studies related to auxin mediated HM tolerance, challenging aspects of auxin-mediated HM tolerance need to be explored.</p></div>

Exogenous application of CK resulted in mitigation of HM stress in commercially important plants such as maize (Zea mays), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and eggplant (Solanum melongena; <ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Singh and Prasad, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b219">Singh et al., 2018)</ref>. CK plays an important role in As metal detoxification as there exists a linear correlation between enhanced expression of cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogease 1 (CKX1) and the decrease in CK level that further leads to accumulation of PCs and GSH <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">(Mohan et al., 2016)</ref>.

Exogenous application of CK (10 μM) mitigated Cd induced damages in plant tissues, improved plant growth and enhanced the activity of enzymatic antioxidants including APX, GR, dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) as well as non-enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbate + DHA and GSH + glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in tomato seedlings <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">(Singh et al., 2018)</ref>. However, the action of CK on HM stress mitigation in plants is yet not known well, therefore further insights into researches based on CK-mediated HM stress tolerance could help in developing HM tolerant plants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Heavy metals and gibberellins</head><p>Phytohormone, GA is a tetracyclic diterpenoid that also has a pivotal role in the governing physiological and molecular processes in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b263">(Yamaguchi, 2008)</ref>. Among its role as an important chemical messenger in plants during abiotic stresses <ref type="bibr">(Niharika and Singh, 2021b)</ref>, GA-mediated regulation of plant growth during HM toxicity is an interesting aspect to be discussed. GA mediates plant growth and development during HM stress conditions by ameliorating membrane integrity, changing source-sink dynamics, influencing cell division processes and by improving detoxification mechanism in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Iqbal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Emamverdian et al., 2020)</ref>. Exogenous application of GA 3 counteracted the Pb and Cd induced damages in broad bean (Vicia faba), improved mitotic activity, yielded seed protein and RNA contents and carbohydrate metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Mansour and Kamel, 2005)</ref>. During Cd stress condition, exogenous supplementation of GA (5 μM) alleviated Cd toxicity induced adversities in Arabidopsis plant by repressing the activity of iron regulated transporters (IRT1) that also enhance Cd uptake in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b295">(Zhu et al., 2012)</ref>. GA has shown its functional interplay with Ca 2+ signalling pathway that further aid in amelioration of HM tolerance in plants. Application of GA in combination with Ca 2+ to nickel (Ni)-stressed wheat (Triticum aestivum) significantly improved plant traits such as height, biomass, dry weight, chlorophyll content, activity of antioxidant enzymes along with enhanced proline content <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">(Siddiqui et al., 2011)</ref>. Combined application of phytohormones such as GA and IAA (5 mM) along with proline (10 mM) and compost (40 t ha − 1 ) significantly mitigated Pb stress in maize <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adejumo et al., 2020)</ref>. The application of GA also reversed the toxic effects of Cr on plant growth and ammonium assimilation in pea seedlings by the upregulating the activity of antioxidant system and maintaining redox balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Gangwar et al., 2011)</ref>. Exogenous application of GA also alleviated Cd-induced toxic effects on growth and germination of seeds of rapeseed (Brassica napus; <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Meng et al., 2009)</ref> and Cd and Pb-induced adversities in broad bean and lupin plants (Lupinus albus; <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Sharaf et al., 2009)</ref>.

Under As toxicity, the genes involved in ABA biosynthesis and its signalling such as OsPP2Cs, OsbZIP10 (OsABI5), OsbZIP12 (OsABF1), Osb-ZIP66 (OsABF5), and OsbZIP72 (OsABF4) are induced in rice plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Huang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">Yu et al., 2012)</ref>. Moreover, the enhanced expression of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1 (NCED1) and synthesis of ABA in response to the Cd stress in potato lead to PC accumulation while the treatment with a non-specific inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis (fluridone; Flu) significantly reduced endogenous ABA level <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">(Stroinski et al., 2013)</ref>. Interestingly, Arabidopsis plants inoculated with Rhodococcus qingshengi (ABA catabolizing bacteria) shows increase in the accumulation of Cd (72%), Zn (46%), and Ni (50%) in shoots and the increase is more pronounce in ABA sensitive mutants (abi1/hab1/abi2) and less pronounced in ABA insensitive mutant (snrk 2.2/2.3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Lu et al., 2020a)</ref>.</p><p>ABA supplementation reduces metal toxicity in Ni stressed rice plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Rubio et al., (1994)</ref>, reduces Cd levels in Cd stressed Arabidopsis and Euphrates poplar (Populus euphratica; <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Fan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Han et al., 2016)</ref>. It has been also reported that the exogenous supplementation of ABA to Populus x Canescens reduces Zn concentration via the downregulation of genes associated with Zn uptake and detoxification <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">(Shi et al., 2015)</ref>. ABA mediates three major pathways that include inhibition of the uptake, altering the translocation from root to shoot, and promoting the conjugation with chelators under HM <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Hu et al., 2020)</ref>. The Cu-induced enhanced level of ABA led to the accumulation of osmolytes such as proline and reduction in ROS scavenging in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Chen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b206">Sharma and Dietz, 2006)</ref>.

Transcriptional factors of basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) subfamily also activated PCS transcription in Gray poplar (Populus × canescens) in response to exogenously supplemented ABA <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">(Shi et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Rubio et al.

Besides, ABA pre-treatment also dramatically reduce Cd accumulation in the leaves of Indian mustard <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">(Salt et al., 1995)</ref>. Similarly, the exogenous application of ABA limits the root-to-shoot translocation of Cd in Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">(Perfus-Barbeoch et al., 2002)</ref>. Also, less Cd accumulation was detected in parallel to reduced transpiration rate and stomatal closure with up to 100 μM ABA treatment in Indian mustard, rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis helleri; <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Salt et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b288">Zhao et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b241">Uraguchi et al., 2009)</ref>. During Pb stress tolerance, stomatal closure and a decreased transpiration ratio were observed in the pea leaves with Pb exposure parallel to elevated amount of endogenous ABA <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">(Parys et al., 1998)</ref>. Thus, it can be inferred that ABA-induced stomatal closure causes a suppression of transpiration flow and may result in a restriction of root-to-shoot translocation of metals. Several metal transporters are also believed to participate in ABA induced metal translocation.

The increase in lateral roots was correlated with a corresponding increase in auxin accumulation in transgenic lines as compared to wild type plants that further strengthens the role of lateral roots in Cr tolerance. A part from that, a significant increase in antioxidant activity and proline accumulation, which was probably mediated by SA signalling in the OsMYB-R1 over-expressing lines, were also believed to be the contributing factors underlying Cr tolerance in the transgenic rice.

Plants acclimate to thrive in such harsh conditions by inducing expression of several stress responsive genes, proteins and metabolites; activating antioxidant machinery and sequester excess of metal ions by producing chelators such as PCs, GSH and MTs. Classical phytohormones, PGRs and gasotransmitters coordinate in several cellular and metabolic processes in the plants to mediate plant responses to HM stress adversities. Besides, there is an interesting crosstalk between phytohormones and the gasotransmitters during HM stress that means both chemical messengers are involved in a functional interplay to control plant stress responses and enhanced tolerance. Various strategies to reduce the crop loss due to metal toxicity are being adopted for production of stress resilient plants using the combined approaches of biotechnological and omics tools. However, there are still many more that remains unidentified and can be deciphered as well as manipulated using appropriate omics and genetic engineering tools to assist in development of HM resilient plants in near future.</p></div>

			<abstract>
				<p>The colorful outer mantle of giant clams contains abundance of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) and iridocytes, and has direct exposure to light. In light, photosynthesizing dinoflagellates produce O 2 , and the host cells in the outer mantle would be confronted with hyperoxia-related oxidative stress. In comparison, the whitish inner mantle contains few symbiotic dinoflagellates and no iridocytes. It is involved in shell formation, and is shaded from light. CuZnSOD is a cytosolic enzyme that scavenges intracellular O 2 %-. We had obtained from the outer mantle of the fluted giant clam, Tridacna squamosa, the complete cDNA coding sequence of a host-derived copper zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), which comprised 462 bp and encoded for 154 amino acids with a calculated MW of 15.6 kDa. CuZnSOD was expressed strongly in the outer mantle, ctenidium, hepatopancreas and kidney. The transcript level of CuZnSOD remained unchanged in the outer mantle during light exposure, but the protein abundance of CuZnSOD increased~3-fold after exposure to light for 6 or 12 h. By contrast, 12 h of light exposure had no significant effects on the gene and protein expression levels of CuZnSOD/CuZnSOD in the inner mantle. Hence, the increased expression of CuZnSOD in the outer mantle of T. squamosa was probably a host&apos;s response to ameliorate oxidative stress related to photosynthesis in the symbionts, and not simply due to increased metabolic rate in the host cells. Evidently, the host clam must possess light-or O-responsive antioxidative defenses in order to align with the light-dependent photosynthetic activity of its symbionts.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Although tropical waters are deficient in nutrient and low in plankton content partly due to a lack of overturn <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(De Goeij et al., 2013)</ref>, giant clams (family: Cardiidae, subfamily: Tridacninae) grow well in reef waters of the Indo-Pacific <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Klumpp et al., 1992)</ref>. This is because they possess symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) of the genera Symbiodinium, Cladocopium, Durusdinium and Gerakladium, singly or in various combinations and proportions as defined by the environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Trench, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">LaJeunesse et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pochon et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Guibert et al., 2020)</ref>. These symbionts reside extracellularly inside a specialized tubular system <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Norton et al., 1992)</ref> that originates from the host's digestive tract as a primary tube. The primary tube gives rise to many smaller secondary and tertiary tubules. While the tiny tertiary tubules permeate many organs, they are found mainly in the fleshy and colorful outer mantle, which is extensible for full exposure to light <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Norton et al., 1992)</ref>. The outer mantle is brightly colored, as it consists of iridophores that compose iridocytes containing stacks of tiny platelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Griffiths et al., 1992)</ref>. Iridocytes are located mainly in the upper 200 μm of the outer mantle and in very close proximity to the symbionts. Their platelets can scatter light of appropriate wavelengths to the symbionts while back-reflecting light of non-productive wavelengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Holt et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ghoshal et al., 2016)</ref>. Iridocytes can also absorb short-wavelength UV lights and remit them at longer wavelengths conducive for photosynthesis in the symbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rossbach et al., 2020)</ref>. In comparison, the inner mantle adjacent to the extrapallial fluid is thin and whitish, and plays an important role in shell formation (calcification). The host supplies symbiotic dinoflagellates with inorganic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to support their metabolism and growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Furla et al., 2005)</ref>. In return, symbionts share with the host photosynthates <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Muscatine, 1990</ref>) that can fully satisfy the host's energy and nutritional needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fisher et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Klumpp et al., 1992)</ref>. Because of that, the fluted giant clam, Tridacna squamosa, can survive and grow in Millipore-filtered seawater for more than 10 months with light as the sole energy source despite being deprived of access to planktonic/particulate matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fitt and Trench, 1981)</ref>. It has been proposed that the supply of O 2 and photosynthates by the symbionts can boost the generation of ATP in the host to sustain the operation of Plasma Membrane Ca 2+ -ATPase (PMCA) in the inner mantle during light-enhanced shell formation <ref type="bibr">(Ip et al., 2017aa)</ref>.</p><p>Molecular O 2 is non-cytotoxic at its ground state. However, after gaining an extra electron, it can turn into a highly reactive superoxide radical, O 2 % -, which is a type of reactive oxygen species (ROS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Scandalios, 1997)</ref>. Many cellular reactions, including aerobic respiration and photosynthesis, generate O 2 %as a by-product, and O %can in turn generate other ROS such as hydrogen peroxide, hydroxy radical and singlet oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Perry et al., 2010)</ref>. ROS, at controlled levels, participate in apoptosis, signaling, oxidative bursts in immune cells, as well as cell growth and adhesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boonstra and Post, 2004)</ref>. However, imbalance between production and degradation of ROS could result in the accumulation of ROS leading to oxidative damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Candas and Li, 2014)</ref>. It has been established that ROS production can be augmented by high light intensity, UV radiation and extreme temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Scandalios, 2005)</ref>, and accumulating ROS can damage DNA, proteins and lipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hermes-Lima, 2004)</ref>, and even alters the rate of senescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Harman, 1956)</ref>.</p><p>Cells can detoxify ROS enzymatically or by anti-oxidants <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Birben et al., 2012)</ref>. In particular, the enzyme superoxide dismutases (SODs; EC 1.15.1.1.) scavenge O 2 % -, and dismutate two molecules of O 2 %to H 2 O 2 . Then, H 2 O 2 is detoxified to H 2 O and O 2 catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase or catalase <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Scandalios, 2005)</ref>. The removal of O 2 %prevents the formation of ROS and thus ameliorates the potential damage caused by excess ROS. SODs can be categorized into three classes, each with a specific catalytic metal ion and distinct peptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Perry et al., 2010)</ref>. Copper-zinc superoxide dismutases (CuZnSODs) constitute one class of SODs that are predominantly cytoplasmic, although some are located in the compartment between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Sturtz et al., 2001)</ref>, while manganese superoxide dismutases (MnSODs) form another class of SODs that are generally located in the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotes.</p><p>Animals and their tissues can be exposed to disparate levels of PO 2 under different physiological and/or environmental conditions. For instance, animals living in sunlit algal pools may encounter hyperoxia (atmospheric PO 2 &gt; 21 kPa) when O is enriched by algal photosynthesis. Animal tissues can also be confronted with high PO 2 , when respiratory rate outpaces O 2 consumption. ROS production increases in insects exposed to pure O 2 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beckman and Ames, 1998)</ref>, resulting in the accumulation of carbonyl proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Sohal and Dubey, 1994)</ref> and the impairment of certain mitochondrial enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Walker and Benzer, 2004)</ref>. Cells cultured at high PO 2 also increase the generation of ROS, leading to genomic instability, DNA impairment, and senescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Jagannathan et al., 2016)</ref>. In comparison, giant clams are atypical as they possess extracellular symbiotic dinoflagellates that conduct photosynthesis and produce O 2 inside the animal's body during insolation. Because of that, hemolymph sampled from tissue sinuses of illuminated giant clams contains gas bubbles resulting from supersaturation of O 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Leggat et al., 1999)</ref>. O 2 produced by the extracellular dinoflagellates would diffuse across the plasma membrane of host cells into their cytoplasm and lead to the formation of ROS therein. As the outer mantle of giant clams contains the highest density of symbionts <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Norton et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Poo et al., 2020)</ref>, it would theoretically have the greatest needs to deal with possible oxidative damage. However, how the outer mantle ameliorates possible oxidative damage attributable to hyperoxia generated by photosynthesizing symbionts remains enigmatic at present. Therefore, this study was undertaken to clone, sequence and characterize CuZnSOD/CuZnSOD from the colorful outer mantle of the fluted giant clam, T. squamosa, as we hypothesized that a cytosolic type of host SOD could be involved to deal with the ROS derived from hyperoxia generated by photosynthesized symbiotic dinoflagellates. Tridacna squamosa happens to be a deep water dwelling species, and its depth of occurrence ranges from 11 m to 20 m <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Jantzen et al., 2008)</ref>. Of note, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jantzen et al. (2008)</ref> exposed T. squamosa to a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPDF) of 128 ± 59 μmol photons m −2 s −1 , corresponding to the actual light intensity at~20 m water depth, in their study, and Poo et al. (2020) also exposed T. squamosa to an underwater light intensity of 120 μmol photons m −2 s −1 to determine the phototrophic potential of dinoflagellates in five organs, including the extensible outer mantle. Hence, individuals of T. squamosa were exposed to an underwater PPDF of 120 μmol photons m −2 s −1 in this study. A molecular approach was adopted in this study because traditional enzymatic assays would not be able to differentiate the host SOD from the symbiont SOD, and it would be difficult to obtain pure host tissue extracts without contamination of dinoflagellates, particularly for the outer mantle. Based on molecular analyses, the identity of the sequenced CuZnSOD and its host origin were confirmed by phenogramic and sequence similarity analyses. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transcript and protein expression levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Boo et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cao-Pham et al., 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hiong et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hiong et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ip et al., 2017a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ip et al., , 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ip et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Koh et al., 2018)</ref>, or only the protein abundance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cao-Pham et al., 2019a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">: Chan et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chew et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hiong et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Poo et al., 2020)</ref> of many transporters are upregulated in the ctenidium, outer mantle and inner mantle of T. squamosa in response to illumination, in order to align with photosynthetic activities in the symbiotic dinoflagellates. Therefore, efforts were made to examine transcript levels and protein abundance of CuZnSOD/ CuZnSOD in the outer mantle and inner mantle in response to 3, 6 or 12 h of light exposure as compared with controls kept in darkness for 12 h. The hypothesis tested was that light exposure and/or the consequential hyperoxic stress would upregulate the expression levels of CuZnSOD/CuZnSOD in the outer mantle, but not the inner mantle, of T. squamosa.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Giant clams</head><p>Individuals of T. squamosa (521 ± 184 g, inclusive of shell valves; N = 16) were procured from Xanh Tuoi Tropical Fish Co. of Vietnam, and kept in three separate tanks. Each tank had a dimension of L90 cm x W62 cm x H60 cm and contained 335 L of recirculating seawater. The water conditions were as follows: temperature,~26°C; pH, 8.1-8.3; salinity, 30-32; hardness, 143-179 ppm; calcium, 380-420 ppm; total ammonia, 0-0.25 ppm; nitrate, 0 ppm; phosphate, 0-0.25 ppm. Each tank was illuminated with two sets of Aquazonic T5 lighting systems (Yi Hu Fish Farm Trading, Singapore), each containing four 40 W fluorescence tubes (90 cm; 2× Sun tubes and 2× Actinic blue tubes), from the top. The shaded light intensity (PPDF) measured in water at the level of the giant clams was 120 μmol photons m −2 s −1 (400-700 nm), which is equivalent to the intensity adopted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jantzen et al. (2008)</ref> for T. squamosa. Light intensity was measured by a Skye SKP 200 display meter connected with a SKP 215 PAR Quantum sensor (Skye Instruments Ltd., UK). Although it would be ideal to expose giant clams individually to the experimental conditions, individuals were sampled directly and randomly from the three glass tanks due to the limitation of re-circulating tanks available and the need to keep them in the exact conditions (including salinity, water quality, and light intensity). Research on giant clams was exempted from approval by the Nanyang Technological University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Experimental conditions and tissue sampling</head><p>Four individuals were sampled at the end of the 12 h dark period of the 12 h light:12 h dark regime (N = 4; control). Another twelve individuals were sampled at 3, 6, or 12 h after exposure to light (N = 4 for each time point). Parallel controls with individuals exposed to 24 h of darkness were avoided as it was important to simulate the normal dark/light hours experienced by the giant clams in their natural habitat. Giant clams were anaesthetized with 0.2% phenoxyethanol, and then forced open to cut the adductor before sampling the outer mantle, inner mantle, ctenidium, foot muscle, byssal retractor muscle, heart, hepatopancreas and kidney. Tissue samples were immediately freezeclamped in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analysis.</p></div>

PCR was performed using this pair of primers and DreamTaq™ polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) in a 9902 Veriti 96-well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to obtain a partial CuZnSOD sequence from the outer mantle of T. squamosa. The PCR cycling conditions were 94°C for 3 min, followed by 34 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min and 1 cycle of final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Thereafter, cloning experiments were performed as previously described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hiong et al., 2017a</ref>, which indicated the presence of only one major form of CuZnSOD fragments. The complete coding sequence of this major form of CuZnSOD was obtained by using a SMARTer RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA). The primers for 5′ and 3′ RACE were 5′-TCCCAGGTCACCAACA TGCCTAATTTCA-3′ and 5′-AGGCATGTTGGTGACCTGGGAAATGTG-3′, respectively.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) qPCR analysis was performed on samples obtained from the outer mantle and inner mantle. The reaction for each sample was conducted in triplicates using a StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with specific CuZnSOD qPCR primers designed according to the sequence obtained from T. squamosa (forward: 5′-CACTAACAGGA GCACATTCCA-3′; reverse: 5′-AATGCCAATCACACCACAC-3′). The amplification efficiency of the CuZnSOD primers was 99.8%.

Additionally, CuZnSOD of T. squamosa consisted of Cys58 and Cys147, which are known to form disulfide bonds that stabilize the entire structure. The two CuZnSOD signatures, namely FHVHQYGDN from positions 46 to 54 and GNAGGRLACG from positions 139 to 148, were mostly conserved in CuZnSOD of T. squamosa <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Although the extensible outer mantle of giant clams can be exposed directly and fully to light, symbiotic dinoflagellates residing therein are shaded by several layers of host cells and would therefore receive only a portion of the irradiance <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Holt et al., 2014)</ref>. In order to support photosynthesis in the symbionts, the outer mantle uniquely possesses iridocytes that forward-scatter light of appropriate wavelengths to them, but even then, only a small fraction (~5-10%) of the incident light would reach the symbionts present in the outer mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Holt et al., 2014)</ref>. Presumably, symbiotic dinoflagellates residing in tissues located inside the mantle cavity and lacking iridocytes would receive negligible irradiance. Yet, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Poo et al. (2020)</ref> have recently reported the presence of symbionts in four organs (inner mantle, ctenidium, hepatopancreas and foot muscle) of T. squamosa, which are devoid of iridocytes and do not have direct exposure to light. Particularly, symbiotic dinoflagellates are present at relatively high densities in specific regions of the inner mantle and the foot muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Poo et al., 2020)</ref>. In the inner mantle, a peculiar area adjacent to the hinge of the shell-valves contains substantial quantities of symbionts and is therefore brownish in color. Although the outer mantle of T. squamosa has the greatest phototrophic potential as reflected by its high transcript level of T. squamosa zooxanthellal form II ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (TSZrbcII), a moderate level of TSZrbcII transcripts is also detected in the inner mantle despite the lack of iridocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Poo et al., 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, the protein expression level of TSZRBCII in the outer mantle, but not that in the inner mantle, can be enhanced by illumination. Therefore, it can be concluded that the inner mantle has low phototrophic potential, and the symbionts residing therein may serve some non-phototrophic functions, like nitrogen metabolism including amino acid synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ip et al., 2020b)</ref>, to benefit the host. As a corollary, it can be postulated that the outer mantle, but not the inner mantle, would need to augment the defense against hyperoxia-related ROS caused by phototrophic activities in the symbionts during illumination. Indeed, results obtained from this study support such a postulate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Properties of the host CuZnSOD of T. squamosa</head><p>Based on sequence similarity and phenogramic analyses, it can be concluded that the sequence of CuZnSOD obtained from T. squamosa is derived from the host clam. In eukaryotes, CuZnSOD exists as homodimers, with each subunit having an active site for one Cu 2+ and one Zn 2+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Culotta et al., 2006)</ref>. Cu 2+ is the main catalytic ion in CuZnSOD which participates in the ping-pong redox mechanism with O 2 % - <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Valentine et al., 2005)</ref>, and is bound by the nitrogen atoms of four histidine residues, all of which have been conserved in the CuZnSOD of T. squamosa (His47, His49, His64 and His121; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Culotta et al., 2006)</ref>. Although Zn 2+ is not essential to the dismutation reaction catalyzed by CuZnSOD, its binding gives the enzyme extra thermal stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Furukawa et al., 2004)</ref>. The residues that aid in the association of Zn 2+ to CuZnSOD are also highly conserved (His64, His72, His81 and Asp84; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Culotta et al., 2006)</ref>. In addition, CuZnSOD of T. squamosa contains two conserved cysteine residues, Cys58 and Cys147, which are involved in the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sheng et al., 2014)</ref>. This disulfide bond stabilizes the Loop IV structure of CuZnSOD, which plays an important role in the dimerization of the enzyme <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Culotta et al., 2006)</ref>. The conserved Arg144 acts as a gatekeeping residue to the active site to regulate the access of O %to the metal binding sites, and has also been demonstrated to be a catalytically important residue <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sheng et al., 2014)</ref>. Overall, CuZnSOD of T. squamosa contains all the important residues for the catalytic activity and stability of the enzyme, as well as the two family signatures (FHVHQYGDN from positions 46 to 54 and GNAGGRLACG from positions 139 to 148) of CuZnSOD.</p><p>At first glance, the gene expression of CuZnSOD in various tissues/ organs of T. squamosa kept in darkness for 12 h (control) has no correlation with the density of the symbiotic dinoflagellates present, as the expression of CuZnSOD in the outer mantle was not substantially different from those in other organs. However, it would be important to elucidate whether the expression of CuZnSOD/CuZnSOD in the outer mantle could be enhanced by illumination, and whether the inner mantle would display a similar response to light.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Light exposure augments the protein abundance of CuZnSOD in the outer mantle</head><p>We report for the first time that there was a significant increase in the protein abundance of CuZnSOD in the outer mantle of T. squamosa after h of light exposure. It can be inferred that the increase had occurred between hour 6 and hour 12, because time was needed for the protein abundance of CuZnSOD to achieve a~2.3-fold increase from the control level. As light exposure had no significant effect on the transcript level of CuZnSOD in the outer mantle, the regulation of expression is apparently set at the translational level. Translational regulation would circumvent energetic requirements of transcriptional regulation related to synthesis, processing and exporting of mRNA, and allow for a faster response to external changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lackner and Bähler, 2008)</ref>. Furthermore, it is logical to deduce that the increase in protein abundance of CuZnSOD would result in a higher capacity to detoxify O 2 .</p><p>in the outer mantle of T. squamosa during illumination.</p><p>Light-driven energy transfer through electron transport is associated with ROS formation. Photosynthesis is a well-established source of ROS in phototrophic organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Foyer, 2018)</ref>, and photosynthesizing symbiotic dinoflagellates would increase ROS production during illumination. In giant clams, ROS generated by symbionts are unlikely to have a direct impact on the oxidative status of the host cells in the outer mantle because symbionts are located extracellularly inside the lumen of the tertiary zooxanthellal tubules. However, in light, photosynthesizing symbiotic dinoflagellates generate large amounts of O 2 and release it directly into the tubular fluid and hemolymph of the host. It is probable that O 2 diffuses across plasma membranes of host cells, and subsequently combines with the electrons that leak out from the host's mitochondrial electron transport chain to form O %within the cytoplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bandyopadhyay et al., 1999)</ref>. Therefore, the elevated levels of the host's CuZnSOD could function to mitigate oxidative damage by detoxifying O 2 %in the cytosol.</p><p>Recently, Hiong et al. (2018) have obtained the complete cDNA coding sequence of a host's MnSOD from the outer mantle of T. squamosa, and demonstrated that its gene and protein expression levels could also be upregulated during light exposure. In light, there could be increases in the metabolic rate and mitochondrial ROS production in host's cells of the outer mantle. This is because they need to increase the supply of nutrients to and the absorption of photosynthates from the symbionts. Hence, in the outer mantle of T. squamosa, transcript and protein expression levels of mitochondrial MnSOD/MnSOD need to be upregulated to detoxify excess mitochondrial O 2 %attributable to increases in the host's metabolic rate in order to prevent oxidative damage. As a fraction of CuZnSOD and its chaperone protein are known to be localized in the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Sturtz et al., 2001)</ref>, it could help to remove O 2 %that has leaked out of the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Finkel, 2011)</ref> and thus prevent the escape of mitochondrial ROS from the intermembrane space into the cytosol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The transcript and protein expression levels of CuZnSOD/CuZnSOD remain unchanged in the inner mantle during light exposure</head><p>The rate of shell formation in giant clams is known to be higher in light than in darkness <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rossbach et al., 2019)</ref>, and the inner mantle is involved directly in shell formation. In fact, it has been reported that the gene and/or protein expression levels of PMCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ip et al., 2018)</ref>, Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger 3 homolog <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Boo et al., 2019)</ref>, Na + /K + -ATPase αsubunit <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boo et al., 2018)</ref>, beta-Na + /H + exchanger homolog <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cao-Pham et al., 2019a)</ref>, carbonic anhydrase 4 homolog <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chew et al., 2019)</ref> and carbonic anhydrase 2 homolog <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ip et al., 2017b)</ref> are upregulated in the inner mantle of T. squamosa during illumination to enhance the transport of Ca 2+ , HCO 3</p><p>− and H + in support of light-enhanced shell formation. Therefore, it is logical to deduce that the metabolic rate of host cells in the inner mantle should be higher in light than in darkness. However, the transcript and protein expression levels of CuZnSOD/ CuZnSOD remained unchanged in the inner mantle of T. squamosa during 12 h of illumination. Notably, the major difference between the inner mantle and the outer mantle is that the former has many fewer symbiotic dinoflagellates, lower phototrophic potential and no iridophores as compared with the latter <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Poo et al., 2020)</ref>. Together, these results denote the increased expression of CuZnSOD/CuZnSOD in the outer mantle of T. squamosa during light exposure as a response to oxidative stresses related to photosynthetic activities of the symbionts and not simply to increases in the metabolic rate of the host clam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Unusual light-dependent expression of CuZnSOD in the outer mantle of T. squamosa</head><p>Plants possess photoreceptors and can therefore respond to light. They can also respond to light via signals generated by circadian rhythm or derived from the photosynthetic electron transport chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Pfannschmidt et al., 2001)</ref>. For instance, the transcript levels of genes related to photosynthesis display diurnal changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Harmer et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Blasing et al., 2005)</ref>. Particularly, the transcript levels of CuZnSOD increase in tomato <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Perl-Treves and Galun, 1991)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Arabidopsis (Kliebenstein et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Xing et al., 2013)</ref> during light exposure. By contrast, the transcript and protein expression levels of CuZnSOD/ CuZnSOD in non-symbiotic animal are not affected by illumination. Yet, light exposure led to a significant increase in the protein abundance of the host CuZnSOD in the outer mantle of T. squamosa. At present, it is uncertain whether such an increase in expression was resulted directly from light-responsive regulatory mechanisms of the host or from ROS produced by the host due to hyperoxia generated by the photosynthesizing symbiotic dinoflagellates during illumination.</p><p>Notably, T. squamosa possesses many host's enzymes and transporters that display light-enhanced gene and protein expression, and, unlike the host CuZnSOD, many of them are not known to respond to ROS and O 2 . Hence, it is probable that the host has developed a lightresponse signaling mechanism to coordinate the gene and protein expression levels of protein catalysts involved in a wide range of lightdependent physiological processes. These light-enhanced processes include shell formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ip et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ip et al., , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boo et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boo et al., , 2019</ref>, H + excretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Ip et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hiong et al., 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Ip et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cao-Pham et al., 2019a)</ref>, Ca 2+ absorption (Cao-Pham et al., 2019b), inorganic carbon absorption and transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Ip et al., 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Koh et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chew et al., 2019)</ref>, ammonia absorption and assimilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hiong et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Boo et al., 2018)</ref>, and absorption of urea <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chan et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chan et al., , 2019</ref>, nitrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ip et al., 2020a)</ref>, phosphate <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chan et al., 2020)</ref> as well as glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chan et al., 2019)</ref>. Therefore, it is also possible that the antioxidative defense enzymes <ref type="bibr">(MnSOD, Hiong et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> CuZnSOD, this study) of T. squamosa are also regulated by the same host-mediated light-responsive signaling mechanism. After all, the host clam must possess light-responsive processes; only then, will it be able to support and complement, as well as to ameliorate the oxidative stress arising from, the light-dependent photosynthetic activity in its symbionts residing in the outer mantle. The oxidative stress hypothesis of aging states that organismal aging occurs because of accumulative oxidative damage of important cellular macromolecules and organelles caused by ROS generated from aerobic respiration <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Harman, 1972)</ref>. Nonetheless, despite living in symbiosis with phototrophic dinoflagellates that generate O 2 inside their bodies, giant clams have exceptional longevity. For instance, the smooth giant clam, Tridacna derasa, has a maximum lifespan of &gt; 100 years, while the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians, can live only up to 2 years. Yet, the basal anti-oxidative capacity together with the activities of SODs and catalase in T. derasa are comparable to those in A. irradians <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ungvari et al., 2012)</ref>. Hence, as demonstrated by CuZnSOD (this study) and MnSOD <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hiong et al., 2018)</ref> of T. squamosa, the key factor to the extraordinary success of giant clams in detoxifying ROS may lie in the novel light-inducible nature of their anti-oxidative enzymes rather than the constant expression of these enzymes at elevated levels under all conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Perspective</head><p>Various environmental perturbations and stressors, particularly high temperature and high irradiance, can generate a stress response called 'bleaching' in symbiotic reef organisms. Bleaching eventually results in the loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates and/or their  photosynthetic pigments from the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Glynn and D'croz, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lesser et al., 1990)</ref>. In scleractinian corals, the detrimental bleaching process is attributable to the overproduction of ROS by symbiotic dinoflagellates generated by their damaged photosynthetic apparatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Lesser, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Downs et al., 2002)</ref>, although there is evidence against such a proposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Nielsen et al., 2018)</ref>. Notably, coral bleaching can occur in the absence of light, suggesting that damage to photosynthetic machinery may not be necessarily involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Tolleter et al., 2013)</ref>. As symbionts are located intracellularly inside symbiosomes in scleractinian corals, the leakage of ROS from the intracellular symbionts could overwhelm the host's oxidative defense system and cause direct damage to the coral cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Lesser et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Downs et al., 2002)</ref>. Bleaching can also occur in giant clams under certain environmental conditions, leading to a reduction in the population of symbiotic dinoflagellates and discoloration of the outer mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Addessi, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Leggat et al., 2003)</ref>. However, unlike scleractinian corals, giant clams harbor symbiotic dinoflagellates extracellularly inside a tubular system, and these symbionts are surrounded by the tubular fluid. Therefore, the oxidative theory of coral bleaching may not be directly relevant to the bleaching process in giant clams. Results from this study revealed that the light-enhanced expression of CuZnSOD/CuZnSOD in the outer mantle of T. squamosa could be a host's response to ameliorate hyperoxic oxidative stress related to photosynthesis in the symbionts. However, the possibility of T. squamosa being able to change the expression levels of CuZnSOD/CuZnSOD, and perhaps also those of other antioxidative enzymes, in response to high environmental temperature and/or high irradiance cannot be ignored. Hence, efforts should be made in the future to examine the effects of environmental stressors on the host's oxidative defense mechanisms in T. squamosa in order to evaluate whether they play a role in the bleaching process in giant clams. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A multiple amino acid sequence alignment of Copper-zinc Superoxide Dismutase (CuZnSOD) of Tridacna squamosa with CuZnSOD sequences from Perna indica (Indian brown mussel), Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Homo sapiens (human).

				<p>Ž. Adult yellow stingrays Urolophus jamaicensis , collected off the southeast Florida coast, were maintained in filtered Ž. and re-circulated synthetic sea water 33‰ for 5᎐13 days at 30ЊC. Animals exposed to 82%, 74% and 66% SW in gradual steps exhibited rapid and significant weight gains followed by recovery to pre-dilution levels in 2᎐6 days. w Ž. Ž. Ž. Ž .x Ž. Acclimated animals at each salinity 100% N s 12 , 82% 7 , 74% 4 and 66% SW 3 were anesthetized MS222 and bled from the caudal vein. In 100% SW, stingray plasma was slightly hypo-osmotic to the external medium. Plasma w x osmolality decreased with stepwise dilutions, but became increasingly hyperosmotic to the bathing media. Plasma Na w x w x and Cl each decreased by approximately 13%, 23% and 16%, respectively, in 82%, 74% and 66% SW. Plasma urea w x w x w x decreased by 21%, 25% and 59%, respectively. Changes in plasma K and Ca were minor. Mean corpuscular Hb measurements suggest that stingray red cells swelled less at each dilution than predicted for a passive erythrocyte w x osmometer. RBC K decreased by 12%, 36% and 29%, respectively, in 82%, 74% and 66% SW. Quantitatively, the Ž. other measured electrolytes Cl, Na and Ca changed by lesser amounts. Results suggest that for mild and moderate Ž. dilutions 82% and 74% SW , yellow stingrays release both ions and urea from intracellular and extracellular Ž. compartments. With further dilution 66% SW , the elasmobranchs retain electrolytes at the expense of urea.</p>

Prior to shipment to Chicago IL , the animals were maintained in sheltered fiber glass aquaria supplied with a constant flow of fresh sea water at ambient temperature at the Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Ž . Center. Thirteen de-barbed stingrays 168᎐619 g were packaged in waterproof containers filled with Ž . oxygenated 100% O sea water and transported 2 to DePaul University by air courier.</p><p>In the laboratory, animals were housed in three Ž . glass tanks 151 and 208 l supplied with aerated, re-circulating synthetic sea water. Water quality was maintained by continuous re-circulation through an external biological and mechanical Ž . filtration system. The salinity 33‰ and temper-Ž . ature 30ЊC of the laboratory water were similar to those of the stingrays' natural environment. The elasmobranchs were fed frozen shrimp during initial captivity in Florida; in the laboratory at DePaul University, the stingrays were maintained in an unfed state. All animals were assumed to be sexually mature based on the morphometric crite-Ž . ria of Martin and Cailliet 1988 .</p></div>

Like the yellow stingray, these latter fish also experienced significant reductions in plasma osmolality, while maintaining increasing osmotic gradients between plasma and external media during environmental dilution. These findings suggest a common strategy of osmoregulation among euryhaline elasmobranchs.</p><p>The measured plasma solutes also exhibited significant dilution-induced changes in concentra-Ž . tion <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> , consistent with the corresponding osmolality values. However, the relative variations in plasma solutes were generally disproportionate; hence, regulation of the individual plasma solutes seems likely. If the observed changes in solute concentration had simply been a function of environmental dilution, then all solutes would have been altered by comparable amounts. All Ž measured plasma solutes, with one exception Ca . in 66% SW , exhibited concentration reductions for stingrays acclimated to the sea water dilutions Ž . <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> . Whether most elasmobranchs that migrate into dilute environments regulate their plasma solutes individually remains largely untested. However, the data presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> suggest that this type of adjustment does occur in Ž some euryhaline species <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Goldstein et al., 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Goldstein and Forster, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">De Vlaming and .

Therefore, within the salinity range that this animal Ž normally inhabits 81᎐ 100% SW; Yanez-. Arancibia, 1979 , the yellow stingray regulates its extracellular fluid concentration in hypo-osmotic environments through comparable reductions of each of the three major plasma solutes. In the Ž . most dilute medium 66% SW , further losses of the two primary electrolytes were curtailed. In fact, plasma concentrations of Na and Cl were reduced only 17% and 15%, respectively, below control levels. The animal's lower limit of tolerance for extracellular ionic dilution may occur within this concentration range. Solute compensation for the transition from 74% to 66% SW was, therefore, achieved largely by further and substantial reductions of extracellular urea. In 66% w x SW, the plasma urea of acclimated stingrays was reduced by 59% below control levels. Similar findings have been reported for other dilutiontolerant sharks and rays. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> shows that for several marine elasmobranchs acclimated in media ranging from 77% to 26% SW, the measured w x declines in plasma urea were greater, and in some cases two times greater, than those exhibw x w x ited by Na andror Cl .</p><p>w x w x The small changes in plasma K and Ca suggest that neither cation makes a quantitative contribution to extracellular osmoregulation associ-Ž . ated with environmental dilution <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> . These observations may reflect the significant roles played by potassium and calcium in transmembrane gradients, secondary messenger reactions, and nerve and muscle function, and thus the necessity for their tighter regulation than for other extracellular solutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Intracellular solute regulation</head><p>Ž The three measured RBC cations K, Na and . Ca exhibited similar responses to environmental Ž . dilution <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> ; however, only potassium made a significant quantitative contribution to the change in ionic concentration. The three cations were reduced by 12᎐16% in 82% SW and 32᎐37% in 74% SW, while in 66% SW, the electrolytes revealed a leveling off effect which may reflect the animal's lower limit of tolerance for intracellular ionic concentration. These trends are similar Ž . to those reported for plasma Na and Cl <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> . Chloride, the only measured RBC anion, was maintained at a high and constant concentration for the four salinity conditions. A similar rew x sponse in RBC Cl was exhibited by the Port Ž . Jackson shark H. portusjacksoni upon acclima-Ž . tion to 50% SW <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cooper and Morris, 1998</ref> . Ž . Robertson 1989 reported high concentrations of inorganic phosphate anion in muscle of spotted Ž . dogfish S. canicula . This latter electrolyte might serve an important role in intraerythrocytic solute regulation in U. jamaicensis. Furthermore, the increased RBC volume associated with environmental dilution reduced the effective concentra-Ž tion of impermeant polyanionic species e.g. pro-. teins and organic phosphates .</p><p>Intracellular concentrations of urea were not reported for the yellow stingray. However, the literature provides considerable support for the uniform distribution of urea across the RBC Ž . membrane of elasmobranchs see Section 4.1 . w x We suggest, therefore, that the urea for erythrocytes and plasma in U. jamaicensis were nearly identical and exhibited comparable declines with Ž . Ž environmental dilution <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Walsh et al., . 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Carlson and Goldstein, 1997</ref> . We further w x predict that the stingray RBC urea experienced a substantial reduction associated with the 74% to 66% SW transition, while the measured electrolytes remained largely unchanged.</p><p>We conclude that when exposed to mild or Ž . moderate dilutions 82% and 74% SW , yellow stingrays regulated their body fluid compartments slightly hyperosmotic to the external milieu by comparable reductions of the major electrolytes Ž . and urea. With greater dilution 66% SW , these elasmobranchs maintained their hyperosmotic state by eliminating additional urea, while resisting further reductions of electrolytes. The evolutionary strategy for this may be related to the energetics of osmoregulation. With substantial environmental dilution, the metabolic costs of ultimately replacing lost urea may be off-set by the reductions in solute gradients between the plasma and external medium for the electrolytes as well as urea.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Effects of environmental dilution from 100% to 82% SW on the body weight of six adult stingrays as a function of time.

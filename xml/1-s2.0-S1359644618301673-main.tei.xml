			<abstract>
				<p>Cnidaria provide the largest source of bioactive peptides for new drug development. The venoms contain enzymes, potent pore-forming toxins and neurotoxins. The neurotoxins can immobilize predators rapidly when discharged via modifying sodium-channel-gating or blocking the potassium channel during the repolarization stage. Most cnidarian neurotoxins remain conserved under the strong influence of negative selection. Neuroactive peptides targeting the central nervous system through affinity with ion channels could provide insight leading to drug treatment of neurological diseases, which arise from ion channel dysfunctions. Although marine resources offer thousands of possible peptides, only one peptide derived from Cnidaria: ShK-186, also named dalazatide, has reached the pharmaceutical market. This review focuses on neuroprotective agents derived from cnidarian neurotoxic peptides.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Venoms are complex cocktails involving a range of molecules, such as large proteins, small peptides, polyamines and salts, that disrupt the physiology of prey animals upon injection <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Venom peptides and proteins have been honed by millions of years of evolutionary pressure to bind their receptors with high affinity, and in many cases exceptional selectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Most of the current venom-peptide-derived drugs were studied in several venomous lineages that are relatively younger in evolutionary origin, such as snake venoms, which evolved to target either the neuromuscular system or cardiovascular system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. By striking contrast, most peptides in cone-snail and arachnid venoms target the nervous system and aim to induce rapid immobilization of prey. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses have identified that spider and cone-snail venoms comprise &gt;1000 distinct peptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, whereas scorpion venoms often contain as many as several hundred components <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Only one extant venom-derived drug: Prialt 1 , has a nervous system target, whereas many of the venom-derived compounds are currently under development to target enzymes, ion channels, receptors or transporters in the central or peripheral nervous system (e.g., ACV-1, CGX-1007, CGX-1160, CNSB004, RPI-78M, RPI-MN, ShK-186, THA 901 and Xen2174) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In the phylum Cnidaria (sea anemones, corals, jellyfish and hydra) all members are venomous <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. It is typified by the unique venom delivery characteristic known as nematocyst, employed to inject a cocktail of toxins into animals for predation and defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Nematocysts are mostly located on tentacles, which also exist on the surface of the bell, oral arms and the stomach in certain species of jellyfish <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The morphological properties of nematocysts are abundant and correlate to body size, specific ecosystems, prey size and selectivity in prey capture <ref type="bibr">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. The capsule venom is located on the inner surface of the inverted tubule which everts outside during discharging then exposes and injects into the prey <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The mechanism of nematocyst discharge in response to external stimuli is generally accepted that the high osmotic pressure exceeds a critical threshold at the end of capsule morphogenesis then triggers the venom discharge <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Cnidarian peptide toxins could be classified as enzymes like phospholipase A2 and metalloproteases, pore-forming toxins, including actinoporins and perforin, and neurotoxins including NaTxs, KTxs, Kunitz peptides, SCRiPs, acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) inhibitors and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) inhibitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. As such, owing to the increasing scientific interest in the discovery and characterization of novel toxins or toxin families, several recent studies were carried out, using genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic approaches, on the cnidarian venom from hydra <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, sea anemone <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, box jellyfish <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, cannonball jellyfish <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, ghost jellyfish <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, sea nettle <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, stony coral <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> and zoanthid coral <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>According to the classification proposed in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), class Anthozoa currently includes ten orders and 6989 valid species, occupying about two-thirds of all known cnidarian species. Besides, this class comprises 99% of new marine nature products recorded from Cnidaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Within Anthozoa, the orders Alcyonacea and Gorgonacea are the ones that contributed with the highest number of promising bioactive marine compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. These compounds include disterpenes, sesquiterpenes, furanoditerpenes, terpenoids, capnellenes and steroids with HIV-inhibitory <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, cytotoxic <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, anti-inflammatory <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, anticancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> and antimicrobial activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The diversity of cnidarian venom components ranges from small molecules (e.g., purines, biogenic amines) to peptides or proteins that evolved over the course of hundreds of millions of years <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Interestingly, some toxin types identified previously in other venomous animals comprise similar cnidarian venom arsenals. The most striking example is Kunitz peptides, which are expressed in sea anemones, cone snails, insects, scorpions, spiders, reptiles, ticks and vampire bats <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. A novel Kunitz neurotoxin from zoanthid coral Palythoa caribaeorum has also been proposed that could have potential for the development of neuroprotective agents through K V 1.3 blockade <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. However, to date, the evolution, diversification and peptide toxin composition of ancient venom systems, like those of cnidarians, remain understudied. Another example of convergent expression of toxins is afforded by the peptide blockade with potassium channel K V 1, like BgK, ShK and HsTx1, which evolved convergently in sea anemones and scorpions -species that even use the same residues for blocking the channel pores <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. The neurotoxins from Cnidaria could disrupt ion conductance through modification or blockage of the voltage-gated sodium (Na V ) and potassium (K V ) ion channels. There are 110 peptide or protein toxins isolated from 45 sea anemone species that were manually curated from the Tox-Prot database that could act on ion channels. Three toxin families act on ion channels including sea anemone sodium channel inhibitory toxin family (52 proteins), sea anemone type 3 (BDS) potassium channel toxin family (32 proteins) and sea anemone type 2 potassium channel toxin subfamily (26 proteins) are most common <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Briefly, sodium channel toxins (NaTxs) are some of the best characterized cnidarian toxins and are classified into three types based on the cysteine arrangement, amino acid composition and immunological cross reactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Another type of neurotoxin is potassium ion channel toxin (KTx), which has been classified into five types based on physiological homologs and biochemical characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Recently, a novel peptide neurotoxin that consisted of two cysteine residues forming one disulfide bond decreased sodium (Na V 1.7) and potassium (K V 1.4) currents and was isolated from Palythoa caribaeorum <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. Using next-generation sequencing, some novel peptide neurotoxins were identified from zoanthid coral transcriptome in our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>.</p><p>Neurotoxic peptides have attracted growing interest in drug development for neurological disorder treatment owing to their high affinity to receptors, ionic channels and transporters in the CNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. They can present with either analgesic, anxiolytic, antiepileptic or neuroprotective effects, acting as inhibitors or stimulants in specific structures, such as ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors and transporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. In this review, peptide neurotoxins, particularly those acting on the nervous system through their impact on ion channels, are discussed. Also, we provide insight into the characterization of neuroactive peptide sequences in Cnidaria having potential neurotoxic activity, which will serve to inform the development of drugs for the investigation and prospective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases arising from ion-channel dysfunctions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of cnidarian venom in drug discovery</head><p>Cnidarian stings can cause minor local irritation, and even systemic reactions including excruciating pain and life-threatening cardiovascular collapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>, owing to their interaction with ion channels in the CNS and transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. Cnidarian venom can affect ion conductance of the plasma membrane of target cells by altering the activity of resident ion channels or forming new ion permeation pathways following direct insertion of pore-forming proteins in the lipid bilayer <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. These properties mean that cnidarian peptide toxins could contribute to the development of compounds for the treatment of pain and neurodegenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. Ion channels are attractive targets for human disease treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. The venoms of Cnidaria could act with high potency and selectivity at K V , Ca V and Na V ion channels, taking advantage of the neuronal effects of channel modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Importantly, it is believed that venom-derived peptides will make the transition to drugs targeting voltage-gated potassium channels in future <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>.</p><p>Peptide toxins (molecular weight &lt;10 kDa) contained in venoms are of great interest as a source of drug leads because of their high potency and selectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Most venom peptides have cysteine-rich architectures that lead to extreme stability in the gastrointestinal tract for sufficient residence and potent resistance to proteases <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Most of the known cnidarian peptide toxins belong to class Anthozoa. To date, 200 proteinaceous (proteins and peptides) toxins have been identified among sea anemones <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. In general, peptide toxins from sea anemones can be classified into three major groups: phospholipase A2, cytolysins and neurotoxins <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. The neurotoxins include cysteine-rich peptides distributed across eight unique structural scaffolds, mainly voltage-gated sodium-channel toxins and voltage-gated potassium toxins, as mentioned above.</p><p>One of the most famous peptide toxins from phylum Cnidaria is Stichodactyla (ShK) toxin, a potassium-channel inhibitor, which was first discovered in the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79]</ref>. ShK toxin can induce antiobesity activity and reduce insulin resistance through blockade of K V 1.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>. Blockers of K V 1.3 channels in lymphocytes preferentially inhibit the activation of these cells and therefore show considerable potential as therapeutics for autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Thus, most studies on the development of ShK toxin analogs as therapeutic agents focus on targeting K V 1.3 ion channels in autoimmune processes and diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. There are several ShK derivatives that have been developed to improve their selectivity to K V 1.3. Briefly, ShK-Dap22 could possess a highly selective and potent T lymphocyte channel-blocking effect, when the Lys22 of ShK was replaced by diaminopropionic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>. ShK-170, also named ShK-L5, containing an N-terminal phosphotyrosine extension, is a potent and selective blocker. Notably, it can prevent neurotoxicity by radiation-activated microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Peng et al. proved that ShK-170 suppressed radiation-induced production of the proinflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-6, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a by microglia. Moreover, ShK-170 inhibited neurotoxicity mediated by radiation-activated microglia and promoted neurogenesis by increasing the proliferation of neural progenitor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. However, it showed minor pH-related hydrolysis and oxidation byproducts that were exacerbated by increasing temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Dalazatide, previously referred to as ShK-186, is currently in Phase Ib clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. The Phase Ib clinical trial proved dalazatide treatment was well tolerated without serious adverse events; and is the first K V 1.3 inhibitor to be tested in an autoimmune disease clinical trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. However, there are new peptides identified in anemone transcriptomes that contain a ShKT domain and are structural homologs of ShK and BgK but not active against K V 1 channels. Recently, a peptide AsK132958 from Anemonia sulcate, with an ShKT cysteine framework and similar disulfide connectivities and structural scaffold to ShK, showed no activity against any of the K V channels tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phylogeny and evolution of cnidarian peptide neurotoxins</head><p>Neurotoxins play an extremely important part in the venoms of cnidarians, to rapidly immobilize prey animals by disrupting ion conductance through the modification or blocking of ion channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. Neurotoxins in Cnidaria have been characterized at the protein level only within Anthozoan, and most of them were characterized from sea anemones <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>. In sea anemone, the sodium-channel toxins are better defined within the cnidarian toxin groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. It was found that the cysteine arrangement for the 3D structure in type III potassium-channel toxins share a strong resemblance to that in sodium-channel toxins <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. However, evidence shows that sodium-channel toxin and type III potassium-channel toxin are specific to their respective ion-channel targets. Many type III potassium-channel toxins appeared to act on various ion channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. For example, the peptide BDS-I could modify K V 3-family subunits and Na V 1.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref>. In addition, a neurotoxin, AdE-1, which was identified in Aiptasia diaphana, could be active on K V and Na V channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref>. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction for neurotoxin genes in sea anemone concluded that a similar cysteine framework between sodium-channel toxins and type III potassium-channel toxins resulted from their shared ancestry, which was clarified as the first example of neofunctionalization once the gene duplication event was initiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Collectively, molecular evolutionary assessments of cnidarian toxin families indicated most cnidarian neurotoxins evolve under strong influence of negative selection whereas only type III potassium-channel toxins seem to evolve rapidly under positive Darwinian selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Cnidarian neurotoxins can affect ion channels <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Voltage-gated sodium channel toxins</head><p>Na V channel transmembrane complexes comprise a pore-forming a subunit (a single polypeptide chain that folds to form four homologous repeats, named domain I to IV) and an auxiliary b subunit that facilitate membrane localization and modulate channel properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. The first Cnidaria toxin, also the first NaTx, is ATX II, suggesting that the positive inotropic effects of ATX II and increased stimulation frequency could be induced by a similar mechanism in guinea pig papillary muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. It has been suggested that NaTxs have evolved under the influence of negative selection by computing omega values for each clade independently <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. This finding suggested that favoring the conservation of structurally important and catalytic residues owing to filtering out mutations leads to loss of stable structure and function, because synthesis and secretion of proteins is an energetically expensive process <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Anthozoan NaTxs, and several other groups of toxins from scorpions and spiders, bind to loop S3-S4 in domain IV of Na V channels, locking the S4 segment in its inward position and thus inhibiting conformational changes for channel fast inactivation, resulting in neurotransmitter release in synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. The NaTxs were classified into four groups: type I NaTx; type II NaTx (consists of 46-49 residues crosslinked by three disulfide bridges, except for AeI from Actinia equina that is 54 amino acids long); type III (which contains 27-32 residues and can have three or four disulfide bridges); and type IV (which is represented by calitoxins I and II, which are isolated from Calliactis parasitica, and contains 46 amino acids and three disulfide bonds) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">96]</ref>. Furthermore, there are peptides as short as 30 amino acids in length in the sea anemone that showed similar activity against NaTxs, even though they lack shared motifs <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Lastly, a novel neurotoxin forming only one disulfide bond was isolated and characterized and could target Na V and K V ; it does not resemble any previously reported toxin <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p></div>

In a rat model of postoperative pain, peripheral ASICs formed depolarizing channels that could be activated by extracellular protons <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>. There are now ten ASIC modulators that have been described in animal venoms, whereas the modulators from sea anemone preferentially target ASIC3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[109]</ref>. APETx2 was a 42residue peptide isolated from Anthopleura elegantissima, and was the first potent and ASIC3-selective inhibitor discovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. The use of APETx2 in vivo has been key in establishing the role of ASIC3 as a sensor of acid-induced and postoperative pain, also demonstrating its involvement in inflammatory pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">111]</ref>. It has been reported that APETx2 was analgesic in rat models of inflammatory and osteoarthritic pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref>. Recently, several other peptide toxins targeting ASICs were isolated from different sea anemones. Hcr 1b-1, an analog of APETx2 with 51% identity, was isolated from Heteractis crispa <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[113]</ref>. Although it was 35-fold less potent than APETx2, it shares identity with much of the APETx2 pharmacophore for ASIC3, indicating less of an off-target effect. A recent review summarized that APETx2 could act on hASIC3 with an IC 50 value of 175 nM and hetero ASIC3/1b with IC 50 value of 900 nM. Meanwhile, Hcr 1b-1 was more selective although less potent than APETx2 against hASIC3 with an IC 50 value of 5.5 mM <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>. Ugr 9-1 was isolated from Urticina grebelnyi, which completely blocked transient hASIC3 current but was inactive against ASIC1a, ASIC1b and ASIC2a, potentially making it a more selective ASIC3 inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. Another ASIC toxin is PhcrTx1, which was the first ICK peptide isolated from Phymanthus crucifer. This inhibits the ASIC currents in rat sensory neurons and produces a moderate but significant K V current blockade effect, with no activity on Na V <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[115]</ref>. ASICs are sensors of acid-induced and postoperative pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[108]</ref>, so Cnidaria venom peptides acting as ASIC inhibitors could be therapeutic lead candidates developed for pain treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[114]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRPV1 inhibitors</head><p>TRPV1 is a nonselective cationic ion channel primarily expressed in nociceptors, and can be activated by capsaicin, noxious heat, protons, lipid messengers and exogenous ligands <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[118]</ref>.

The toxins APHC1-3, which are derived from the sea anemone Heteractis crispa, were the first peptides to inhibit TRPV1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[123]</ref>. Functionally, <ref type="bibr">APHC3</ref> was the most potent by inhibiting 71% of 3 mM capsaicin with the lowest IC 50 value of 18 nM <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>. In vivo tests suggest APHC1 and APHC3 could produce a dose-dependent inhibition of thermal nociception in pain models without causing hyperthermia <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>. Interestingly, APHC1 was a more potent TRPV1 inhibitor than APHC3 and it was effective in increasing paw withdrawal latency from a hot plate at doses as low as 0.01 mg/kg, whereas minimum effective dose of APHC3 was 0.05 mg/kg <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>. Introduction of TRPV1 antagonists to the clinic as new analgesics was slow because of the adverse effects like hyperthermia and insensitivity-causing scalding heat <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">127]</ref>. Thus, APHC1 provided an interesting insight into the possible effects of partially inhibiting TRPV1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>.</p></div>

The cnidarian neurotoxins prolong the action potential of the excitable and nonexcitable membranes in sensory neurons and cardiac and skeletal muscle cells by modifying the ion channels (e.g., pore-blocking toxins bind to the outer vestibule or ion conduction pore; and gating-modifier toxins alter channel conformation during opening or inactivation) during the repolarization stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[130]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[131]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[132]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The association between ion channel inhibition and neuroprotective effects</head><p>Neurotoxins are biomolecules that exert a lethal effect in the nanogram dose range or lower, by targeting the nervous system with affinity to Na V or K V channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">139]</ref>. Growing evidence suggests that ion channels could be promising targets for neurodegenerative disease therapeutics <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">141]</ref>. Na V channels are thought to have an important role in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>. In the CNS, factors such as nitric oxide, inflammation-induced ischemia and mitochondria impairment reduce energy production, leading to decreasing Na + / K + -ATPase pump activity, membrane depolarization and abnormal persistent accumulation of Na + influx. Intracellular Na + overload drives the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger to import Ca 2+ into axons, triggering a pathogenic loop that causes further mitochondrial damage and activation of a harmful cocktail of pro-teases, lipases and nitric oxide synthase, finally causing neuron injury and neuronal loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>. Thus, blockade against Na V channels might ameliorate neurodegenerative disorders through inhibition of Na + overload <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[142]</ref>. K V channels are key regulators of excitability in neurons and nonexcitable tissues such as microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref>. Microglia are the key inflammatory cells in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which could be activated by amyloid-b (Ab) producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to AD pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>. It was demonstrated that microglia priming and ROS production were abolished by 5-iodoresiniferatoxin and charybdotoxin, which are TRPV1 and K V 1.3 inhibitors, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>. In addition, it was reported that K Ca 3.1 was upregulated in reactive astrocytes of Tg APP/PS1 mice and AD patients compared with wild-type mice and control humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref>. Moreover, K Ca 3.1 blockade inhibited astrocyte activation and reduced brain levels of IL-1b, TNF-a, iNOS and COX-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">[149]</ref>.</p><p>ASICs have vital roles in many physiological processes including sodium homeostasis, synaptic plasticity, sensory transduction and neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">[150]</ref>. ASIC1 is the predominant ASIC expressed in the CNS and is believed to contribute to apoptosis under pathological conditions owing to a robust increase of Ca 2+ influx and acidic environment (pH 6.5) in cerebral tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>. The overexpression of ASIC1a was found in dopaminergic neurons of Parkinson's disease patients and rodent models <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref>.</p><p>Again, ion channels such as Na V , K V , and ASIC could be targets of neurodegenerative diseases. There are peptide neurotoxins isolated from terrestrial animals displaying neuroprotective activities. Chassagnon et al. reported that Hi1a, a peptide isolated from tarantula Psalmopoeus cambridgei, which was homologous to psalmotoxin, an ASIC1a inhibitor, could inhibit ASIC1a activation in a pH-independent and slowly reversible manner, resulting in a marked reduction of infract size as well as amelioration of neurological and motor function in a focal model of ischemic stroke in rat <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153]</ref>. However, the use of marine natural products to treat neurodegenerative diseases is largely underexploited and only a few studies reported that compounds originated from marine neuronal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">[154,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">155]</ref>. As summarized above, Cnidaria neurotoxic peptides could be a rich resource of various ion-channel blockers, providing drug development insights for therapeutics that target ion channels to treat neurodegenerative diseases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks</head><p>Marine bioprospecting holds significant potential for the discovery of novel drugs, nutritional supplements and industrial biotechnology applications. Members of the phylum Cnidaria, including sea anemones, corals, jellyfish and hydra, are venomous Eumetazoan. High-throughput methods combining transcriptomic and proteomic profiling could yield a holistic overview of the complexities of the venom from Cnidaria, revealing many uncharacterized peptides. Many cnidarian toxins remain to be discovered and their potential as novel sources of therapeutic substances should be investigated. Neuroactive peptides targeting the CNS through their affinity with ion channels could provide an insightful perspective to characterize drug leads for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases or epilepsy, which arise from ionchannel dysfunction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Ion channels affected by cnidarian neurotoxic peptides.

Medicines and nature have been strictly linked through the utilization of traditional medicines as therapeutic agents for thousands of years. Plenty of studies were performed on traditional medicines, which were primarily plants, constituting the basis of most early medicines (such as aspirin, digitoxin, morphine, quinine, etc.) and providing a pivotal role in today's drug discovery [1] . Even today, natural metabolites play a crucial role as one of the major sources of novel medicines due to their incomparable structural diversity, relatively small dimensions (<2000 Da), and their drug-like properties (absorption and metabolism) as well [2] .",

The variance of marine environments, sea, and oceans offer a limitless biodiversity in compounds obtained from marine species. In order to survive in extreme habitats, they have developed particular secondary metabolic pathways to produce molecules to accommodate their lifestyles. For example, despite the unusual environmental conditions (light and oxygen exposure) that might lead oxidative damage, marine organisms do not undergo any serious photodynamic damage. Hence, it is known that marine organisms are able to synthesize molecules with bioactivity, especially antioxidant molecules, to protect themselves from external factors, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, stress, and herbivores [3, 4] . Marine organisms attracted the interest of scientists due to the substantial bioactivities of their extracts and isolates. In this purpose, a number of metabolites of a wide variety of chemical classes, including terpenes, shikimates, polyketides, acetogenins, peptides, alkaloids, and many unidentified and uncharacterized structures, were purified from marine bio resources and exhibited several utilizations as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals [2] . Those compounds have various pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, antibacterial, antitumor, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, anticoagulant [4] . Amongst them carotenoids have become the topic of great interest for pharmaceutical industry; thus, they have significant antioxidant activities and anticancer activities [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

They are in the structure of tetraterpene and capable of absorbing light primarily between 400 nm and 500 nm. They are encountered in macroalgae, bacteria, and unicellular phytoplanktons and perform diverse and notable functions such as protecting chlorophyll via absorbing light energy and transferring it to chlorophyll and scavenging free radicals of oxygen [9] . Animals are not capable of synthesizing carotenoids de novo since they need to ingest carotenoids via supplementation or in food. Aquatic animals ingest carotenoids from foods, such as algae and other animals, and convert their structure via metabolic reactions leading structural diversity. To date, more than 850 carotenoids were detected in nature, including up to 100 that are present in the food chain and human nutrition, and more than 250 are of marine origin [10] [11] [12] . The importance of carotenoids is due to their functional properties, not only as natural antioxidants and color enhancing agents in the food industry, but also as pharmaceuticals and as chemotaxonomic markers [8] . Carotenoids play significant role in eye, bone, and cardiovascular health; they are used in cancer prevention, to boost immune function and cognitive performance, as infant nutrition, and antioxidant, antitumour, antiaging, and anti-inflammatory agents. Carotenoids exert their activities via different mechanisms. For example, \u03b1-carotene and \u03b2-carotene are converted to vitamin A in the human body, and show its activity, lutein, and zeaxanthin protect human eye by absorbing blue and near UV light [8, 9, 11] . However, technically, the reason behind the other activities of carotenoids is thought to be due to their significant antioxidant activity.",

Under physiological conditions, ROS are repeatedly generated and eliminated through ROS scavenging systems in order to maintain redox homeostasis. Change in redox balance leads altered ROS production, resulting in cell damage, aberrant cell signaling; thus, disruption of cell homeostasis [13] . ROS are extremely hazardous for living organisms, causing detrimental diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes. ROS involve in carcinogenesis through inducing persistent DNA injuries and mutations in p53, the tumor suppressor gene, genomic instability, and aberrant pro-tumorigenic signaling; thus, they might be considered as oncogenic. Thus, prevention of ROS production and balancing antioxidant system is thought to inhibit cancer development. On the contrary, many chemotherapeutic agents in cancer therapy, as well as ionizing radiation, function by promoting ROS production and promoting apoptosis and necrosis of the cells. For instance, some molecules, such as paclitaxel, are able to attack cancer cells via inducing ROS generation or interfering ROS metabolism [14] . Since high levels of ROS are also toxic to cancer cells and potentially induce cell death [13, 14] .

Carotenoids are not only essential antioxidants, they are also crucial anticancer agents. They exert their anticancer activity via promoting gap junctional communication. Carotenoids initiate cell proliferation and differentiation by binding and regulating the receptors (retinoid acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR)). Although they have significant pharmacological activities, there are several limitations of carotenoids, such as low solubility in water, easy degradation, low shelf life, and unfavorable pH in digestive tract leading to alleviated bioavailability. To overcome these undesirable properties, various encapsulation methods are preferred for carotenoids [9] . In this paper, chemical structures, sources, bioavailability, and activities of carotenoids from marine organisms are overviewed.",

Their carotenoids accumulation can be due to their essential metabolism for survival (primary carotenoids) or precise ecological pressure (secondary carotenoids) [23] . The Chlorophyceae family contains most important genera for carotenoid production. Dunaliella salina from Chlorophyceae family is considered as a source of \u03b2-carotene production when it encounters with extreme conditions, such as high light density, nutrition deficiency, and salinity. It can also produce \u03b1-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin but is generally used for large scale \u03b2-carotene production [24] . Genus Chlorella and Scenedesmus genera are prominent sources of lutein therefore they are used in large scale of lutein production [25] . Tetraselmis suecica is marine green algae, which is generally used for aquaculture nutrition and rich for tocopherol [26] . Haematococcus pluvialis is widely used for astaxanthin production for a long period of time [27] . Chlamydomonas and Muriellopsis are some other examples of carotenoid producing microalgae and also lycopene, fucoxanthin, canthaxanthin, echinenone, and dinoxanthin are some examples of carotenoids from the Chlorophyceae family [28] . Macroalgae (seaweeds) are also noticeable sources of carotenoids, such as fucoxanthin, lutein, \u03b2-carotene and siphonaxanthin [29] . Especially brown algae species are important sources of fucoxanthin. Hijikia fusiformis, Sargassum sp., Undaria pinnatifida, Fucus sp., Laminaria sp., Alaria crassifolia, Ishige okamurae, Cystoseira hakodatensis, Eisenia bicyclis, Myagropsis myagroides, Cladosiphon okamuranus, Petalonia binghamiae, Hijikia fusiformis, Kjellmaniella crassifolia, and Padina tetrastromatica are important examples for their fucoxanthin content [30] . Seagrasses are also important carotenoid sources. Previous articles demonstrated that Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa, Zostera noltii, Halophila stipulacea, Cymodocea nodosa, and Zostera marina are producers of several carotenoids such as \u03b2-carotene, lutein, lutein epoxide, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, neoxanthin, siphonaxanthintype, and violaxanthin [31, 32] .",

Sponges (Pomifera) contain more than 40 carotenoids, generally aryl carotenoids such as renierapurpurin, renieratene and isorenieratene which are assumed that occurs after biotransformation of fucoxanthin [33] . Phylum Cnidaria has small number of members contains carotenoids. Actinia equine, Tealia feline, and Anemonia sulcata are some examples that accumulate rare carotenoids such as 2-nor-astaxnthin, peridinin and actinioerythrin [34] . Mollusks contain numerous types of carotenoids. It has been shown that shellfishes contain \u03b2-carotene, lutein A, zeaxanthin, diatoxanthin, astaxanthin, etc. [34] . Bivalves and chitons also contain several carotenoids including fucoxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, diaxanthin, and peridinin [35] . In Crustacea phylum, crabs, shrimps, and lobsters generally accumulate astaxanthin, which is biotransformed from \u03b2-carotene after consumption of algae [35] . Sea urchins, holothurians, and starfishes from Echinodermata contain several carotenoids such as \u03b2-carotene, echinenone, canthaxanthin, astaxanthin and fucoxanthin [30] . Tunicates also biotransform carotenoid obtained from phytoplankton consumption, such as alloxanthin, fucoxanthin, mytiloxanthin, mytiloxanthinone, and halocynthiaxanthin [36] . Moreover, salmon fish accumulates astaxanthin in their muscles, which makes them valuable dietary carotenoid source [35] .",

Free radicals are not completely harmful in fact; our body also needs free radicals in the production and activation of some vital hormones [42] . Free radicals also come into play in the body in case of infection and removal of foreign substances, but they can also cause damage to the structure of healthy cells, such as DNA protein, and lipids and cause many diseases [43] . Bio membranes and intracellular organelles are sensitive to oxidative attacks due to the presence of unsaturated fatty acids in membrane phospholipids. When lipid peroxides formed by oxidation of lipids are destroyed, aldehydes, most of which are biologically active, are formed. These compounds are either metabolized at the cell level or diffuse from their original domains and spread damage to other parts of the cell. Malondialdehyde (MDA) occurs in the peroxidation of fatty acids containing three or more double bonds. MDA and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) formed as a result of lipid peroxidation are known to react with nucleotides and cause mutagenesis and carcinogenesis [44, 45] . Amino acids that make up proteins tend to oxidize to a higher degree than lipids in general because they contain carboxyl and amino groups. These molecules contain reduced carbon atoms that will undergo oxidative transformation in their side chains. In many studies, diseases such as Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's, renal tumor formation and rheumatoid arthritis have been associated with increased protein carbonyl groups [46] .",

Disequilibrium between the production and elimination of ROS is defined as oxidative stress and numerous studies have shown the important roles of oxidative stress in propagation of cancer [49] . ROS can trigger many aspects of tumor development and progression, which can be divided into the cellular proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, tissue invasion and metastasis and angiogenesis. ROS can trigger number of signaling pathways like extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), Wnt, Src, NF-\u03baB, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K/Akt), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [45, 48] . Permanent oxidative stress due to high ROS level in antioxidant system weakness can activate Akt, ERK and c-MYC like oncogenes by inhibiting tumor suppressors such as p53 and Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) [45] . ROS also play an important role in the spread of cancer and tumor formation in a secondary place. In the case of metastasis, ROS can interact with the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix.

IC 50 value of DPPH scavenging activity was found to be 0.30 mM and it has been stated that fucoxanthin was more active than ascorbic acid, BHA, and \u03b1-tocopherol positive controls. When compared to positive controls fucoxanthin had lower effect in scavenging the hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radicals. In reducing power assay fucoxanthin showed higher activity than positive controls [71] . In a similar study, DPPH radical scavenging IC 50 value of fucoxanthin was found 201.2 \u00b1 21.4 \u00b5g/mL while \u03b2-carotene exhibited lower activity. In ferric reducing activity, fucoxanthin and astaxanthin were found to be more active than \u03b2-carotene. Results showed that fucoxanthin caused a 63% reduction in chemiluminescence in blood neutrophils and a 3.3-fold increase in reduced and oxidized glutathione in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner [72] . Xia et al. reported that fucoxanthin from Odontella aurita marine diatom showed potent antioxidant effects in DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities. EC 50 values were found to be 140 and 30 \u00b5g/mL, respectively [73] . In a different study conducted by Sujatha et al. (2017) , DPPH radical scavenging effect of fucoxanthin from brown seaweed Sargassum wightii with an EC 50 value of 322.58 \u00b5g/mL was detected [74] . Fucoxanthin from Sargassum filipendula brown seaweed exhibited a strong DPPH radical scavenging activity with 1.4174 \u00b1 0.0126 \u00b5g/L EC value [75] .",

Fucoxanthin is the most ample carotenoid in the nature and it is mostly found in marine environment [101] . Because of the health benefits of fucoxanthin, there are various in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies for its bioavailability. Sugawara et al. had investigated bioavailability of Fucoxanthin and ten other carotenoids in an in vitro study via using Caco-2 cellular line, which is originated from gastrointestinal system. Results demonstrated that Fucoxanthin has one of the lowest bioavailability among other studied carotenoids [102] . In a further study same cell line was used and results revealed that, even though cells successfully absorb fucoxanthin, it is rapidly deacetylated and converted to Fucoxanthinol [103] . Correspondingly, another further in vitro study had showed that fucoxanthinol had transformed to amarouciaxanthin A by human hepatoma HepG2 cells [104] . Pharmacokinetic parameters of Fucoxanthin were also studied in vivo model, 0.105 mg of Fucoxanthin was administered to 6 mice via intragastric route [105] . Results showed that Fucoxanthin was not accumulating in the studied parts of mice such as lung, kidney, heart, erythrocytes, liver and spleen. On the opposite, metabolites of fucoxanthin, fucoxanthinol and amarouciaxanthin A reached their maximum concentration in 4 h and decreased steadily for 24 h. In the adipose tissue metabolites were still detectable for after a week. These results were corresponding with previous in vitro studies. Moreover, in a subsequent study, fucoxanthinol and amarouciaxanthin A accumulation in adipose tissue were confirmed after feeding mice with Fucoxanthin for 14 days [106] . It was theorized that Conjugated double bond system forms most of the basic properties of carotenoids, also affects how these molecules are attached into biological membranes. Although the way these molecules interact with reactive oxygen species differs due to their chain length and end groups, their in vivo behavior may differ from that seen in solution.

                "text": "Fucoxanthin and astaxanthin are the most abundant carotenoids from marine organisms consequently these two are the most studied marine carotenoids for their bioavailability. Fucoxanthin is the most ample carotenoid in the nature and it is mostly found in marine environment [101] . Because of the health benefits of fucoxanthin, there are various in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies for its bioavailability. Sugawara et al. had investigated bioavailability of Fucoxanthin and ten other carotenoids in an in vitro study via using Caco-2 cellular line, which is originated from gastrointestinal system. Results demonstrated that Fucoxanthin has one of the lowest bioavailability among other studied carotenoids [102] . In a further study same cell line was used and results revealed that, even though cells successfully absorb fucoxanthin, it is rapidly deacetylated and converted to Fucoxanthinol [103] . Correspondingly, another further in vitro study had showed that fucoxanthinol had transformed to amarouciaxanthin A by human hepatoma HepG2 cells [104] . Pharmacokinetic parameters of Fucoxanthin were also studied in vivo model, 0.105 mg of Fucoxanthin was administered to 6 mice via intragastric route [105] . Results showed that Fucoxanthin was not accumulating in the studied parts of mice such as lung, kidney, heart, erythrocytes, liver and spleen. On the opposite, metabolites of fucoxanthin, fucoxanthinol and amarouciaxanthin A reached their maximum concentration in 4 h and decreased steadily for 24 h. In the adipose tissue metabolites were still detectable for after a week. These results were corresponding with previous in vitro studies. Moreover, in a subsequent study, fucoxanthinol and amarouciaxanthin A accumulation in adipose tissue were confirmed after feeding mice with Fucoxanthin for 14 days [106] . It was theorized that with application of higher doses of fucoxanthin, it is possible to accumulate Fucoxanthin in mammalian tissues without any transformation. In a study with rats, it was shown that after 65 mg/kg intake of fucoxanthin, it reaches its maximum plasma level after 7.7 h with concentration of 29.1 \u00b5g/L [107] . Few studies were conducted on bioavailability of fucoxanthin in humans. In a study, 18 volunteers were orally administrated with Kambu extract which was containing 31 mg fucoxanthin and their blood samples were collected for 24 h. Results revealed that only fucoxanthinol was found in samples with maximum concentration of 44 nmol/L. Fucoxanthin and amarouciaxanthin A were not detected in plasma [108] . The outcome of the study declared by researchers was fucoxanthin in humans seems to have lower bioaccessibility in humans when compared to other carotenoids such as lutein and \u03b2-carotene. When considered the low bioavailability of fucoxanthin, different strategies were developed to increase it. In a study, rats were fed with brown seaweed, Padina tetrastromatica L., and chitosan-glycolipid hybrid nanogels were prepared for increasing the bioavailability. Results demonstrated that nanogels were improved the bioavailability more than 3-fold when compared to control group [109] . In addition, another study showed that fucoxanthin enriched Phaeodactylum tricornutum bioavailability can be increased with preparation of nanoparticles coated with casein and chitosan. C max value was increased from 10.29 \u00b1 0.1 to 33.66 \u00b1 0.5 pmol/mL [110] . In a more recent study, it has been shown that digalactosylmonoacylglycerol and sulfoquinovosylmonoacylglycerol presence significantly increases both uptake and transport of fucoxanthin in Caco-2 cells [111] .",

This valuable potential of astaxanthin for human health leads to studies of its bioavailability. In a double blind randomized study, 28 health volunteers were ingested 250 g farmed or wild salmon which contain 5 \u00b5g Astaxanthin per gram for 2 weeks. The source of astaxanthin for wild salmon is krill while farmed ones were fed with synthetic type. Results showed that aqua cultured salmon leads to higher bioavailability; aquacultured salmon group reached 42 nmol/L while wild salmon group measured 27.3 nmol/L in day 3. It was reported that difference in bioavailability originated from isomerization [112] . In another study, pharmacokinetics of astaxanthin was examined in 3 middle-aged male volunteers with consumption of 100 mg racemic astaxanthin mixture in olive oil. Results demonstrated that astaxanthin concentration reached its maximum level after 7 h (1.3 mg/mL) and it was still observable in plasma for 72 h [113] . Results indicate that astaxanthin reaches significant levels in plasma without any biotransformation contrasting Fucoxanthin. Another clinical study was investigated the difference in bioavailability of astaxanthin between commercial food supplement and lipid-based formulation containing Haematococcus pluvialis green microalgae with 40 mg of astaxanthin [114] . Results revealed that lipid-based formulation achieved approximately 4-fold increment in bioavailability (1347 to 4960 \u00b5g h/L). In addition C max value increased significantly from 55.2 to 191.5 \u00b5g/L. It is known that bioavailability may be affected various parameters such as sex, age, obesity, smoking, lifestyle, etc. In another study, effect of smoking on astaxanthin bioavailability and pharmacokinetic parameters was investigated on human volunteers. Results indicated that smoking significantly affected pharmacokinetic parameters for astaxanthin by reducing the half-life of elimination 30.5 h to 18.5 h. In addition, AUC value is lower in smoking group when compared to non-smoking volunteers, 6.52 and 7.53 \u00b5g h/L, respectively [115] . Even though, astaxanthin reaches sufficient plasma levels without biotransformation, still some metabolites of astaxanthin in human body were detected. 3-hydroxy-4-oxo-\u03b2-ionone, 3-hydroxy-4-oxo-\u03b2-ionone, 3-hydroxy-4-oxo-\u03b2-ionol, 3-hydroxy-4-oxo-7,8-dihydro-\u03b2-ionol was detected in two human volunteers via GC-MS analysis [116] .",

Double emulsion solvent displacement method was used for preparing SLNs. SLN formulation (50 mg stearic acid, 6.11% bioactive, and poloxamer 188, lecithin ratio of 1:6) was optimized with a 213 nm particle size. On the pheochromocytoma-12 cell line, the antioxidant potential of Asx-SLNs was evaluated against H2O2 induced toxicity. Radiolabeled nanoparticles were found to be 96-98% stable even for 48 h and higher drug concentration in the brain was achieved by intranasal administration, which was compared to 99mTc labeled nanoparticles intravenous route and confirmed by gamma scintigraphy analysis. It was shown that this nasal system can provide the most neuroprotection in neurological disorders from oxidative stress under in vitro conditions [132] . Shanmugapriya and colleagues designed to emulsion-based delivery systems to increase the bioavailability of astaxanthin and \u03b1-tocopherol as active compounds for various biomedical applications. Anticancer potential of astaxanthin-\u03b1-tocopherol nanoemulsion prepared with spontaneous and ultrasonication emulsification methods was evaluated with optimizing production conditions for better resistance and toxicity testing against microbial infections. It could be said that this delivery system may be a starting point for prospective studies for cancer treatment applications [133] .",

These formulations provided to increased physicochemical stability, water dispersibility, therapeutic effects (antioxidant and anticancer) of lutein. In other studies with nano-emulsion based delivery system, formulation components, process steps, emulsifier types and concentrations storage pH and temperature played a key role on stability and effectiveness of lutein. Emulsion formulation revealed proper stability thus coating oil droplets in emulsions was increased the physicochemical stability of lutein compared to uncoated. In vitro bioaccessibility and chemical stability of lutein emulsions were found higher than non-capsulated forms. Protection of bioactive lutein against UV irradiation was evaluated and in depression lutein was found that 14%, 6-8%, and only 0.06% from nanoemulsion, NLCs and SLNs.

It has been known that marine organisms serve as an extensive source for bioactive secondary metabolites due to their viability in extreme environments and conditions. In particular, carotenoids obtained from marine organisms displayed promising activity against various oxidative stress related disorders, and epidemiological studies revealed that the populations consuming carotenoid rich diets have lower oxidative stress related disorder risk. Although several activities of such compounds were shown by in vitro, in vivo, and several clinical studies, there is a need for advanced biological and molecular studies revealing the efficacy, activity mechanism, and metabolism. Bioavailability is an important factor to consider when developing suitable formulations with health benefits, since new delivery systems were produced for better bioavailability. ",

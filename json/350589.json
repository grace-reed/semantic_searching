                "text": "Arginine vasotocin (AVT) and its mammalian homologue, arginine vasopressin (AVP), are nonapeptides that play important roles in the regulation of social behavior in diverse vertebrate groups. For example, AVT/AVP stimulates sexual behavior in amphibians [Moore and Miller, 1983; Marler et al., 1995] , influences social bonding in mammals [Winslow et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1994] , and is associated with aggression and social dominance in fish, birds, and mammals [Goodson and Bass, 2001; Goodson, 2008; reviewed in Albers, 2012; Godwin and Thompson, 2012] . These diverse behavioral effects are mediated primarily by forebrain AVT/AVP cell groups, the most conserved of which are located in the preoptic area and hypothalamus, with projection patterns that extend out to the pituitary, forebrain, and hindbrain [reviewed in Goodson and Bass, 2001; Goodson and Thompson, 2010] . In many species, social stimuli activate AVT/ AVP cells and are associated with the subsequent release of these peptides in the brain. For example, positive social stimuli (e.g., contact with a sexual partner or same-sex bird) activate AVT cells in the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis of males in several gregarious bird species [Goodson and Wang, 2006; Goodson, 2008] , and the subsequent release of AVT from those cells into the septum mediates behavioral preferences for large groups [Kelly et al., 2011] . However, the behavioral effects of AVT/AVP can vary considerably depending on the context of the social signal. In male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), AVP release in the anterior hypothalamus is higher in response to social contact with a male or female stranger, compared to contact with a pair bond partner, and is associated with selective aggression towards unfamiliar individuals. Yet, these males still maintain a high level of social affiliation with their female partners [Gobrogge et al., 2007] . Thus, social cues that drive endogenous AVT/ AVP release in neural circuits underlying behavior are likely important factors that facilitate appropriate responses to the social environment, including the display of both prosocial and antisocial behaviors.",

Certain social signals may trigger AVT/AVP release in some behavioral circuits but not others, thus facilitating responses that are context specific and even exerting the opposite effect on the same behavior in different contexts. In fact, positively and negatively valenced social stimuli activate different populations of AVT/AVP cells in zebra finches [Goodson and Wang, 2006] and mice [Ho et al., 2010] , and in several avian species endogenous AVT facilitates aggression in the context of mate competition, but either reduces it or has no effect in other social contexts [Goodson et al., 2009; Kabelik et al., 2009] . These studies indicate that it is critical to learn more about how social stimuli that promote alternative behavioral responses influence AVT circuits in the brain.",

                "text": "Goldfish (Carassius auratus) are a good model in which to further investigate the social stimuli that generate context-dependent AVT effects. Goldfish are a highly social species that congregate in mixed-sex groups [Ma-gurran and Pitcher, 1983; Kavaliers, 1989] . During the breeding season, males engage in a 'scramble competition' for mates, in which many individuals compete for access to a single female [Taborsky, 2001] ; however, males rarely engage in overt forms of aggression. Instead, they use 'chasing' and 'pushing' behaviors to ensure contact with ovulating females and to outcompete rival males. In these animals, AVT influences the simple approach responses that may underlie these behaviors. Intracranial administration of AVT in male goldfish inhibits the tendency to approach conspecifics through its effects on the hindbrain [Thompson et al., 2008b; Thompson and Walton, 2009] . In some social situations, a reduced tendency to approach a conspecific could be advantageous: for example, withdrawing from a rival male if the probability of winning a competition is low. Yet, in other cases, it could be disadvantageous. Failing to chase females when they are ready to release eggs would decrease a male's probability of reproduction. This raises the critical question, what factors regulate AVTinduced social avoidance in goldfish in a way that generates the appropriate behavioral response for a given social situation?",

Goldfish use a well-characterized suite of chemical signals to communicate socially relevant information, which are known to affect the behavior and physiology of males and females [reviewed in Stacey et al., 2003 ]. One of the major steroidal pheromones produced by both sexes is androstenedione (AD). Females release a pheromone mixture that contains AD approximately 12 h prior to ovulation, long before they are ready to spawn, and the levels of AD subsequently decline as ovulation approaches [Scott and Sorensen, 1994] , whereas sexually active males release comparatively larger quantities of AD, particularly when paired with male and/or female conspecifics [Sorensen et al., 2005] . Such social stimuli could activate AVT cells or drive peptide release in specific neural circuits that mediate appropriate behavioral responses. Thus, AVT-induced social avoidance could play an important role in coordinating male-female interactions to coincide with ovulation or in mediating male-male competitive interactions.",

To do this, we exposed males to AD or a control solution and tested their willingness to approach other males (potential rivals) and females (potential mates) in a social approach paradigm. To isolate the effects of the pheromonal signal, we used a visual approach paradigm, in which males were prevented from physical or chemical contact with other individuals but could interact socially across a Plexiglas barrier. We have previously demonstrated that goldfish can make sexual discriminations using only visual cues , although males and females do not obviously differ in appearance to the human eye. We also asked whether AD influences the production of AVT in neural circuits that are likely involved in generating these approach/avoidance responses. Specifically, we measured AVT gene expression in the parvocellular, magnocellular, and gigantocellular populations of the preoptic area. In other teleosts, AVT in the different preoptic nuclei is associated with distinct social responses; levels of AVT mRNA and protein expression in the parvocellular portion of the preoptic area correlate strongly with the tendency to flee from a social encounter, whereas increased AVT in the magno-and gigantocellular portions is associated with increased aggression and courtship behaviors [Semsar and Godwin, 2003; Greenwood et al., 2008; Dewan and Tricas, 2011] . Thus, if AD regulates the influences of AVT on approach behavior in goldfish in a social context-dependent manner, we predicted that the effects of AD should differ in different preoptic regions, or that AD would induce AVT only in preoptic nuclei associated with social avoidance.",

The testing tank consisted of a central 70-liter experimental chamber (25 cm long \u00d7 42 cm wide \u00d7 35.5 cm deep) bordered on each side by an 18-liter chamber (16.5 cm long \u00d7 42 cm wide \u00d7 35.5 cm deep) used to hold stimulus fish.

We then placed either an unfamiliar male or female fish into the stimulus chamber opposite the side in which the subject male spent more time in proximity. The stimulus fish was chosen at random from a single-sex group tank on both days of testing. With the stimulus fish in the chamber, we used a peristaltic pump to deliver a solution containing either AD dissolved in 95% methanol (final concentration: 1 \u00d7 10 -7 M ; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) or methanol vehicle to the experimental chamber on the side containing the stimulus fish at a rate of 10 ml/min. The outlet of the tube delivering the solution was positioned just below the water surface in the center of the Plexiglas partition. We chose the dose of AD based on the concentration that has been demonstrated to elicit the greatest response from the olfactory epithelium of male goldfish [Sorensen et al., 2005] . Flow rates were adapted from Poling et al. [2001] . We again recorded the behavior of the subject fish for 15 min. We defined social approach behavior as the time the subject fish spent in proximity to the stimulus fish minus the time spent in proximity to that same side during the initial side preference test. The order of exposure to AD or vehicle solution was counterbalanced across the 2 days of testing.",

For the gigantocellular nucleus, we started at the most caudal section that contained gigantocellular AVT expression and continued rostrally until this nucleus disappeared. The three nuclei each contain cell populations that are easily distinguished by their soma size (parvocellular < magnocellular < gigantocellular); however, our sampling of magnocellular and gigantocellular nuclei often included more than one cell type ( fig. 1 d-f) .

In the present study, we demonstrate that a social cue released by both males and females, the pheromone AD, can evoke similar behaviors as AVT administration, but this effect is dependent on the context of the social interaction. We show that AD exposure induces social avoidance in males in response to the presence of another male, but it does not appear to affect the willingness of males to approach the visual stimuli of females. We also show that AD increases AVT gene expression in the preoptic area, which suggests that this social cue may inhibit social approach towards other males by activating the AVT system. AD is likely an important signal that selectively mediates male-male interactions in goldfish in multisex social groups. During spawning, small groups of males actively chase ovulating females, frequently initiating physical contact with each other ('pushing') in order to maintain a position closest to the female [DeFraipont and Sorensen, 1993; Kobayashi et al., 2002] . Typically, only one or a few males will engage in a spawning act with a female, in which both sexes will release eggs or sperm into vegetation, so social spacing and proximity to the female are important factors in determining mating success. Spawning male goldfish release large quantities of AD (on average, 15\u00d7 more AD than unstimulated males [Sorensen et al., 2005] ), which we have shown acts as a signal to inhibit other males from approaching. In other contexts, AD stimulates aggression (pushing) in males housed in the same tank [Poling et al., 2001] , indicating that AD can induce different behavioral responses in different social environments, perhaps promoting aggression if a male perceives that he is dominant, or if he cannot retreat, and social withdrawal if he perceives that he is subordinate or if there is an avenue for escape. Importantly, our results show that AD can suppress the social approach behavior of goldfish males in a way that would likely reduce their ability to compete for females in a scramble competition. Although a relatively understudied phenomenon, the behavioral function of pheromones meant for intermale signaling has also been investigated in other species, such as the red-spotted newt [Notophthalmus vuridescens; Park and Propper, 2001] and leek moth [Acrolepiopsis assectella; Lecomte et al., 1998 ], in which sexually stimulated males produce pheromones that repel other males competing for mates, thereby increasing the reproductive success of the signaler. Such a system may also benefit the receiver, because pheromone-induced social avoidance allows him to avoid engaging in costly agonistic interactions, perhaps especially when his likelihood of winning is low. As a social signal in goldfish, AD appears to be very effective in selectively reducing male-male interactions, apparently without influencing the frequency or probability of male-female interactions .",

                "text": "We also demonstrate that AD exposure increases endogenous AVT in the brain. Fish exposed to AD had increased levels of AVT mRNA in the preoptic area, as measured by in situ hybridization, suggesting that either a greater number of preoptic neurons were producing AVT or that all AVT cells were producing more mRNA in response to the social stimulus. Unfortunately, our method of quantifying AVT expression does not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities. Taken together with our behavioral study, these results suggest that endogenous AVT release in response to social cues could mediate male-male competition in goldfish and, perhaps more importantly, could regulate more general behavioral processes related to a decrease in sociality. In goldfish, administration of an AVT V1a receptor antagonist blocks the behavioral effects of exogenously administered AVT [Walton et al., 2010] and stimulates social approach in males Walton et al., 2010] , indicating that endogenous levels are important in predicting the general tendency of males to investigate a conspecific. In the current study, the same social cue that increased AVT in the preoptic area of goldfish males also induced social avoidance in response to another male. We had predicted that AD might also inhibit approach to-wards females, because they release AD before they are ready to spawn. However, our results show that while AD decreases time spent approaching male conspecifics, it does not appear to affect behavior towards females, suggesting that the circuit activated by AD does not modulate approach responses to females. The AVT/AVP system is directly associated with social avoidance in only two other species. In rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss), intracranial administration of an AVT V1a receptor antagonist increased the latency to withdraw from an agonistic encounter [Backstrom and Winberg, 2009] , and in rats an olfactory signal from sick animals promotes avoidance in conspecifics by activating the AVP system in animals that come in contact with the odor [Arakawa et al., 2010] . In some fish species, higher endogenous levels of AVT are correlated with the reduced tendency to display territorial or aggressive behaviors. In the highly territorial beaugregory damselfish (Stegastes leucostictus), the density of AVT-ir fibers in the preoptic area is negatively correlated with the number of times an individual fish approaches and attempts to bite an intruder [Santangelo and Bass, 2010] , and in cichlids (Astatotilapia burtoni), adopting a nonterritorial reproductive strategy is associated with higher overall levels of AVT gene expression in the anterior preoptic area [Greenwood et al., 2008] . However, there are several other examples in fish in which increased AVT gene expression is associated with social dominance and increased aggression [Godwin et al., 2000; Aubin-Horth et al., 2007; Greenwood et al., 2008] , therefore differences in the patterns of AVT expression in the brain are likely associated with changes in social behavior in a complex way, and may reflect differences in the functional effects of AVT in divergent species and/or differences in AVT neural circuitry underlying behavior.",

                "text": "In fact, Greenwood et al. [2008] recently suggested that AVT in different preoptic cell populations in A. burtoni is associated with the regulation of different behaviors, perhaps through different neural circuitry. In that study, AVT in the parvocellular nucleus is associated with subordinate fleeing behaviors, whereas AVT mRNA expression in the magno-and gigantocellular populations is associated with the expression of territorial behavior. Given our finding that AD induces social withdrawal in response to other males, we expected to find AD-induced AVT specifically in the parvocellular population. Planned post hoc comparisons showed that AVT induction in response to AD was only significant in the parvocellular portion of the preoptic area, but we did not find a treatment-brain region interaction, so we cannot rule out the possibility of AD-induced AVT expression in the magnoand gigantocellular nuclei that could also play a role in regulating withdrawal behavior. Although little is known about the connectivity of individual cell populations in the preoptic area of goldfish, or any fish species, it is clear that some AVT-ir cells from the preoptic area send dense projections to hindbrain autonomic control regions, including the dorsal motor vagus and area postrema [Thompson and Walton, 2009] , which play an important role in the effects of AVT on approach behavior in this species by activating a peripheral feedback loop that ultimately promotes social withdrawal [Thompson et al., 2008b] . Thus, we hypothesize that AD could induce social withdrawal in males by activating that circuit. Alternatively, or in addition, AD could activate AVT cells that project to the optic tectum in goldfish [Thompson and Walton, 2009] and thus directly modulate the processing of visual stimuli in ways that lead to decreased social approach. A similar mechanism by which AVT mediates cross-modal sensorimotor integration has been shown in male roughskin newts, in which female sex pheromones enhance the processing of somatosensory stimuli involved in the regulation of courtship clasping [Thompson et al., 2008a] .",

Here we have shown that AD, an important chemical signal in the context of repro-duction, induces similar behavioral responses as intracerebral AVT, inducing social avoidance in response to rival males, but not in response to receptive females. Exposure to AD also increases AVT mRNA expression in the preoptic nucleus of males, suggesting that this communication signal specifically influences male-male interactions by activating a brain circuit, which includes AVT projections to hindbrain vagal efferents, that probably influences social behavior through the integration of peripheral and central effects. Furthermore, AD-induced AVT expression was most robust in the parvocellular population of the preoptic area, suggesting that this brain region in particular may be part of that circuit. We suggest that it would be informative for future studies to investigate the selective AVT responses in separate cell populations of the preoptic nucleus, particularly in different social contexts, in order to better understand how different neuromodulatory pathways shape social approach behavior.",

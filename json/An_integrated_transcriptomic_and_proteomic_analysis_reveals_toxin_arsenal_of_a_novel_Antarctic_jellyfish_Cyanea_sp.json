We successfully captured a kind of jellyfish 200 m underwater in Antarctica, and identified it as a jellyfish Cyanea sp. through morphological examination and MT-CO1 phylogenetic analysis. A total of 40,468 unigenes were harvested through transcriptome sequencing. We also successfully annotated 12,955 (32.01%) unigenes with the NR database, 10,882 (26.89%) unigenes with the SWISSPROT database, 4951 (12.23%) unigenes with the GO database, and 4901 (12.11%) unigenes with the KEGG database. In the proteomic analysis, a total of 11,159 peptides and 2630 proteins were harvested using the constructed transcriptome as the database. A number of 771 (29.31%) and 841 (31.98%) proteins were annotated against the GO and KEGG database, respectively. Moreover, a number of 29 toxic proteins matched from the 145 toxin-related unigenes were successfully screened, including 6 metalloproteinases, 4 phospholipases, 2 serine proteases, 1 serine protease inhibitor, 7 toxin-related venom and 9 other toxins.

As among the most ancient marine organisms, jellyfish show strong vitality and wide adaptability, which has resulted in the significant growth of the number of jellyfish in coastal areas from late spring into the early autumn in recent decades globally [4, 5] , greatly impacting human production and life and causing environmental [6] and health problems [7] . Although dozens of papers about the jellyfish transcriptome and proteome have been published [8] [9] [10] , only types of jellyfish with large abundances, lethal toxins or special biological characters such as Chironex fleckeri [10, 11] , Aurelia aurita [12] , Irukandji jellyfish [13, 14] , Physalia physalis [15, 16] and Cyanea nozakii [17] , are research hotspots today. However, there still remains a massive amount of potential data to be generated, considering that there are 456 different subfamilies of jellyfish, according to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) on 5th March 2017 [2] .",

We first performed the molecular identification of the captured polar jellyfish by PCR amplification, sequencing and alignment of mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (MT-COI, CO1), which functions as a catalytic subunit and is a common molecule for species identification because of its high conservation. Sequences sharing > 97% of the CO1 sequence identity are generally considered to represent the same species [28] .

Laternula sp., which is obviously an incorrect identification and can be easily ruled out from the morphological assessment. However, starting with the second aligned sequence from the jellyfish Cyanea tzetlinii, the subsequent 99 aligned sequences are all from the cnidarian group with a scale of identities of 83.15-84.70%.

We did not obtain an alignment with the CO1 protein sequence from Cf. Laternula sp. Instead, the most aligned protein sequence, with an identity of 98.10%, is from the jellyfish Cyanea sp.. The top 100 aligned sequences are all derived from jellyfish and have much higher identities (91.78-98.10%) than the DNA CO1 sequence alignments. This can be explained by the degeneracy and wobble phenomenon, which results in a looser alignment between nucleotides than between proteins. Sequence alignment shows that the identities of the two CO1 protein sequences from C. capillata and C. tzetlinii with the BD-4 CO1 sequence were 97.63% and 96.80%, respectively. In comparison to the CO1 sequence from Cyanea tzetlinii, the protein from the polar jellyfish displays three mutations, namely, F166 L, M173 L and L178 M, and lacks several amino acids (or segments), including K 1~A21 , W 78 , L 101~L114 , W 122 , V 182~A200 , and W 233 (Fig. 1C) . Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with 7 typical species, namely, C. capillata (AJE61222.1, 97.26%), C. tzetlinii (AJE61240.1, 96.80%), Nemopilema nomurai (ACB29734.1, 93.02%), Phacellophora camtschatica (ACZ67472.1, 93.15%), Aurelia sp. (ACZ67464.1, 93.15%), Chrysaora pacifica (BAW87744.1, 93.61%) and Pelagia noctiluca (ACZ67467.1, 93.61%) ( Fig. 1D ). Consistent with the sequence identities, the species closest to BD-4 are the jellyfish C. capillata and C. tzetlinii, followed by N. nomurai, P. camtschatica and A. sp. Moreover, a total of 22 CO1 sequences from Cyanea aligned with the BD-4 sequence, making Cyanea the most frequently hit genus and supporting our conclusion that the captured BD-4 jellyfish can be identified as an Antarctic jellyfish Cyanea sp..",

Only the terms with > 100 unigenes or 10 proteins were selected for further analysis. Among the 21 selected BP terms (Fig. 4A ), the number of unigenes drops from 6377 (15.76%) in cellular process to 123 (0.30%) in presynaptic process involved in chemical synaptic transmission (PPICS), while the number of proteins decreases from 959 (36.47%) in cellular process to 1 (0.85%) in biological phase. Although the number of annotated unigenes is much larger than that of annotated proteins, a greater percentage of proteins than unigenes were annotated with BP terms, and the former exhibits similar annotations as the latter, albeit with sharply decreased numbers of sequences for each term, with the same ranking of the top 4 terms, i.e., cellular process, single-organism process, metabolic process and biological regulation. 8, 7, and 5 terms have higher, similar and lower percentages of proteins vs. unigenes, respectively, using 1. The term biological adhesion (2.44) displays a high ratio, probably due to the high distribution of mucus on the jellyfish surface.

According to BLAST annotation of the transcriptome with the NR databases, a total of 145 toxin-related unigenes were successfully screened (Table 1), including  42 metalloproteinases, 12 phospholipases, 10 serine proteases, 5 serine  protease inhibitors, 20 toxin-related venoms, and 56 other toxins  (Supplementary table 1) . Some toxins such as metalloproteinases, phospholipases and serine protease are common constituents in both cnidarian and other toxic organisms such as snakes [34, 35] . Other potential toxic components such as 5\u2032-nucleotidase, venom allergen, translationally controlled tumor protein, turripeptide, ryncolin, peroxiredoxin and L-amino-acid oxidase activity were also detected. Meanwhile, a number of 29 toxins from a combined analysis of transcriptome and proteome of BD-4 was successfully screened against the Swissprot toxin database. On the whole, we found 6 metalloproteinases, 4 phospholipases, 2 serine proteases, 1 serine protease inhibitor, 7 toxin-related venom and 9 other toxins.

Furthermore, serine protease inhibitors can block the activity of trypsin, display potent activity, block potassium channels, and impair the motility of human glioblastoma cells [42, 43] . We scanned 2 serine proteases and a serine protease inhibitor that were annotated by both the proteome and transcriptome. We selected two sequences predicted as serine proteases: Cluster-3883.11579 and Cluster-3883.4328, for further analysis. A model serine protease (pdb ID: 5CE1|A) was utilized to perform the sequence alignment ( Fig. 8A ) and 3D modeling (Fig. 8B) (Fig. 8C) . The percent identity of the C. capillata sequence was the highest at 70.89. This is consistent with the first part of the study, indicating, BD-4 is Cyanea sp.",

A jellyfish consists of a gelatinous umbrella-shaped bell and trailing tentacles, which are responsible for locomotion and prey capture. The mouth/anus of the gastric pouch is located at the base of the bell and surrounded by oral arms.

Usually, a 97% sequence homology between the conserved molecules corresponds to 70% genome similarity. Interestingly, the most aligned CO1 gene sequence, with an identity of 98.90%, was not from jellyfish but was from a species of Molluscusca Cf. Because the sample is definitely a type of jellyfish on the basis of morphological characterization, we explained this high match as the result of horizontal gene transfer, which is not common but can occur between different species and plays an important role in the evolution of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Although the similarity between the BD-4 CO1 and other jellyfish CO1 sequences was < 85% at the gene level in the BLASTn comparison, we found that the similarity was > 97% at the protein level in the BLASTx, comparison, and a total of 22 CO1 sequences among the top 100 aligned sequences were from Cyanea.

Proteomes present expressed proteins or peptides but limited information, while transcriptomes show more potential details of RNA sequences. Not all RNA sequences will be clearly translated into functional proteins or peptides, so in mechanistic studies, extra experimentations are often required to verify that the RNA of interest is translated into proteins in vivo. In the absence of a genome, de novo assembly of full-length transcripts is a very useful tool in the analysis of the transcriptomes from organisms. Previously, the transcriptome of the venom-producing jellyfish C. nozakii has a total of 40,434 detected unigenes, with the lengths ranging from 201 bp to 31,140 bp, and 1556 homologous proteins were identified in its proteomics analysis. A total of 13,041 unigenes and 801 proteins were annotated and classified by GO analysis while 11,253 unigenes and 959 proteins were classified as associated with KEGG pathways [46] . Venom-related sequences of the scyphozoan jellyfish Chrysaora fuscescens, which has > 23,000 contigs, were annotated in a tentacle transcriptomics analysis through de novo assembly.

Jellyfish, which includes species involved in the development of marine drugs, produces a complex mixture of compounds that improve the defensive actions of jellyfish [48] . For example, the box jellyfish C. fleckeri was screened for potential toxins, including metalloproteinase, alpha-macroglobulin domain containing protein, CRISP proteins and turripeptide-like protease inhibitor. Several pore-forming toxins including CfTX-1/2 and CfTX-A/B in C. fleckeri [10] , CaTX-A in Carybdea alata [49] , CrTX-A/B in Carybdea rastoni [50] , and CqTX-A in Chiropsalmus quadrigatus [51] were identified from Cubozoa. Scyphozoa produces toxins as well. By a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics, 27 proteins homologous to toxins were identified from the jellyfish C. nozakii, including phospholipase A2, zinc metalloproteinase-disintegrin, serine protease inhibitor, plancitoxin-1 and alpha-latrocrustotoxin-Lt1a [46] . Transcripts from the jellyfish C. capillata also resembled molecules with potential toxic activities, including cnidarian CfTX-like toxins with hemolytic activity, plancitoxin-1, venom toxin-like peptide-6, histamine-releasing factor, neprilysin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, vascular endothelial growth factor A, angiotensin-converting enzyme-like and endothelin-converting enzyme 1like proteinse [8, 52, 53] .

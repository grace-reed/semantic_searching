    "abstract": "All marine plants are autotrophic organisms (independent of their systematic status). They contain chlorophyll \u0430 and execute a photosynthetiic process that produces organic matter and oxygen by absorbing sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. Marine plants belong to three groups of organisms: microalgae (blue-green, diatoms, dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae); macroalgae (green, brown, and red); and higher plants or seagrasses. The latter two groups are also called macrophytes. Marine algae and seagrasses form the base of the oceanic food chain. They are the primary producers that convert sunlight energy and nutrients into plant materials and oxygen. Moreover, marine plants provide food and shelter for many types of animals and contribute to the biological diversity of coastal habitats (Littler and Littler, 2003). 2.1 CLASSIFICATION The classification of living organisms (marine plants) is called systematics or taxonomy, which reflects the evolutionary tree (phylogenetic tree) of different organisms. Taxonomy classifies organisms into different groups called taxa, while systematics identifies their relationships. In algology, the Linnaean taxonomy is dominant and includes ranks and binominal nomenclature. Plants are named according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). According to modern Linnaean taxonomy, the marine plants described or mentioned in this book belong to two empires and four kingdoms. The Empire Eukaryota is comprised of three kingdoms: Plantae, Chromista, and Protozoa, and the Empire Prokaryota includes the Kingdom Eubacteria. The Kingdom Plantae consist of seagrasses (Phylum Tracheophyta, or marine flowering plants), green algae (Phylum Chlorophyta), and red algae (Phylum Rhodophyta). The Kingdom Chromista includes brown algae (Phylum Ochrophyta, Class Phaeophyceae, and Bacillariophyceae). The Kingdom Protozoa is comprised of unicellular algae-dinoflagellates (Phylum Myzozoa). The Kingdom Eubacteria is comprised of blue-green algae (Phylum Cyanobacteria). Each phylum (division) is divided into several classes, and every class is divided into several orders. Then orders are divided into families, families into various genera, and genera into species. The classification of marine plants is given in Latin. The major differences among representatives of different Phyla (Divisions) are in their somatic and reproductive structures, life histories, photosynthetic pigments, biochemistry of their storage products, and cell-wall ultrastructure. A scientific name is given to each species, which consists of two names: the first is the generic name (genus) and the second is the specific name (species). The first letter of the generic name is capitalized and the specific name is written in lowercase. Both are italicized or underlined. It is also customary that a binomial is followed by the author of that binomial. Recently, plant names were formatted by the \"International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011\" and a global species database on all groups of algae (Guiry and Guiry, 2016). According to the code, the green alga Caulerpa racemosa (Fig. 2.1) are presented as follows: Empire Eukaryota/Kingdom Plantae/Phylum Chlorophyta/Class Ulvophyceae/Order Bryopsidales/Family Caulerpaceae/Genus Caulerpa. 2.2 IDENTIFYING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM DIFFERENT PHYLA Phylum Tracheophyta, Order Alismatales (Seagrasses) Seagrasses (marine flowering plants), inhabiting sandy and silty-sandy areas of the bottom, are one of the main components of the reef ecosystem. Some of them are able to attach to the hard base of the reef (e.g., Thalassodendron ciliatum). Seagrasses can form extensive beds or meadows in shallow-sheltered coastal waters. Similar to the terrestrial higher plants, seagrasses have roots, stems, leaves, and flowers (Fig. 2.2).",

They are characterized by the predominance of the green pigments (chlorophylls a and b), which mask carotenes, xanthophylls (such as lutein, zeaxanthin and siphonoxanthin), and other pigments. These photosynthetic pigments are located in the chloroplast's thylakoids and are grouped into stacks. The green algae's cell wall is comprised of a layer of pectin and an inner cellulose layer. Starch is its storage nutrient. Most green algae reproduce both sexually and asexually. Reproduction involves the formation of flagellated spores and the production of nonflagellated spores to a lesser degree. Alternation of generations, where the algae alternate between gametophyte and sporophyte, is common in multicellular green algae. Vegetative reproduction through the fragmentation of thalli is also common, especially in filamentous forms (Dawes, 1998) .",

The creeping axis (stolon, runner) that connects upright blades are called rhizomes. Different forms of holdfasts adapt to different types of substrates. Holdfasts come in with various structures: it could be a modified basal cell with rhizoidal filaments, a disk-like multicellular organ, or a large multicellular and well-developed branching form (socalled hapteron-like attachment). The stipe forms the stem-like structure supporting the blade, although in many species it is absent and the blade is directly sessile on the holdfast. The blade is often thin, membranous, filamentous, and branching. The types of branching fronds are important morphological characteristics, especially for identification. Macroalgae basically have seven types of branching: alternate, opposite, dichotomous, trichotomous, whorled, unilateral, and irregular ( Fig. 2.9 ).",

However, these algae are not considered as the most important group of free-living algae regarding the primary production and serving as food source for the herbivorous reef animals (Price and Scott, 1992). Turf algae represent a particular life form of algae, with characteristic biological structure and function. Taxonomically it is a diverse group containing organisms that represent various algal phyla (divisions). Members of these different divisions are commonly found on reefs and closely intermixed in multiple assemblages. The turf algae are densely growing, attached to the substratum at numerous points, and their erect branch systems arise from the prostrate axes. Some of the algae form filamentous, cushion-like tufts, bushy clumps, or tangled mats. The general morphological characteristics of turf algae are small size (to about 3 cm in height) at maturity and slender branches. Juvenile or suppressed individuals of larger macroalgae frequently occur in algal turfs (Figs. 2.18 and 2.19) .",

The light condition in the shallow part of the euphotic zone is different and mostly depends on the water transparency. In clean oceanic waters the euphotic zone can extend down to 200-250 m deep (Littler et al., 1986) . The illumination range, where plants are capable of photosynthesis and can complete their lifecycles, equals from 0.01% to 100% of photosynthetically active radiation falling on a water surface (PARS). Light is one of the major factors limiting the expansion of algae into depths. Algae usually do not grow in depths, where the light intensity is smaller than 1% of PAR S , i.e., approximately 10-15 S \u03bcE/(m 2 s) if measured at noon on a sunny day (Titlyanov, 1999) . However, the red coralline algae of the genus Lithothamnion are widely distributed in deeper sites in subtropical areas, where the illumination level ranges within 0.05-0.1% of PAR S (Molinier, 1960; Lang, 1974; Littler et al., 1986) . If interspecies competition is absent, almost all algae can survive with light intensity ranging from 1% to 100% of PAR S , despite some species being vulnerable to ultraviolet light preventing them from living in the intertidal area under direct sunlight (Yakovleva and Titlyanov, 2001; Fong and Paul, 2011) .",

The process of adaptation involves the initiation of certain mechanisms associated with numerous adaptive responses. For example, mechanisms such as maximization of light absorption, efficient utilization of absorbed light, and saving consumption of nutrients can help plants adapt to extremely low light levels. Maximization of light absorption will mainly lead to the accumulation of photosynthetic pigments. Efficient utilization of absorbed light can boost the quantum output of photosynthesis in shaded plants. Maintaining reserve and structural substances is achieved through slowing down the respiration and excretion of assimilated substances (Titlyanov and Titlyanova, 2002) .",

In tropical reef ecosystems, the water temperature usually ranges from 24\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, and its fluctuations related to different depths and winter/summer transitions are very small. Therefore the temperature, in all likelihood, does not belong to factors that limit the distribution of marine plants in the subtidal zone. In contrast, in supratidal and intertidal pools, the water can warm up to 40-45\u00b0C, which limits the settlement of many algal species in this ecological niche. The salinity of water in coastal ecosystems of continents and large islands depends on the amount of precipitation and ranges within 24-34\u2030. Due to the natural resistance of marine plants to salinity fluctuations, temporary small changes in water salinity on coral reefs exert almost no effect on their viability and the structure of their communities. The desalination of seawater that occurs close to estuaries of large rivers affects symbiotic corals much more than marine algae. The corals could suffer from osmotic shock and lose their zooxanthellae partially or entirely. If they cannot recover after the shock, they will die and then get occupied by epilithic algae (Titlyanov et al., 2000 (Titlyanov et al., , 2008 Diaz-Pulido and McCook, 2002) .",

Nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae can increase nitrogen concentration and benefit the balance of nitrogen-containing substances in the coral-reef ecosystem (McClanahan et al., 2007) . On coral reefs there is enough phosphorus due to its turnover within the ecosystem (Atkinson, 2011). However, some studies have shown that phosphorus can be removed from the ecosystems as a result of calcium binding to phosphate ions; if so, the algae will also suffer from a phosphorus shortage (Fong et al., 1993) .",

For example, in the supratidal zone the grazing of algae by fish and invertebrates is almost excluded. However, in the intertidal area, grazing is determined by tides and water turbulence associated with tidal currents and surf. Grazing by herbivorous animals is an important factor of succession control for algal communities. It regulates the rate of biomass accumulation and frequency and intensity of reproduction in the individual plant. The major herbivorous animals on coral reefs are fishes, sea urchins, and gastropod mollusks (Glynn and Enochs, 2011; Montgomery, 2011). It is important to note that small herbivorous animals can exert beneficial effects on the growth of macroalgae, as they remove epiphytic vegetation (Hay, 1997) .",

On these reefs, the percentage of bottom covered by coral is around 80-90% without change for years. However, after damage to coral reefs, especially after massive mortality of scleractinian corals, the competition between algae and corals for newly available substrates becomes crucial for restoring and maintaining the reef ecosystem. Dead and damaged coral colonies are occupied by benthic micro-and macroalgae during the first year after a ecological disaster. The coverage of the carbonate reef base by living corals decreases, whereas the degree of algal coverage increases. These changes may result in an ecological shift, where the benthic algae displace corals from substrate and the entire reef, so that the coral reefs transform (obviously temporarily) into \"plant\" reefs (McCook et al., 2001; Titlyanov and Titlyanova, 2008; Chadwick and Morrow, 2011) .",

According to this hypothesis, hermatypic corals containing zooxanthellae usually successively occupy substrate and space under the conditions of intensive grazing of macrobenthic algae by animals, moderate levels of wave actions, and low concentration of nutrients in seawater. Coralline algae will dominate in areas with moderate or strong grazing of noncalcified algae, strong wave effects, and moderate or high concentration of nutrients. Communities of algal turf develop under low concentration of mineral nutrients and low-level grazing. The beds of large fleshy and foliaceous (frondose) macrophytes occupy ecological niches that are rich in nutrients and free of pressure from herbivorous animals (Littler and Littler, 1984).",

The communities of large calcified green algae (the genera Halimeda and Udotea) and red algae (the genera Amphiroa and Galaxaura) also produce calcium carbonate. The remnants of thalluses from these algae transform into carbonate sands, which fill up gaps between coral colonies on the bottom and serve as building materials for coral reefs (Fig. 2.30 ). For example, algae of the genus Halimeda provide up to 40% (by volume) of the carbonate sand on the Belizean Barrier Reef in the Caribbean (Macintyre et al., 1987) . They accumulate calcium carbonate (in the form of aragonite) at a rate of approximately 2 kg CaCO 3 /m 2 per year (Merceron et al., 2007; Nelson, 2009) ; their contribution to the building of reef carbonate bases is about 8% (Hillis, 1997).",

Some species of coralline algae possess chemical substances and facilitate the settlement and metamorphosis of the larvae of some coral species. Coralline algae are utilized by marine farms specializing in growing abalone (Haliotis spp.), and service as a substrate for settlement and development of abalone larvae (Morse and Morse, 1991).",

Furthermore, the cultivation of shrimp in coastal areas is also very damaging, especially for coral-reef communities. The pollution of coastal waters by organic remnants from these plantations and farms leads to rapid growth of marine algae that supersede corals from these communities. Gathering of calcareous coralline algal nodules and dredging or dynamite blasting of sizable reef blocks (e.g., landfill), which are used as mortar or for liming acidic tropical soils, have obvious detrimental effects. Many of the world's reefs have already been exposed to different degrees of sewage pollution and oil spills. In addition, spear fishing and fishing trapping have been so intensive that the larger reef fishes have almost disappeared in many of the heavily populated regions.

At room temperature, alginate solutions (\u0440\u041d from 5.5 to 10) can maintain their properties for a long time. The most stable alginate is sodium alginate, and the less stable is alginic acid. Large amounts of sodium alginate, calcium alginate, potassium alginate, and ammonium alginate are produced today. Alginates, like zinc alginate, copper alginate, sodium calcium alginate, ammonium calcium, and propylene glycol alginate, are produced for special purposes. The food industry uses about 30% of produced alginates every year, the textile industry takes 50%, and the medical, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries utilize 20%.",

In nature, abalone larvae settle on coralline algae, while on farms, the green alga Ulvella lens are cultivated locally for the larvae to grow on (Daume, 2006) . Young mollusks develop from larvae and eat this alga. Adult abalones on most farms are fed by macroalgae, which are collected or cultivated nearby.

About 90% of agar is used for food and only 10% is used for industrial purposes. For example, bakery bread, ice cream, meringue, fruit puddings, jams and marmalade all use agar in the production processes.Agar has no taste and smell and is often added to food together with other ingredients. In Asian countries, jellies made from agar and natural fruit juices are very popular.Agar is also used for preparation of canned meat and fish products. Since agar cannot be digested in the gastrointestinal tract, it is often used in low-calorie dishes (Arasaki and Arasaki, 1983) .In agricultural industry, agar is used as a neutral carrier for nutrients and growth substances. Seedling germination of herbaceous plants from meristematic tissue uses agar as nutrient substances (Armis\u00e9n and Galatas, 1987) .Bacteriological agar is widely used in medical biotechnological and research projects, e.g., bacteria culture and testing, tissue culture, cell assays, etc.",

Plasma copper, iron, selenium, and zinc concentrations are severely depressed for prolonged periods and urinary excretion of selenium and zinc is increased. These authors concluded that patients with major burns suffer acute trace element deficiencies. Using the balance study technique, our team showed that part of this deficiency is related to large exudative losses through the burned areas (9, 10) . During the first week after injury, patients with burns covering 30% of their body surfaces lose 20-40% of their body copper content and 10% of their selenium and zinc contents. The large urinary copper, selenium, and zinc losses that occur for many weeks are much smaller than the cutaneous losses.",

The combined alterations resulting from increased trace element losses and malnutrition are likely to induce some of the immune changes observed after burns. Indeed, in a previous open study in which early trace element supplements were used, our team showed that specific trace element supplements were associated with earlier normalization of serum concentrations, increased leukocyte counts, and shorter hospital stays (12) . The present trial studied trace element metabolism, immune defense, and clinical evolution in severely burned patients receiving identical early enteral nutritional support and then either the usually recommended parenteral trace element supplies or additional large supplements.",

There is no specific recommendation in the literature regarding trace element supplementation. It is established that trace elements play a key role in a series of metabolic and immune pathways. Many authors described alterations of trace element metabolism in burns, such as low serum concentrations and increased urinary excretion (8) . More recently, our group showed large cutaneous losses leading to acute deficiency states (9, 10). The mean cumulate losses during the first week postinjury were close to 33 mg for copper (520 mol), 2.5 mg for selenium (32 mol), and 190 mg for zinc (2910 mol). This constitutes extensive losses approaching 20-40% of body content for copper and 10% of body content for selenium and zinc. In a subsequent nonrandomized supplementation trial, the supplements were calculated to substitute for the cutaneous losses (12) . The results showed clinical evidence of beneficial effects of early trace element supplements on wound healing (better graft take), immune response with higher leukocyte counts between days 7 and 12 postinjury, and reduced hospital stays. The present investigation provides further evidence of the role of specific and separate trace element supplements in such patients, because the changes observed in the intervention group could not be due to global nutrition problems in the control group because both groups were managed identically. Early enteral nutrition was provided to all patients, and energy and protein intakes were similar in both groups. The study confirms that trace element supplements achieve a pharmacologic effect, with earlier normalization of plasma selenium and zinc concentrations, as we suggested previously (12) , the changes being most visible for selenium ( Figure 1) . A trend toward higher leukocyte counts persisted. Moreover, the trace element supplements resulted in a significant decrease in the number of bronchopneumonia infections, an important clinical benefit after major burns.",

Selenium is involved in one of the main antioxidant defense systems of the body with the glutathione peroxidase family; selenium deficiency reduces neutrophil phagocytosis (23) and favors emergence of virulent viruses (24) . Deficiency of any of these elements, but especially of selenium and zinc, reduces resistance to several microorganisms and increases rates infection from bacteria, fungi, parasites (5) , and viruses (24, 25) . Supplementation of populations with either borderline status or well-established deficiencies is associated with improved immune defense and reduction of infection rates.

The most severe burns were included in the TE group (2 patients with burns covering 80% and 87% of body surface area and the most severe inhalation injury).

This could be explained by the fact that the difference in cumulate trace element intakes between groups was smaller in this study than in our previous study (12) , which was due to the systematic prescription of standard supplements (1 vial of Addamel N daily) to all patients from admission onward. Length of treatment may also have been too short; the persistent low plasma trace element concentrations support the view that supplementation could have been continued beyond day 8. Nevertheless, the supplementation was associated with a trend toward higher total leukocyte and neutrophil counts during the second week after injury compared with control subjects; this finding agrees with our first supplementation trial, although the differences between groups are less significant. However, there was no obvious effect of the supplements on cell-mediated immunity. T cell alterations were described in burns (2, 28, 29) , and T cell responses to mitogen were markedly depressed in both groups, although this was not improved by the trace element supplements. Taken together, the data suggest that trace element supplements directly affect neutrophil function and peripheral neutrophil counts, possibly through associations with changes in neutrophil trafficking. Because T cell proliferation in response to mitogens was unchanged, the significant reduction in number of infections is consistent with the main effect of trace elements being on the nonspecific immune defenses mediated by the neutrophils, with a protective effect against bacterial aggression.",

                "text": "Burn patients are characterized by an intense inflammatory response, and IL-6 is massively increased after burns (30), peaking during the first day after injury as observed in our control group. The peak IL-6 concentrations were lower in the trace element-supplemented patients, possibly as a result of a blunting of the inflammatory response. This finding is strengthened by the observation of subsequent lower peak CRP concentrations, suggesting an effect of very early trace element provision on the inflammatory cascade. In this context, it is of interest that selenium, through the glutathione peroxidases, is involved in the down-regulation of the nuclear transcription factor B, which is a key to the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 (31). Usually, during an acute phase response, plasma selenium concentration decreases, probably in response to cytokine production. Critically ill patients are characterized by low plasma selenium concentrations and increased urinary excretion (32), the changes being even more marked in trauma patients (33) and after burn injury (6, 9) . Free radical production is increased in many critical illnesses, and selenium is part of the endogenous antioxidant defense mechanism as a constituent of the glutathione peroxidase family. In animals with reperfusion injuries, which are characterized by an increased free radical load, antioxidant status has been successfully reinforced with selenium supplements (34) . Burn injury is also characterized by a steep and prolonged increase of free radical production (35) , and administration of antioxidants has been attempted. Selenium supplementation appears logical when considering the acute deficiency and the associated glutathione peroxidase dysfunction. Selenium plasma concentrations were maintained within normal ranges in the trace element-supplemented patients. The effect of this change on glutathione peroxidase activity remains to be determined.",

A better understanding of the effects of trace elements on neutrophil function and the acute phase response is warranted in future studies. We realize that the study of neutrophil chemotaxis, immune cell phenotyping, and PBMC modification assays are gross approaches to the study of the alterations in immunity of burned patients. Trace element supplementation may modulate immunity by subtle modifications of cell physiology such as respiratory burst or cell signaling. This will require more complex biochemical studies of neutrophil and T cell function, which are already in progress in our laboratory.",

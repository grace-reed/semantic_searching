                "text": "Tropical waters are oligotrophic and therefore known as 'deserts' of the sea, but some marine invertebrates such as scleractinian corals and giant clams can flourish in such oligotrophic environment. Specifically, giant clams (Genus: Tridacna or Hippopus) are inhabitants of the Indo-Pacific reef ecosystems. They can grow rapidly despite the shortage of nutrients and are the largest of all bivalves because they live in mutualistic association with Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellates of genera Symbiodinium, Cladocopium, Durusdinium and Gerakladium (Hernawan, 2008; Weber, 2009; DeBoer et al., 2012; Ikeda et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2019; Pochon et al., 2019; Guibert et al., 2020) . In giant clams, symbiotic dinoflagellates reside extracellularly in a branched tubular system that originates from the host's digestive tract (Norton et al., 1992) . The tertiary tubules containing the majority of symbionts are located predominantly in the colorful and extensible outer mantle that contains pigments and iridophores (Norton et al., 1992) . As the symbionts have no access to the ambient seawater, the host needs to supply them with nutrients such as inorganic carbon (C i ), nitrogen, and phosphorus. During illumination, photosynthesizing dinoflagellates donate as much as 95% of the photosynthates to the clam host in order to fulfil its energy and nutrition requirements (Klumpp and Griffiths, 1994) . As a result, the host can maintain high growth rate and conduct light-enhanced shell formation in nutrient poor tropical waters (Ip et al., 2017; Rossbach et al., 2019) . Unlike non-symbiotic bivalve mollusks, shell formation in giant clams is enhanced by light because the growth rate of the host is the highest while receiving organic nutrients from its photosynthesizing symbionts.",

                "text": "Light-enhanced shell formation involves the increased deposition of CaCO 3 (Ca 2+ + HCO 3 \u2212 \u21d4 CaCO 3 + H + ) from the extrapallial fluid onto the inside surface of the shell valve during illumination. Hence, giant clams need to increase the uptake of Ca 2+ from the external seawater during illumination to support light-enhanced shell formation, and there are indications that Ca 2+ uptake occurs through the ctenidium (Cao-Pham et al., 2019) . Each giant clam consists of two ctenidia and each ctenidium comprises two demibranches. The ctenidium is comb-shaped, and consists of many protruding filaments and numerous internal tertiary water channels. Together, the filaments and water channels increase the surface area of the ctenidium tremendously so that it can function effectively in many physiological processes, including gaseous exchange, nutrient uptake, waste excretion and acid-base balance. The ctenidium of the fluted giant clam, Tridacna squamosa, participates in many light-enhanced processes (Ip et al., 2015; . It takes part in the absorption of Ca 2+ (voltage-gated calcium channel subunit alpha 1, CACNA1; Cao-Pham et al., 2019), C i (dual domain carbonic anhydrase; Koh et al., 2018) , urea (urea active transporter or DUR3; Chan et al., 2018) , glucose (sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 or SGLT1; Chan et al., 2019) , NO 3 \u2212 (H + :2NO 3 \u2212 cotransporter or SIALIN; Ip et al., 2020) , and inorganic phosphate (sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2a or NPT2a; Chan et al., 2020a ; sodium-dependent phosphate transporter protein 1; . It is involved in the assimilation of ammonia (glutamine synthetase; Hiong et al., 2017a) and the excretion of H + (Na + /H + exchanger 3 or NHE3; Hiong et al., 2017b ; vacuolar-type H + -ATPase subunit A; Ip et al., 2018) . It can also participate in light-suppressed ammonia excretion (ammonium transporter 1; Boo et al., 2018) . Notably, the gene and/or protein expression levels of the above-mentioned transporters and enzymes are lightdependent in the ctenidium of T. squamosa. Concerning Ca 2+ absorption, the ctenidium of T. squamosa expresses a homolog of CACNA1, which is the pore-forming subunit of the L-type voltage-gated Ca 2+ channel (VGCC). CACNA1 is localized in the apical membrane of epithelial cells covering the filaments or lining the tertiary water channels (Cao-Pham et al., 2019) . The protein abundance of CACNA1 increases significantly in the ctenidium of T. squamosa during light exposure to augment exogenous Ca 2+ uptake. In addition, the ctenidium of T. squamosa expresses a homolog of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA-like), and illumination also significantly enhances its protein expression level (Chan et al., 2020b) . Hence, the Ca 2+ absorbed through VGCC into the ctenidial epithelial cells can be sequestered by SERCA-like into the endoplasmic reticulum and traverse the cell interior without perturbing cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] homeostasis. As the free [Ca 2+ ] in the cytosol is about 10,000-fold lower than that (2.1-2.6 mM) in the extracellular fluid (Gilad et al., 2013; Carafoli and Krebs, 2016) , Ca 2+ cannot exit cells passively by diffusion and must be actively transported across the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells into the hemolymph against a large [Ca 2+ ] gradient. To date, the identity of this active Ca 2+ transporter in the basolateral membrane of the ctenidium of T. squamosa remains elusive.",

PMCA has a high Ca 2+ affinity but low Ca 2+ transport capacity, and it may have a housekeeping role in maintaining cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] (Brini and Carafoli, 2011) . In comparison, NCX may play a dynamic role of counteracting large potential variations in cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] as it has low Ca 2+ affinity for Ca 2+ but high capacity for its transport (Brini and Carafoli, 2011) . Consequently, PMCA represents only a minute portion of proteins (<0.1%) in the plasma membrane (Brini and Carafoli, 2011) . NCX typically transports one Ca 2+ out of the cell in exchange for the import of three Na + ions. It can operate in a bidirectional fashion, depending on the electrochemical gradients of Ca 2+ and Na + . There are three isoforms of NCX (NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3; Philipson et al., 1988; Nicoll et al., 1996) . They can have specialized physiological functions, which include calcification in osteoblast (Stains and Gay, 1998; Akisaka et al., 1988; Sosnoski and Gay, 2008) and ameloblast (Okumura et al., 2010) , transepithelial Ca 2+ transport across kidney and intestine, Ca 2+ removal from lens, muscle contractility, and neurotransmitter release (Blaustein and Lederer, 1999; Hoenderop et al., 2005) .",

Then, an anti-NCX1 polyclonal antibody was custommade for the localization of NCX1 in the ctenidium by immunofluorescence microscopy. The hypothesis tested was that NCX1 would have a basal localization in the ctenidial epithelial cells. In addition, the transcript level and protein abundance of NCX1/NCX1 were determined by quantitative real time-PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting, respectively, to test the hypothesis that they could be upregulated in the ctenidium of individuals exposed to light as compared with those exposed to darkness. If occurred, the active extrusion of Ca 2+ through NCX1 driven by the influx of Na + down its electrochemical potential gradient would increase the intracellular [Na + ]. As the intracellular Na + homeostasis is known to be maintained by Na + /K + -ATPase (NKA; Blanco and Mercer, 1998) , efforts were made to determine whether illumination would also affect the expression level of NKA \u03b1-subunit (NKA\u03b1) in the ctenidium of T. squamosa. NKA comprises three types of subunits (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3), and each subunit has its isoforms. There are at least one \u03b1and one \u03b2-subunit in a functional NKA (Jorgensen et al., 2003) , with NKA\u03b1 (110-120 kDa) containing the ATP binding site and the catalytic domains for the binding and transporting of Na + and K + (Blanco and Mercer, 1998) . Preliminary results obtained in this study revealed that the NKA\u03b1 amino acid sequence obtained from the ctenidium of T. squamosa was identical to that obtained from the inner mantle as reported by Boo et al. (2017) . Hence, we adopted the qPCR primer set and the anti-NKA\u03b1 antibody designed by Boo et al. (2017) based on NKA\u03b1 of the inner mantle to determine the transcript and protein expression levels of NKA\u03b1/NKA\u03b1 in the ctenidium of individuals of T. squamosa exposed to light or darkness. The anti-NKA\u03b1 antibody was also used to determine the subcellular localization of NKA\u03b1 in the ctenidium by immunofluorescence microscopy. It was hypothesized that NKA\u03b1 had a basolateral localization and its expression level would be upregulated in the ctenidium during light exposure. Results obtained were expected to provide a deeper understanding on the molecular mechanisms involved in light-enhanced Ca 2+ absorption through the gills of T. squamosa apropos of light-enhanced shell formation.",

(2020b) , the pGEM-T Easy vector system (Promega Corporation) was used to clone and transform the extracted PCR product into JM109 Escherichia coli competent cells. Multiple clones were sequenced to obtain partial NCX1-like fragments. The sequences were analysed by using BioEdit version 7.2.5. BlastN (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) was used to confirm the identity of the sequences obtained. Analysis of multiple sequences revealed the absence of isoforms. Subsequently, the full coding sequence of NCX1-like was obtained by performing 5 \u2032 and 3' RACE (SMARTer\u2122 RACE cDNA amplification kit: Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA) PCR with specific RACE primers (Forward: 5 \u2032 -CCTACCTGTTCAAGGA-GAGCTGTGG-3 \u2032 and Reverse: 5 \u2032 -ATCGGCAATGTATGCAATGA-CAACCATGGCT-3 \u2032 ). To prepare samples for sequencing, the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was used in combination with ethanol/sodium acetate precipitation. Sequencing was performed using a 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The complete coding cDNA sequence of NCX1-like sequence was deposited into GenBank (accession number MW353260).",

Using the basolateral membrane fraction (membrane vesicles) isolated from the posterior gills of shore crabs (Carcinus maenas), it has been demonstrated that significantly more Ca 2+ is accumulated in the K + -loaded vesicles as compared to that in Na + -loaded vesicles, suggesting the presence a Na +gradient-driven Ca 2+ extrusion mechanism (Flik et al., 1994) . In addition, the activity of NKA increases significantly in the gills of blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) during postmolt period (Towle and Mangum, 1985) . Taken together, it can be deduced that the gill epithelial cells of aquatic crustaceans consist of a basolateral NCX, which employs the energy derived from the Na + gradient established by NKA to support the active extrusion of the Ca 2+ absorbed from the external medium into the hemolymph (Flik et al., 1994) .

A XIP domain is present at the N-terminal end of the intracellular loop with inherent Na + inactivation properties (Matsuoka et al., 1997) . In addition, NCX1-like obtained from T. squamosa also contains two conserved internal repeat sequences (\u03b11 and \u03b12 repeats). These two internal repeats contribute to the formation of translocation pathway for Ca 2+ , while the \u03b11 repeat loop plays an important role in ion selection.

Hence, there must be a concurrent increase in the operation of a transporter, which can actively pump Na + out of the cell. NKA is essential for maintaining the Na + and K + gradients across the plasma membrane of animal cells, and these gradients in turn support the secondary active transport of certain ions/molecules (Blanco and Mercer, 1998) . Indeed, the ctenidium of T. squamosa expressed NKA\u03b1, which had an amino acid sequence identical to that expressed in the inner mantle (Boo et al., 2017) and a basolateral localization (Fig. 11) . Furthermore, illumination led to significant increases in the transcript level and protein abundance of NKA\u03b1/NKA\u03b1 in the ctenidium of T. squamosa. This aligned well with the upregulation of the expression of NCX1-like to achieve light-enhanced transepithelial Ca 2+ absorption. Besides NCX1-like, the Na + gradient generated by NKA can also drive three other Na + -dependent light-enhanced physiological processes that occur in the ctenidial epithelial cells of T. squamosa (Fig. 11) . These are (1) the active excretion of H + in exchange for Na + through NHE3-like (Hiong et al., 2017a) , (2) the active absorption of glucose or urea through SGLT1-like (Chan et al., 2019) , and (3) the active absorption of inorganic phosphate through NPT2a-like (Chan et al., 2020b) , which are localized in the apical membrane. In turn, the transmembrane H + gradient generated by NHE3-like across the apical membrane can be used to drive the active uptake of exogenous urea through DUR3 (Chan et al., 2018) and nitrate through SIALIN (Ip et al., 2020) in the ctenidium of T. squamosa.

In ameloblasts, both NCX1 and NCX3 are localized in the apical membrane, and they work cooperatively to actively extrude Ca 2+ for enamel formation (Okumura et al., 2010) . In osteoblasts that take part in bone formation, NCX3 is facing the mineralizing bone surface and acts as the primary Ca 2+ extrusion mechanism (Stains et al., 2002; Sosnoski and Gay, 2008) , whereas NCX1 is only weakly expressed and its subcellular localization could not be identified even by using specific NCX1 antibodies (Stains et al., 2002) . In the scleractinian coral, Acropora yongei, a form of NCX (AyNCX A ) has been localized in the intracellular vesicles of calicoblastic cells (Barron et al., 2018) . In addition, amorphous CaCO 3 can be found inside coral cells. Hence, skeleton formation in scleractinian corals may involve in the deposition of CaCO 3 inside the calicoblastic cells, instead of the translocation of Ca 2+ from the calicoblastic cells into the subcalicoblastic fluid where calcification occurs (Mass et al., 2017) .",

As a consequent, there must be an increase in the absorption of exogenous Ca 2+ through the ctenidium, which involves the increased translocation of Ca 2+ from the ctenidial epithelial cells to the hemolymph through their basolateral NCX1-like ( Fig. 11; this study) . Taken together, light-enhanced shell formation in T. squamosa requires the cooperation of two NCX isoforms located in two remotely separated organs that are connected through the hemolymph. The operation of these two NCXs requires the support of NKA, the operation of which needs a supply of ATP. Therefore, light-enhanced Ca 2+ absorption through the ctenidium and light-enhanced shell formation that involves the shell-facing epithelium of the inner mantle must be supported ultimately by the symbiotic dinoflagellates located in the colorful outer mantle, which can conduct photosynthesis with enhanced expression level type II Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase of during illumination (Poo et al., 2020) . The release of O 2 and photosynthates by photosynthesizing symbionts in the outer mantle may promote the host's aerobic energy metabolism and augment ATP formation in the ctenidium and the inner mantle to support the operation of the primary pumps like NKA (Boo et al., 2017) and PMCA (Ip et al., 2017) . Therefore, efforts should be made in the future to examine the effects of anthropogenic stressors, including elevated ocean temperature and lowered Fig. 11 . A proposed scheme on the involvement of a homolog of Na + /Ca 2+ -exchanger 1 (NCX1-like) in the transport of Ca 2+ across the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells of the ctenidium in Tridacna squamosa. Ca 2+ from seawater could be transported into the epithelial cells of the ctenidium through the apical voltagegated Ca 2+ channel (VGCC; Cao-Pham et al., 2019). Subsequently, the basolateral NCX1-like could participate in the extrusion of Ca 2+ to the hemolymph, and eventually circulated to the inner mantle which is in direct contact with the site of shell formation (extrapallial fluid). As the increased operation of NCX1-like would lead to an increase of Na + influx, the participation of the basolateral Na + /K + -ATPase (NKA) is required to maintain the Na + gradient across the plasma membrane. The expression levels of NCX1-like and NKA (specifically NKA\u03b1) can be upregulated by illumination. Besides NCX1-like, the electrochemical gradient of Na + generated by NKA can also drive three other Na + -dependent light-enhanced physiological processes that occur across the apical membrane of the ctenidial epithelial cells. These processes are (1) the active excretion of H + in exchange for Na + through a homolog of Na + /H + exchanger 3 (NHE3; Hiong et al., 2017b), (2) the active absorption of glucose or urea through a homolog of sodium:glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1, Chan et al., 2019) , and (3) the active absorption of inorganic phosphate through a homolog of sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2a (NPT2a; Chan et al., 2020b). seawater pH, not only on symbiotic dinoflagellates but also on the host's mechanisms participating in light-enhanced shell formation, such as NCX1, NCX3, NKA and PMCA.",

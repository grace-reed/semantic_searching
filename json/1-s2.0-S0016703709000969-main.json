This information is important in not only determining the response of the surface oceans to ocean acidification from enhanced uptake of CO , but also to better understand the effects of ocean acidification on carbonate secreting organisms such as corals, whose ability to calcify is highly pH dependent. Here we report an $200 year d 11 B isotopic record, extracted from a long-lived Porites coral from the central Great Barrier Reef of Australia. This record covering the period from 1800 to 2004 was sampled at yearly increments from 1940 to the present and 5-year increments prior to 1940. The d 11 B isotopic compositions reflect variations in seawater pH, and the d 13 C changes in the carbon composition of surface water due to fossil fuel burning over this period. In addition complementary Ba/Ca, d 18 O and Mg/Ca data was obtained providing proxies for terrestrial runoff, salinity and temperature changes over the past 200 years in this region. Positive thermal ionization mass spectrometry (PTIMS) method was utilized in order to enable the highest precision and most accurate measurements of d 11 B values. The internal precision and reproducibility for d 11 B of our measurements are better than \u00b10.2& (2r), which translates to a precision of better than \u00b10.02 pH units. Our results indicate that the long-term pre-industrial variation of seawater pH in this region is partially related to the decadalinterdecadal variability of atmospheric and oceanic anomalies in the Pacific. In the periods around 1940 and 1998 there are also rapid oscillations in d 11 B compositions equivalent changes in pH of almost 0.5 U. The 1998 oscillation is co-incident with a major coral bleaching event indicating the sensitivity of skeletal d 11 B compositions to loss of zooxanthellate symbionts. Importantly, from the 1940s to the present-day, there is a general overall trend of ocean acidification with pH decreasing by about 0.2-0.3 U, the range being dependent on the value assumed for the fractionation factor a (B3-B4) of the boric acid and borate species in seawater. Correlations of d 11 B with d 13 C during this interval indicate that the increasing trend towards ocean acidification over the past 60 years in this region is the result of enhanced dissolution of CO 2 in surface waters from the rapidly increasing levels of atmospheric CO 2 , mainly from fossil fuel burning. This suggests that the increased levels of anthropogenic CO 2 in atmosphere has already caused a significant trend towards acidification in the oceans during the past decades. Observations of surprisingly large decreases in pH across important carbonate producing regions, such as the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, raise serious concerns about the impact of Greenhouse gas emissions on coral calcification.",

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j. gca.2009.02.009 ecosystems on a global scale. Atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are approaching 390 ppm, far beyond the 'natural' range of 200-280 ppm present during the past 400 kyr of glacial/interglacial cycles, and are continuing to increase at an accelerating rate of >2 ppm/yr. About 30-40 percent of the CO 2 injected into the atmosphere over the last century has been taken-up by the oceans (Orr et al., 2001) , with a resultant increase in the hydrogen ion concentration [H + ] of seawater, causing a reduction in seawater pH and trend towards ocean acidification (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003) . Model calculations indicate that the increased levels of atmospheric CO 2 relative to the pre-industrial era has already caused an overall decrease of global seawater pH of 0.1 U, and further pH reduction of 0.2-0.3 are predicted for the next century (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003; Haugan and Drange, 1996) as discussed in the Fourth Assessment Report of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007) . Ocean acidification will reduce the level of carbonate saturation in seawater (Feely et al., 2004; Morse et al., 2006; Orr et al., 2005) and lead to reductions in rates of calcification (e.g. Langdon and Atkinson, 2005) . If ocean acidification continues on its present trajectory, CaCO 3 dissolution will become more serious, as aragonite unsaturation is approached. As a result, some key marine calcareous organisms, such as calcareous micro-organisms and corals, will have difficulty to maintain their external carbonate skeletons (Kleypas et al., 1999; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Miles et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2006) . In particular, coral reefs will be at great risk as coral calcification appears to be extremely sensitive to the level of carbonate saturation (Langdon and Atkinson, 2005) .",

Our current knowledge of ocean acidification is mainly the result of model calculations (Kleypas et al., 1999; Cao and Caldeira, 2008) and unlike other key climatic indices, such as temperature and salinity, until recently, seawater pH has seldom been recorded in marine observations due to the non-routine nature of the measurements. Accordingly, long-term continuous seawater pH records are scarce, with records now only approaching several decades from the offshore sites of Hawaii (Hawaii Ocean Time-series: HOT, see http://hahana. soest.hawaii.edu/hot/hot_jgofs.html) and Bermuda (Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study: BATS, see http://bats.bios.edu/). This raises questions of how regional controls on seawater pH operate and what processes influence the variation of seawater pH over decadal to centennial time-scales. This lack of knowledge hinders attempts to properly evaluate not only the current status of ocean acidification, but importantly future trends and likely impacts on marine biota.",

Some studies, however, argued that some observed high B/ 10 B ratios in corals might indicate partial incorporation of B(OH) 3 into coral skeletons, potentially compromising the utility of coral boron isotopes as a seawater pH indicator (Xiao et al., 2006) . Taking account of the calcification mechanism in corals at the cellular scale (Gattuso et al., 1999) , the boron isotopic composition of coral skeletons reflect those of the internal fluid called extracytoplasmic calcifying fluid (ECF), which underlies the calicoblastic epithelium, or lowest tissue layer of the coral polyp cells where calcification takes place . The ECF is separated from the ambient seawater by the coral polyp cells. It is generally postulated that Ca-ATPase enzymes work to transport protons, generated during calcification, away from the ECF to maintain high pH and transplant Ca 2+ to the site of calcification at the same time for calcification (Al-Horani et al., 2003a; Gattuso et al., 1999; McConnaughey and Whelan, 1997) . The on-going process of H + generation and removal results in larger pH variation in the ECF compared to that in ambient seawater (Al-Horani et al., 2003a; Hemming et al., 1998; Kuhl et al., 1995) . Moreover, very little is known about the mechanism for boron transportation to the ECF from ambient seawater. Which species, B(OH) 3 or B(HO) 4",

                "text": "Most of the studies of boron isotope systematics in carbonates have focused on reconstructing paleoseawater pH in longer time-scales, such as glacial/interglacial cycles (10 5 years) or longer (10 6 years) through the early Cenozoic Honisch and Hemming, 2005; Pearson and Palmer, 1999; Sanyal et al., 1997; Sanyal et al., 1995) , in which the pH records are used to infer levels of atmospheric pCO 2 . To date very few studies have focused on the recent decadal to centennial pH record, which is the appropriate timescale for studying the effects of ocean acidification driven by anthropogenic emissions of CO . An exception is a pH record covering the past 300 years produced by the ANU laboratories at 5-yearly resolution using boron isotopic variations in a Porites coral from Flinders Reef in the Coral Sea, offshore of the East Australia (Pelejero et al., 2005) . It is interesting to note that the variation of seawater pH in this region is mainly in response to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) of ocean-atmosphere anomalies, with an $50-year cycle in the past 300 years (Pelejero et al., 2005) . However, due to these oscillations there is no convincing evidence for a decrease in pH that can be unambiguously attributed to ocean acidification. This maybe due to the coral record ceasing in the mid 1980s, combined with the relatively large IPO oscillations. This indicates the importance of natural variability in seawater pH and that higher atmospheric CO concentration will not necessarily result in a uniform reduction in seawater pH (Haugan and Drange, 1996) . It is therefore apparent that the response of seawater pH to atmospheric CO 2 concentration is not a simple process, particularly in coral reef environments where coral calcification and photosynthesis can significantly perturb local pH. As recognized in the earlier study of Pelejero et al. (2005) more paleo-pH records covering the past several centuries at different locations and sufficient resolution are needed for a better understanding of how larger-scale ocean variations may interact with locally generated changes in pH produced within coral reef environments.",

The sample was eluted with 2 mL (0.5 mL \u00c2 4) 0.1 N HCl and collected for further boron purification. The first column process removes the dominant Ca fraction that may form Ca(OH) 2 precipitates causing significant boron losses when increasing the pH during the subsequent step.

After allowing $1 h for equilibrium, the solution was loaded onto the second B specific column, consisting of $0.5 mL Amberlite IRA 743 resin in a 2 mL BioSpin column.

Measurements for each sample consisted of four blocks, with each block containing 20-25 cycles.

The isobaric 308 Cs 2 CNO + interference is presumed to be from coral derived organic material despite the coral samples being treated with H O 2 before column chemistry. Some organic material apparently remains with the anomalously low 309/308 ratios attributed to 308 Cs 2 CNO + interference. Because organic matter is exhausted more quickly than Cs BO 2 + , during measurement, a gradual decreasing of 308 Cs 2 CNO + isobaric interference, produces an increase in 309/308 ratio. Interference free 309/308 data is therefore obtained from the plateau region shown in Fig. 3a , which occurs after the organic matters has decayed. Thus careful monitoring of interferences is essential for accurate 11 B/ 10 B ratios. Some studies suggest the addition of H PO 4 to the sample during filament loading (Wei et al., 2004) . H 3 PO 4 may retard the ionization of Cs 2 BO 2 + , and help to exhaust organic interferences before data collection. However, the decay rate of Cs BO 2 + signal increases at higher temperature and as a result, the Cs BO 2 + signal generally cannot be sustained to obtain high-precision results necessary for this study.",

Such interdecadal fluctuations have also been observed in another coral d 11 B record in Flinders Reef in the adjacent region (Pelejero et al., 2005) , which is the only other published long-term coral d 11 B record and also shows a relationship to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) of ocean-atmosphere anomalies (Pelejero et al., 2005) . The temporal variations of both coral d 11 B records, as well as the filtered IPO index, represented by the temperature anomalies during January-February-March (Folland et al., 1999; Power et al., 1999) are shown in Fig. 5 . The coral d 11 B in Flinders Reef vary from 22.99& to 24.89&, which is within the variation range for those in Arlington Reef, but the maximum fluctuation amplitude in the Flinders Reef record is only about half of that in the Arlington Reef record (Fig. 5) . Even though not exactly in phase, the interdecadal fluctuations in the two coral d 11 B records appear to be partially related to the variation of the IPO index, in particular the rapid variations of coral d 11 B correspond to rapid IPO changes. For example, the rapid increase of d 11 B values around 1940 in the Arlington Reef record, approximately corresponds to the rapid shifting of the IPO index from its maximum positive value ($1.7) in 1940 to its maximum negative value ($\u00c01.7) in 1951 ( Fig. 5) . It is noted, however, that there are also some inconsistencies with the IPO, in particular the high d 11 B values from 1993 to 1995 followed by the rapid fall in values centered at 1998, suggesting that other factors are also at play.",

                "text": "The interdecadal fluctuation of these coral d 11 B records from the Great Barrier Reef is further illustrated by their power spectra (Fig. 6 ), which were calculated using the software of REDFIT (Schulz and Mudelsee, 2002) . A robust 48-year cycle is present in the Flinders Reef pH spectrum (Fig. 6a) , and a robust 22-and 10-year cycles, which are significant at the 95% confident level, and a weak 50-year cycle, which is significant at the 80% confident level, are present in the Arlington Reef pH spectrum (Fig. 6b) . These decadal-interdecadal cycles are the characteristic periodicities for the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) of Pacific climate variability (Mantua and Hare, 2002) or IPO (Folland et al., 1999; Power et al., 1999) , and they are well represented in coral paleoclimate records covering the past several centuries in the Pacific and adjacent regions (Cobb et al., 2001; Linsley et al., 2000a; Linsley et al., 2000b; Sun et al., 2004) . The difference of the periodicities shown by the two pH records may in part be attributed to the difference in age range and temporal resolution. The Flinders Reef record has longer time span, $300 years, but lower time resolution, in 5-year interval, while the Arlington Reef record covers a shorter time span from 1800 to 2004, but at higher resolution (1-year intervals) from 1940 to 2004. Therefore, the lower frequency ($50-year) is readily apparent in the Flinders Reef record, whereas the higher frequencies (22-year and 10-year) are more apparent in the Arlington Reef record. Even though the periodicities represented are different, they may still be related to the PDO or IPO, indicating that the long-term variation of seawater pH in the west Pacific may response to the decadal-interdecadal climate variability in the Pacific on centennial time scale. However, the specific mechanisms for the linkage Coral Records for Ocean Acifidication Table 2 The analyzed and calculated data of AREO 4 coral. Coral Records for Ocean Acifidication between the variations of coral d 11 B in the GBR and IPO index is unclear and as discussed below only partially accounts for the overall variability. In addition to the interdecadal fluctuations, there is an overall decreasing trend in the Arlington Reef d 11 B record, particularly after 1940, when d 11 B varies from $25& in 1947 to $21& in 2004. This trend is not readily apparent in the Flinders Reef as it does not cover the time interval after 1990. The overall trend of decreasing d B in the Arlington Reef record also corresponds to the more continuous trend to more negative of d 13 C values and the progressive increase of Mg/Ca ratios after 1940 ( Fig. 4) , where significant positive correlation, (coefficient of 0.62 with n = 64, p < 0.0001), exists between d 11 B and d 13 C, and significant negative correlation, (coefficient of \u00c00.60 with n = 64, p < 0.0001), occurs between d 11 B and Mg/Ca ratios (Fig. 7) . Coral Mg/Ca is very sensitive to temperature change with higher Mg/Ca in coral skeleton corresponding to higher sea surface temperatures (SST) (Mitsuguchi et al., 1996) . Even though biological/metabolic effect may influence Mg/Ca in coral skeleton (Mitsuguchi et al., 2003) , e pH values are calculated using the following parameters: a (B3-B4) = 1.0204 (Xiao et al., 2006) , pK B = 8.60 which hinder the utility of Mg/Ca to obtain precise SST records in old corals, the positive correlation between SST and Mg/Ca in modern corals is generally robust (Wei et al., 2000) . In our coral records from Arlington Reef as shown in Fig. 4 , the gradual increase of Mg/Ca since 1940 indicates continuously warming in this region, which agrees with the generally trend of global warming. The regional warming is also supported by the trend of more negative d 18 O values shown in Fig. 4 . On the other hand, even though metabolic CO 2 within the polyps is believed to play a significant role in calcification of coral skeleton, the contribution of the DIC from external seawater remains an important factor (Al-Horani et al., 2003a) . Thus, the long-term change of the coral d 13 C recorded in the Arlington coral is interpreted as reflecting the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the surface ocean. Therefore, the variation of coral d 11 B at Arlington Reef positively correlates with the on-going decrease of the d 13 C of DIC in seawater, and negatively correlates with the secular warming in this region after 1940.",

The mechanisms controlling the relationship between the pH in the ECF changes in ambient seawater pH remains uncertain, and clearly biological processes in coral polyps, such as photosynthesis and respiration, can obviously influence the ECF pH values (Al-Horani et al., 2003a) . Thus, while the role of biological or 'vital effects' on coral d 11 B compositions cannot be ignored, coral culturing experiments under controlled conditions indicate that the variations of the d 11 B in coral skeleton actively response to the pH changes in ambient seawater.

In this respect, the interdecadal fluctuation of the coral d 11 B records in the GBR may indicate a response of seawater pH changes to the IPO, and the significant trend of decreasing d 11 B values in the Arlington Reef record after 1940 is consistent with a secular trend towards ocean acidification or decreasing seawater pH in this region.",

Increasing SST decreases the solubility of CO 2 in seawater and may therefore partially mitigate the trend of decreasing pH. Furthermore for corals operating below their thermal optimum, increasing temperature may enhance the photosynthesis of the zooxanthella, and thereby increase the pH in the ECF for calcification (Al-Horani et al., 2003a) , as protons are consumed during photosynthesis (McConnaughey and Whelan, 1997) . Thus, by itself increasing SST would tend to favor higher d 11 B in coral skeleton rather than the observed trend of decreasing d 11 B values. However, the observed negative correlation between the coral pH and the increasing SST (higher Mg/Ca) indicates that since 1940 temperature effects have been more than offset by the secular decrease of seawater pH from rapidly rising atmospheric CO . This is consistent with the model calculations of Cao et al. (2007) who show that increasing SST from climate change produces only second-order modifications to the ocean carbonate chemistry, with the main driver being increased CO emissions.",

Increasing anthropogenic emissions thus not only increases levels of atmospheric CO 2 concentration but also decreases the d 13 C composition of the atmosphere.

Recognizing that the coral d 11 B records the pH in the ECF rather than that in the ambient seawater , the empirical relation between coral d 11 B and seawater pH may have offsets from the theoretical equation. The pK B ($8.6) and seawater d 11 B ($39.5&) have been experimentally determined and relatively well constrained particularly for recent samples . However, there is still considerable debate (Honisch et al., 2007) , particularly on the appropriate value of a (B3-B4) , (Klochko et al., 2006; Zeebe, 2005) and Pagani et al. (2005) challenges the utility of boron isotope as seawater pH proxy on longer time-scales. Currently, there are several possible a (B3-B4) values. The theoretically a (B3-B4), of $1.0194 calculated at 25\u00b0C, by (Kakihana et al., 1977) has generally been used in pH calculation Pelejero et al., 2005; Sanyal et al., 2001; Sanyal et al., 1996) . However, most recent improved theoretical calculations give a (B3-B4) values ranging from $1.020 to $1.030 at 25\u00b0C (Klochko et al., 2006; Zeebe, 2005) , with new experimental measurements suggesting an a (B3-B4) in seawater at 25\u00b0C of 1.0272 \u00b1 0.0006 (Klochko et al., 2006) . In a critical re-evaluation of the empirical data (Honisch et al., 2007) suggest that a (B3-B4) = 1.020 may best fit the empirical relationship between coral d 11 B and seawater pH. This value is similar to that suggested for Porites coral by Xiao et al. (2006) , of 1.0204. It is important to note that the use of different a (B3-B4) in calculating seawater pH from coral d 11 B, effects not only the absolute pH values but also has a second-order effect on the differential changes in pH. The calculation assumes pK B = 8.59 and seawater d 11 B = 39. 5&. 2342 G. Wei et al. / Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 73 (2009 ) 2332 -2346 In the absence of a detailed knowledge of how the physiological mechanisms of calcification and photosynthesis influence the boron isotopic composition of the carbonate skeleton , calibrating d 11 B in coral skeleton using in-situ measured seawater pH values remains a priority. Unfortunately as noted by other authors (Zeebe, 2005) this has been inhibited by the lack of continuous in-situ measured pH records within coral reefs.",

The d 11 B-coral record of seawater pH in Arlington Reef appears to have changed significantly in the past 200 years, with a decreasing trend in pH from 8.22 in 1947 to 7.66 in 2004. This suggests an increasing trend towards acidification of seawater in Arlington Reef particularly during the last 60 years. Regardless of the pH calibration used, our coral d 11 B record also indicates abrupt changes in seawater pH variation amplitude particularly during the late 1940s and late 1990s of up to $0.5 pH units. These rapid short-term oscillations are much larger than what can be attributed to regional changes in seawater pH, suggesting that other factors are influencing the coral d 11 B values as discussed in Section 4.3 below.",

With the increasing prevalence of acid soil runoff from disturbance of coastal mangrove systems the prevalence of low pH runoff in coastal regions has increased significantly (Lin and Melville, 1993; Sammut et al., 1996) . Although Arlington Reef is a typical outer mid-shelf reef, it is relatively close to the coast and occasionally subject to the influence of flood-plumes generated by the monsoonal dominated river runoff. Flood-plume impacts can be constrained by the combined use of Ba/Ca and d 18 O compositions. Riverine fluxes to the Great Barrier Reef are generally characterized by high Ba contents due to desorption of Ba from suspended terrestrial sediments, and hence high Ba/Ca ratios in corals generally indicates terrestrial (sediment) inputs (Alibert et al., 2003; McCulloch et al., 2003) . In addition the d 18 O composition of the river water is much lower than that of the seawater, and thus low salinity river flood-plumes are characterized by more negative d 18 O values in coral skeleton (McCulloch et al., 1994) . There are three large Ba/Ca peaks occurring in 1840, 1880 and in 1953, accompanied by significant negative d 18 O peaks (Fig. 4) . These are indicative of large river flood-plumes impacting to the central GBR during these periods. However, there is no d 11 B anomaly or significantly lower pH values associated with these events indicating that flood-plume activity has minimal effects on the pH of Arlington Reef. Also, the Ba/Ca variation shows no trend that is similar to that of the d 11 B after 1940. Therefore, terrestrial input to the GBR cannot account for the large decrease in reef water pH implied by the low d 11 B values.",

Recent experimental studies by (Al-Horani et al., 2003b) using micro-electrodes within the calcifying region (ie beneath the calicoblastic ectoderm) of the corals confirm that along with increasing the Ca ion concentration the pH is also increased. This increases the concentration of carbonate relative to bicarbonate ions and hence the degree of aragonite saturation, thereby promoting calcification. It is also likely that physiological processes associate with coral calcification will also modify the boron isotopic composition relative to that expected for the borate species in ambient seawater. Although the likely physiological control 1800 1820 1840 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 or 'vital effect' on the B isotopic composition is not well understood, higher internal pH required for coral calcification may provide an explanation for the difference between the empirically observed B fraction of 1.020 versus the higher value of 1.0276 given by from direct estimates of a (B3-B4).",

This is consistent with the observation in 1998 and in early 2002 of widespread coral bleaching in the GBR (Berkelmans et al., 2004) , due to exceptionally warm temperatures. It is suggested that this caused via a major reduction of the internal pH at the sites of coral calcification hence reducing the skeletal d 11 B values. Thus, in addition to registering external changes in reef water pH, the coral d 11 B values maybe highly sensitive indicators of coral bleaching. If correct this would imply that a major coral bleaching event also occurred during the 1940s when the d 11 B values registered a decrease in pH to 7.75.",

These records cover the time span from 1800 to 2004 at 1 to 5-year time resolution. They provide details of changes seawater pH over the past 200 years in this region, and provide strong constraints on the processes driving changes in surface seawater pH. The main points of this study are as follows: 1) Positive TIMS method was adopted in this study to provide high-precision measurements of boron isotopic composition of modern corals. The internal precision and reproducibility for d 11 B of our measurements are all better than \u00b10.2& (2r) , providing an equivalent precision for pH estimations of generally better than \u00b10.02. 2) The long-term variation of seawater pH derived from coral d 11 B record shows robust decadal-interdecadal cycles with periods of 22-year and 10-year over the past 200 years in this region. This suggests that the long-term seawater pH variation in this region is closely related to the decadal-interdecadal variability of atmospheric and oceanic anomalies in Pacific, which agrees with findings by Pelejero et al. (2005) . 3) Coupled with this long-term variation, a significant acidification trend occurs from 1940s to present, with pH decrease of about 0.2-0.4, estimating using different a (B3-B4) values. Comparisons with other paleoclimate proxies in particular d 13 C values, indicate that the trend towards ocean acidification over the past 60 years in this region is mostly the result of rapidly increasing of levels of atmospheric CO contributed by human activities. This suggests that the increasing of anthropogenic CO 2 in atmosphere has caused significant acidification in the oceans in the past decades, especially in coastal regions and that the rate of ocean acidification is increasing.",

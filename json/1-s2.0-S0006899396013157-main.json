Originally, convulsions were considered a factor that complicated the more immediate life-threatening effects that nerve agents have on the respiratory system [22] . However, recent evidence indicates that OP-induced convulsions rapidly progress to status epilepticus and contribute to profound irreversible brain damage [ 171. Therefore, effective management of OP-induced convulsions is critical for both immediate casualty treatment and minimization of neuropathology [2] . It has been shown recently that soman initiated convulsions and associated treatment may involve non-cholinergic neurotransmitter systems as well [ 181. We and others have demonstrated that generalized seizures produce significant and prolonged increases of the neuropeptide, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRHI in seizure-susceptible subregions of the brain [l2] . Thus, the present study was undertaken to determine if soman-induced convulsions could produce similar increases in brain TRH. Portions of this study have been previously presented [ I3] Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-306 g) were obtained from Charles River Labs, housed in temperature-Ie saline (0.9% NaCII was purchased , obtained from the Engineering Center (Aberdeen Proving Ground, I. was diluted in ice-cold saline prior to injection.

                "text": "Organophosphorus compounds such as soman are PO-tent cbolinesterase inhibitors whose effects cause hyptrractivity of the cholincrgic systenl ilS it result of iMX_W-d acetylcholine at central and peripheral synapses [25] . This leads IO a progression of' toxic signs. including hyprrsccretions. convulsions and ultimately death [XI. At the soma dose given herein, our behavioral and claolinesterase findings (Table I) were consistent with previously published observations [25] in all except two rats that did not co19vulse. It is generally acknowledged. however. that plasma and RBC cholinesterase activity provide an index of soman exposure, Thus, we theorize that in the two non-responders, CNS soman levels were insufficient to induce overt convulsions and/or inhibit TRH metabolism but were adeqliLll:* to significantly reduce circulating cholinestcrasc activity in the periphery. The magnitude of the postictal increases of TRH in cortical regions, especially in frontal cortex (30-fold). was the most striking finding of the present study. Previous studies using electroconvulsive seizures (ECSI, electrically kindled and pentylenetetrazol (PTZI-induced seizures revealed between 2-and 4-fold TRH increases 48 h postictally [ 121. In the present study, total TRH content in frontal cortex alone increased from a mean of 126 pg to 3235 pg after soman convulsions. When applied on a weight basis to the other cortical regions, including the hippocampal formation, the soman-induced increase in cortical TRH is considerable and far exceeds that found in the hypothalamus, the forebrain region that normally contains the highest TRH content [9] . Perhaps the severity and prolongation of the convulsions are contributory in the marked TRH increases. In contrast to kindled or ECS-induced convulsions which are relatively brief, [!9] soman-induced convulsions have been reported to last as long as 6 h. with EEG spikes observed as much as 24 h later [18] . Interestingly, Kreider et a!. [S] found that long-lasting (3-4 h) kainate-induced convulsions resulted in TRH elevations that were greater in hippocampus and posterior cortex than those obtained with either ECS or kindling 1121 and approached those reported herein in similar tissues. Since soman-and kninate-induced convulsions are associated with alterations in glutamate release [28] . it is possible that excitatory amino acids may be involved in the ovcral! TRH response. This prospect raises the issue of whether soman is having both a primary and/or secondary effect on ncuronal TRW through other neurotransmitter systems. Moreover, the origin of neocortical TRH is not firmly established, leading to speculation that the cortical changes reported here could be derived from either extrinsic and/or intrinsic sources [5,!6], Noteworthy was the absence of a soman effect on TRH in the hypothalamus and pituitary. These two structures fail to elicit a posticta! TRH increase by other seizure paradigms as well 1121. Surprisingly, the z-fold increase of TRH in the amygdala of soman-treated convulsant rats was similar to that seen after ECS, kindled, PTZ, or kainate-induced seizures [8.!2] . This suggests that soman had little potentiating effect on the posticta! TRIH response in this structure. Since the amygdala is known to have increased TRH mRNA postictally [I I], one would have expected to observe greater than a I-fold TRH increase in this locus of soman-injected animals if soman had either a stabilizing effect on TRH mRNA. or a direct effect on enhancing the rate of posttranslational pro-TRH processing [ 141. Further-ttK% lack of a soman effect on TRH in the hypothalamus and pituitary, two tissues that contain TRH cells [S], argues against direct soman effects on TRH biosynthesis and/or its metabolism in these tissues.",

Thus. high cortical TRH levels following soman could reflect an endogenous response to reduce neurona! excitability. This is consistent with the observation that TRH inhibits glutamate-stimulated influx of calcium into cultured neurons 171. On the other hand, data also exist which indicate that TRH augments ncetylcholine release [20, 27] . Thus. TRH could possibly potentiatc the soman-induced cholinergic effects in the brain. Further, TRH has been shown to have actions on autonomic, motor. sensory and limbic systems. arousal, temperature regulation. appetite and gastrointestinal function [ 141. Which system(s) mlty be affected by elevated TRH. and for how long after acute soman exposure remains to be determined.",

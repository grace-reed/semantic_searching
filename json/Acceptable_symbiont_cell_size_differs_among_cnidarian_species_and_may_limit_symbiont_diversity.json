Symbiodinium are genetically and physiologically diverse, and corals may be able to adapt to different environments by altering their dominant Symbiodinium phylotype. Notably, each coral species associates only with specific Symbiodinium phylotypes, and consequently the diversity of symbionts available to the host is limited by the species specificity. Currently, it is widely presumed that species specificity is determined by the combination of cell-surface molecules on the host and symbiont. Here we show experimental evidence supporting a new model to explain at least part of the specificity in coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis. Using the laboratory model Aiptasia-Symbiodinium system, we found that symbiont infectivity is related to cell size; larger Symbiodinium phylotypes are less likely to establish a symbiotic relationship with the host Aiptasia. This size dependency is further supported by experiments where symbionts were replaced by artificial fluorescent microspheres. Finally, experiments using two different coral species demonstrate that our size-dependent-infection model can be expanded to coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis, with the acceptability of large-sized Symbiodinium phylotypes differing between two coral species. Thus the selectivity of the host for symbiont cell size can affect the diversity of symbionts in corals.",

There are two main ways for this to occur; they can be inherited from the parent (vertical transmission) or obtained directly from the environment (horizontal transmission). Vertical transmission occurs in select host taxa (for example, brooding corals) that release eggs or brooded planula larvae only after symbionts have been transferred to the offspring. Horizontal transmission could potentially happen in any host taxon, mainly in the early developing stages but can also occur in the adult stage (Baker, 2003) .",

Furthermore, the degree of specificity differed among both the host species and the Symbiodinium phylotypes (LaJeunesse, 2002; Baker, 2003) , restricting the range of compatible partners. In corals, the in situ symbionts can differ between larvae and adult polyps (Little et al., 2004) . Therefore, it has been suggested that species specificity can vary with life stage. However, a study in the sea anemone Aiptasia showed that symbiont specificity did not change with life stage (Hambleton et al., 2014) .",

Fluoresbrite microspheres and Symbiodinium were excited at 488 nm (emission: 499-561 nm) and 633 nm (emission: 648-735 nm), respectively. Transmitted light was collected after excitation at 633 nm. Z-stacks were taken (0.7 \u03bcm between each single plane) and processing, including 3D reconstruction and depth indexation, was performed using the Zen 2012 software package (Zeiss).",

As cell division generally occurs during the dark period (Fitt and Trench, 1983) , cell size measurements were conducted in the middle of the light period to avoid counting dividing cells. The average Symbiodinium cell size differed among strains and ranged from 6.7 to 11.0 \u03bcm (Figure 1) . The maximum and minimum cell sizes also differed among strains but scaled with their average cell size, that is, the maximum and minimum cell sizes were smaller in the smaller Symbiodinium strains (Figure 1) . In this study, we classified Symbiodinium strains into three groups based on their average cell diameter: small (o8.0 \u03bcm, n = 5), medium (8.0-10.0 \u03bcm, n = 6), and large (410.0 \u03bcm, n = 4; Figure 1 ).

To test infection efficiency, an individual Aiptasia polyp was separately exposed to a single Symbiodinium strain. Infection by Symbiodinium was monitored by observing the recovery of chlorophyll fluorescence in the host over 35 days (Supplementary Figure S2 ). An Aiptasia polyp was said to be infected when 430 foci of Symbiodinium cells could be seen within an Aiptasia tentacle. Infection follows the uptake of Symbiodinium cells into the gastrovascular cavity (stomach). All Symbiodinium strains were taken into the stomach within 2 days after inoculation.

The time taken to infect varied considerably between Symbiodinium strains, ranging from 5 to 35 days, consistent with a previous report (Belda-Baillie et al., 2002) .

In each experiment, approximately 12 000 microspheres were fed directly into the mouth of individual Aiptasia already harboring Symbiodinium (n = 3) and the number of microspheres located in tentacles was monitored for 6 days (Figures 3a and b ). An individual Aiptasia polyp was said to have incorporated the microspheres when 430 could be seen within a tentacle. All three Aiptasia polyps tested successfully incorporated 6.3 and 10.4 \u03bcm microspheres in 6 h and 2-3 days, respectively. Compared with our infectivity assay results, the microspheres were taken up much faster than the Symbiodinium cells. This is possibly because the microspheres were fed directly into the mouth of the host and were therefore quickly and abundantly taken up into the gastrovascular cavity. Importantly, none of the Aiptasia polyps tested with the 11.4 \u03bcm microspheres reached the threshold needed to ensure that they had incorporated the microspheres, although a small number were seen in the tentacles (Figure 3a) . Interestingly, all microspheres seen in the tentacles were completely expelled from the polyps after 6 days (Figure 3a) . This result indicates that microspheres are not able to be retained in host cells.",

However, it cannot be determined whether these Symbiodinium strains were residing within host cells or rather were present on the surface of the organisms at the time of isolation.

It is therefore conceivable that the maximum threshold for symbiont cell size differs among host species and that the infectivity of the symbiont is related to both the cell size of the symbiont and the maximum size threshold of the host.",

These coral species were chosen as they do not undergo vertical transmission and therefore aposymbiont juvenile polyps can be readily obtained in the laboratory from collected egg-sperm bundles. Individual polyps of each coral species were incubated with a single Symbiodinium strain and infection was visually monitored over 30 days for C. serailia and 35 days for A. tenuis (Supplementary Figure S3) . In A. tenuis, 8 of the 11 Symbiodinium strains tested could infect the juvenile polyps (Figure 5a ). The three remaining Symbiodinium strains were all large sized. Two of these strains failed to infect after 35 days, and the third one (L830) caused all the polyps to die after 14 days (Figure 5a ). These results demonstrated that symbiont cell size also influenced infectivity in corals. In C. serailia, all Symbiodinium strains tested were able to infect the host, including the large-sized strains, albeit their infection being much slower than that of small-and medium-sized strains (Figure 5b ). Total infection of all juvenile polyps was achieved in 7 days, 7-25 days, and 25-28 days for small-, medium-and large-sized strains, respectively (Figure 5b) . As each Symbiodinium culture contained a range of cell sizes (Figure 1 ), we isolated symbionts from infected C. serailia and confirmed the presence of the largest cells of the large-sized Symbiodinium strains in the host (Supplementary Figure S4) .",

The average cell size differed among Symbiodinium strains of the same clade: ranging from 7.9 to 10.1 \u03bcm in clade A and from 6.7 to 8.5 \u03bcm in clade B. Furthermore, the cell size significantly differed among Symbiodinium strains of the same subclade (cp23S-rDNA genotype); for instance, within the A194 subclade five phylotypes were measured with sizes ranging from 7.9 to 10.1 \u03bcm. Overall, however, clade A Symbiodinium strains were generally larger than clade B Symbiodinium strains ( Figure 6 ). Thus our results suggest that the infectivity of different Symbiodinium strains can be inferred from their genotype. This hypothesis is compatible with previous results showing that clade B (type B1) Symbiodinium infect diverse coral species (LaJeunesse, 2002) , whereas clade A (type A2) Symbiodinium have a high selectivity toward host species (LaJeunesse, 2001) .

However, in the present study, we found the infectivity of Symbiodinium strains toward both Aiptasia (Figure 2 ) and A. tenuis (Figure 5a ) correlated with symbiont cell size. Furthermore, experiments testing the incorporation of microspheres into host cells confirmed that the size of the particle influences uptake, while also suggesting that the presence of specific cell surface proteins may not be necessary for this process (Figure 3 ). We therefore conclude that the infectivity potential of Symbiodinium strains is influenced by their cell size. This result is consistent with our general understanding of the mechanism of phagocytosis, which is known to be affected by the size of the material to be engulfed (Tabata and Ikada, 1988; Champion et al., 2008) . However, we still cannot exclude that large-sized Symbiodinium cells may be less well circulated throughout the gastrovascular cavity and therefore have a lower chance of being taken up by the host cells. It should be noted that, in our study, Symbiodinium CCMP2470 could quickly infect A. tenuis but a significant number of the symbionts dissociated from the host after 35 days (Figure 5a ). Furthermore, the fluorescent microspheres that were taken into host cells were all expelled in 6 days (Figure 3a) . These results suggest that at least one additional mechanism (for example, membrane surface molecules, cell division or the production of energy) is important to engage and maintain a symbiotic relationship and that creating beneficial symbiosis requires more than the sole ability of entering the host cell (Davy et al., 2012) .",

In the study using A. tagetes, one of the smallest Symbiodinium strains tested failed to infect. Conversely, in the C. xamachana study, one of the large Symbiodinium strains tested succeeded in infecting. Therefore, while previous data showed a similar trend to that being reported here, a single outlier in each experiment meant there was no clear correlation between infection and size; rather it was suggested that species specificity is not related to symbiont cell size (Schoenberg and Trench, 1980) . The reason why these two studies did not find a definitive correlation between infection and size is unclear, but it indicates that additional factors may also affect species specificity and infectivity. It is conceivable that rapid procurement of new symbionts from the environment could be important for corals to adapt to environmental changes. Previous studies have demonstrated that infection speed differs among Symbiodinium strains (Belda-Baillie et al., 2002) . However, the mechanism controlling the infection speed remained unclear. In the present study, we found that infection speed was related to symbiont cell size in both sea anemone ( Figure 2c ) and corals ( Figure 5 ). This finding was supported by experimental data using microspheres of different sizes; smaller microspheres were taken into host cells significantly faster than larger ones (Figures 3a and b) . However, cell size might not be the only factor determining the infection speed, and it is conceivable that cell number (Colley and Trench, 1983) and cell mortality may also influence infection speed. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that corals living in environments maintaining abundant and diverse small Symbiodinium strains, for example, clade B Symbiodinium, may have a greater chance of quickly recruiting new symbionts and therefore adapting to environmental changes.",

Our findings suggest a possible selection mechanism of infection that can explain these observations: host species with a higher maximum threshold of symbiont cell size may acquire more diverse Symbiodinium phylotypes, whereas host species with a lower threshold may acquire a more limited range of phylotypes (that is, small-sized Symbiodinium phylotypes). Furthermore, small-sized Symbiodinium phylotypes may infect many host species, whereas large-sized Symbiodinium phylotypes may exhibit a more limited host range (that is, only hosts with a higher maximum threshold for symbiont cell size). However, not all Symbiodinium phylotypes able to infect a host can maintain a symbiotic relationship, for instance, when the environmental conditions are not suitable. Therefore, the combinations of host and symbiont seen in the field are likely to be determined by multiple factors, rather than infectivity alone.",

The sensitivity of corals to bleaching under increased seawater temperature differs among coral species (Marshall and Baird, 2000; Loya et al., 2001) . However, the bleaching sensitivity is influenced by the dominant in situ Symbiodinium phylotype within the coral (Glynn et al., 2001 ), suggesting that corals may at least temporarily acclimatize to a warm environment if they possess suitable (that is, heat tolerant) Symbiodinium phylotypes (Baker, 2001; Baker et al., 2004; Lewis and Coffroth, 2004; Rowan, 2004; Berkelmans and van Oppen, 2006; Jones et al., 2008; Howells et al., 2012) .

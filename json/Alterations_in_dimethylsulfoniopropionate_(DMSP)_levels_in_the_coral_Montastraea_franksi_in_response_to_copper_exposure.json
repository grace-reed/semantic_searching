    "abstract": "Symbiotic corals routinely experience hyperoxic conditions within their tissues due to the photosynthesis of the endosymbiotic dinoflagellate microalgae (Symbiodinium spp.). Symbiodinium spp. produce high intracellular levels of the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). It has recently been discovered in marine algae that DMSP and its enzymatic breakdown products also play a significant role in the scavenging of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). To examine this potential for DMSP in corals, we exposed the hard coral Montastraea franksi to 1, 10 and 50 g L \u22121 (ppb) concentrations of the oxidative stressor, copper. Levels of total (DMSP t , all coral tissue) were higher than particulate DMSP p (algal component only), demonstrating partitioning of DMSP between algal symbionts and coral host. Significant changes in levels of DMSP t and DMSP p occurred in M. franksi after 48 h, demonstrating a response to copper and indicating a potential antioxidant role for DMSP. DMSP t and DMSP p levels decreased with copper dose, although at the highest copper dose DMSP p levels increased, whereas DMSP t levels did not. This observed differential response to copper between DMSP t and DMSP p demonstrates that physiological changes may be overlooked if conclusions are based upon DMSP t levels alone, which is a common measure used in coral studies. Decreases in chlorophyll a and algal cell numbers in response to elevated copper were also observed. These indices are important physiological indicators and are often used as indices to normalize DMSP levels. Our data suggest that the use of these common indices for normalizing DMSP may not always be appropriate.",

To mitigate against potentially damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (O \u2212 ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hydroxyl radical ( \u2022 OH), and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), corals possess various constitutive and/or inducible enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems, including superoxide dismutases, glutathione, xanthophylls and ascorbate peroxidases (for a review see Lesser, 2006) . However, inherent physiological stress in coral symbioses can be compounded by additional exogenous oxidative stressors. For example, environmental pollutants can exacerbate conditions of oxidative stress in corals, compromising their ability to cope with and recover from imposed stressors by overwhelming their antioxidant protective system (Downs et al., 2002) . Symbiodinium spp. and many other species of marine algae, produce high intracellular levels of the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) (Keller et al., 1989; Keller and Korjeff-Bellows, 1996; Van Alstyne et al., 2006; Yoch, 2002) . It has recently been discovered in marine algae that DMSP and its enzymatic breakdown products also play a significant role in the scavenging of cellular ROS (Sunda et al., 2002) . Since damage by ROS has been implicated in the physiological mechanism underlying coral bleaching -the stress related dissociation of the coral-algal symbiosis which occurs during exposure to elevated water temperatures and a suite of other stressors (see for example Lesser et al., 1990 ) -it is not surprising that the role of DMSP in corals is of growing interest.",

However, DMSP and its enzymatic breakdown products, dimethylsulfide (DMS), acrylate, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and methane sulfinic acid (MSNA) can readily scavenge hydroxyl radicals and other ROS (Sunda et 0166-445X/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.03.005 al., 2002) . Significant in this regard is the enzymatic cleavage of DMSP by DMSP lyase (DL), as the cleavage products, acrylate and DMSO are 60 and 20 times, respectively, more effective in scavenging hydroxyl radicals than DMSP itself (Sunda et al., 2002) . Additionally, this suite of antioxidant compounds can scavenge ROS in multiple cellular compartments as it is composed of water-or lipid-soluble scavengers of the extremely harmful hydroxyl radical and other ROS. DMS and DMSO can neutralize lipid peroxidation in photosynthetic membranes and harmful radicals in chloroplasts, respectively, thus targeting important ROS sites (Lee and de Mora, 1999) .",

It has been established that the symbiotic dinoflagellates of corals produce DMSP and have DL capabilities, but so far DL has not been shown to exist in corals or other host species harboring symbiotic dinoflagellates (Hill et al., 2004) . It is known that there is a considerable variation in DMSP levels within zooxanthellae clades (Yost and Mitchelmore, 2009) and it is plausible that the translocation of DMSP from symbiont to host occurs (Hill et al., 2004) , highlighting the need for particulate DMSP (algal cells only; DMSP p ) quantification in addition to total DMSP (algal and host cells; DMSP t ) measures. Elevated levels of DMS above stressed reefs have led authors to suggest the involvement of DMSP in a corals stress response (Jones et al., 2007) .",

Copper was used in these experiments as it is known to cause oxidative stress by catalyzing the formation of the hydroxyl radical by Haber-Weiss and Fenton reactions, from the photosynthetic by-product, hydrogen peroxide (Abalde et al., 1995; Okamoto et al., 2001) . The hydroxyl radical is the most powerful oxidizing radical likely to arise in biological systems, and is capable of reacting with practically every biological molecule (Buettner, 1993) , resulting in damage to lipids, proteins and nucleic acids (Gutteridge and Wilkins, 1983) .",

For example, copper reduces fertilization success (i.e. EC 50 values ranging from 14.5 to 39.7 g L \u22121 (Heyward, 1988; Negri and Heyward, 2001; Harrison, 1999, 2005) . Sublethal loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates and bleaching of tissues has been reported in adult corals exposed to concentrations of 10-60 g L \u22121 Cu between 2 and 10 days (Evans, 1977; Jones, 1997 Jones, , 2004 ; however, not all studies report sublethal loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates (for example Grant et al., 2003) . Several studies have reported copper threshold levels of sublethal stress between 20 and 50 g L \u22121 in different species of cultured dinoflagellates (Goh and Chou, 1997; Mandelli, 1969) and reduced specific growth rates at 40 g L \u22121 (Goh and Chou, 1997) . Alterations in chlorophyll a (chl-a) concentrations in Symbiodinium spp. and other algae have also been reported in response to copper stress (e.g. see Brown, 2000; Edmunds et al., 2003; Fitt et al., 1993; Gleason and Wellington, 1993; Grant et al., 2003; Nystrom et al., 2001; Sunda et al., 2002) . Corals also respond to alleviate copper toxicity by up-regulating cellular defense mechanisms, including antioxidants (Gilbert and Guzman, 2001; Grant et al., 2003; Mitchelmore et al., 2007; Morgan et al., 2001 Morgan et al., , 2005 Morgan and Snell, 2006; Venn et al., 2009) .",

Indeed, we found that DMSP t concentrations were greater than DMSP p concentrations, evidence that supports this potential DMSP translocation. The significance of DMSP in host tissues is yet unknown and may depend, in part, on whether host coral cells have DL. If host corals have DL, then DMSP, through its conversion to subsequently more powerful antioxidants as shown by Sunda et al. (2002) , could be used to protect host tissues from excessive oxidative stress (as could DMSP itself). Alternatively, high concentrations of DMSP in host tissues could perturb host protein/enzyme functions, a condition that could be ameliorated by host DL (i.e. similar to other detoxifying enzymes) (Karsten et al., 1996; Nishiguchi and Somero, 1992) .

Several antioxidant functions in corals resulting from Symbiodinum spp. DMSP and DL activities have been recently inferred (Jones et al., 2007; Yost and Mitchelmore, 2009) . Given that DMSP is at mM concentrations within the symbiotic algal cells, DMSP may be a critical and multifaceted component in a coral's overall antioxidant defense mechanism. If DMSP is being used as an antioxidant under conditions of oxidative stress, levels may decrease following initial or chronic exposures as DMSP and its conversion products are being used as ROS scavengers. Indeed, we found that levels of DMSP p decreased following exposure to 5 and 10 g L \u22121 copper. Conversely, in response to excess ROS, higher intracellular concentrations of DMSP may result from an up-regulation (increased production) of DMSP. For example, alterations in intracellular concentrations of DMSP have been linked to oxidative stressors including high Cu 2+ (ions) in marine algae (Sunda et al., 2002 (Sunda et al., , 2005 . This potential up-regulation could explain why levels of DMSP p did not differ from control levels at the highest copper dose. The threshold for the up-regulation of DMSP in response to oxidative stress is unknown and may reflect ROS levels, or occur once a low, threshold level of DMSP is reached. Therefore, changes in DMSP levels in corals may be complex and biphasic, particularly given the nature of the symbiotic relationship, as DMSP (and its conversion products) can be diffusively or actively passed from the algae to the host cells.",

Corals showed a decrease in DMSP t concentrations per cm 2 and loss of algal cells with increasing concentrations of copper, although only significant at the highest dose. When DMSP t levels were normalized to algal cell number, no significant reduction in DMSP t at the highest copper dose was evident. Therefore, results based solely on DMSP t levels normalized to coral surface area (commonly used in the coral field) may simply reflect algal cell loss. Indeed, the loss of algae between controls and high copper dose averages 17%, mirroring the average 23% loss of DMSP t .

These decreases may be due to a decrease in intracellular DMSP pools (as previously discussed) and/or an increase in DL, where the up-regulation of the enzyme could be accomplished through increased DL biosynthesis or changes in DL affinity for the DMSP substrate under conditions of oxidative stress. However, there was no reduction in DMSP p concentrations at 50 g L \u22121 Cu, i.e. the exposure at which DMSP t (on a per surface area basis) and algal cell contents were significantly reduced. This indicates that, even with fewer zooxanthellae at the highest copper exposure, DMSP concentrations in the remaining algae likely increased or at least were maintained (via increased production) at the original control levels. Fig. 4 demonstrates only a slight DMSP p increase (i.e. 19.6-21.1 fmol cell \u22121 ), although elevated production will be missed if the algae are translocating DMSP to the host, which in turn is being used to maintain the steady levels seen in the DMSP t response (on a per algal basis).

                "text": "Interestingly, similar trends emerged for DMSP p (nmol cm \u22122 , fmol cell \u22121 ), chl-a and protein concentrations, all of which were reduced at 5 and 10 g L \u22121 Cu but returned to control levels at 50 g L \u22121 Cu. It is known that bleaching can reduce algal number and/or chl-a concentrations (Gleason and Wellington, 1993; Porter et al., 1989) . Also, copper exposure has been reported to cause reductions in photosynthetic pigments (chl-a)/efficiency as well as algal cell loss (bleaching) and even increases in total carotenoids, implying oxidative damage to lipids (Droppa and Horvath, 1990; Jones, 1997; Sunda et al., 2002; Grant et al., 2003) . However, chl-a concentrations are known to increase on a per cell basis in bleached corals and M. franksi specifically (Fitt et al., 1993; Edmunds et al., 2003) . Nystrom et al. (2001) reported no copper (11 g L \u22121 ) effects on acutely exposed corals, though corals pre-exposed to increased levels of copper had significant reductions in gross primary production. Others report no decrease in chl-a (Brown, 2000; Grant et al., 2003) and no decrease in photosynthetic capacity in corals chronically exposed to copper (Grant et al., 2003) , though excess copper usually decreases photosynthesis (Droppa and Horvath, 1990) . A parallel increase in DMSP p at 50 g L \u22121 Cu and an increase in chla (relative to the lower copper doses) may indicate that DMSP and its conversion products are acting as a protective mechanism, scavenging ROS at the site of production in zooxanthellae, a hypoth-esis worthy of further investigation. Additionally, whether up-or down-regulation (or loss) of chl-a is occurring, these data demonstrate that this commonly used algal DMSP indice and may not be appropriate when investigating levels in response to 'natural' or anthropogenic stressors.",

There are several plausible explanations for the observed changes in total protein. Proteins can be up-or down-regulated, damaged due to ROS, or degraded. The DMSP pool may be controlled by the availability of methionine, via protein degradation (a process known to occur in times of increased stress, i.e. as evidenced by elevated heat shock proteins and ubiquitin levels in stressed corals; Downs et al., 2000 Downs et al., , 2002 , therefore liberating this key amino acid and providing the necessary building blocks for increased DMSP synthesis.",

Our data clearly show that these indices change in response to oxidative stress and cannot be used when investigating DMSP-related questions in a toxicological arena. This includes investigations of stressors (e.g. solar irradiance, temperature or chemical pollutants) that are known to alter these parameters. It is also noted that indices such as coral surface area can limit the interpretation of DMSP concentrations as, for example, DMSP concentrations per surface area may decrease in some cases simply as a result of algal cell loss. Furthermore, our analysis of DMSP p and DMSP t levels demonstrates that algal physiological responses (i.e. use (loss) or alternately up-regulation of DMSP p ) may be masked by DMSP levels in coral host cells (DMSP t ).",

Additionally, common indices used to normalize DMSP concentrations in coral changed significantly (chl-a, protein, algal cell number) with copper exposure, highlighting the importance of normalizing DMSP to indices that remain unchanged throughout the duration of toxicological studies (e.g. coral surface area). Common DMSP normalization indices may not be operable in coral DMSP studies due to the complex nature of the algal-animal symbiosis. The added complexity of toxicological research also limits the available DMSP normalization indices because the indices themselves often respond to stress. These data make a strong case for further investigations that aim to quantify both symbiont and host DMSP concentrations in an effort to better understand the role and function of DMSP in corals. Our data for DMSP p and chl-a at the highest copper dose suggest that DMSP may serve as a key antioxidant in zooxanthellae (and potentially their host coral), ameliorating the effects of ROS production in response to copper exposure. Finally, higher DMSP t versus DMSP p concentrations are suggestive of DMSP translocation from symbiont to host, but further experiments are needed to substantiate this. While the underlying physiological function(s) and regulation of DMSP in corals remains undetermined, we present evidence that DMSP may contribute to the inherent antioxidant systems present in zooxanthellae, thus serving a supportive antioxidant role.",

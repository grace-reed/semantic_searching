    "abstract": "The mitigation of biofouling has received significant research attention, with particular focus on non-toxic and sustainable strategies. Here, we investigated quorum sensing inhibitor (QSI) bacteria as a means of controlling biofouling in a laboratory-scale system. Approximately, 200 strains were isolated from coral (Pocillopora damicornis) and screened for their ability to inhibit quorum sensing (QS). Approximately, 15% of the isolates exhibited QSI activity, and a typical coral symbiotic bacterium, H12-Vibrio alginolyticus, was selected in order for us to investigate quorum sensing inhibitory activity further. Confocal microscopy revealed that V. alginolyticus extract inhibited biofilm formation from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. In addition, the secondary metabolites of V. alginolyticus inhibited PAO1 virulence phenotypes by downregulating motility ability, elastase activity and rhamnolipid production. NMR and MS spectrometry suggested that the potential bioactive compound involved was rhodamine isothiocyanate. Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that the bacterial extract induced a significant downregulation of QS regulatory genes (lasB, lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR) and virulence-related genes (pqsA, pqsR). The possible mechanism underlying the action of rhodamine isothiocyanate analogue involves the disruption of the las and/or rhl system of PAO1. Our results highlight coral microbes as a bioresource pool for developing QS inhibitors and identifying novel antifouling agents.",

The establishment of biofilms in the aquatic environment typically begins with the settlement of microorganisms (bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes), followed by the recruitment of macrofouling species (invertebrate larvae and algal spores) (Dobretsov, 2009) whose accumulation leads to considerable economic consequences for aquaculture equipment, naval vessels and a variety of industrial structures (Braithwaite and McEvoy, 2005; Schultz et al., 2011; Fitridge et al., 2012) . Although biocide treatments, including antifouling paints (such as tributyltin and copper), are effective against biofouling, many of these toxins are highly destructive pollutants when used in marine ecosystems (Voulvoulis et al., 2002; Yebra et al., 2004; Thomas and Brooks, 2010) . Consequently, there is a need to pursue novel, environmental-friendly, and non-toxic compounds that are capable of inhibiting the development of marine biofilms.",

The latter are being increasingly recognized for their important roles in the fouling process, and inhibitors of biofilm formation or interference with bacterial signalling processes can mitigate the development of biofilm or even lead to biofilm decline without any toxic effects on the microbes (Deziel et al., 2001) . For example, nitric oxide (NO), an intracellular signalling molecule, has been shown to induce a reduction in biofilm (Barraud et al., 2006) .",

Research targeting the bacterial QS system has paid significant attention to the identification of effective QS or biofilm inhibition agents. Therefore, using QS inhibitors or QSI compounds that degrade signalling molecules to mitigate biofilm fouling represents a significant breakthrough (Dobretsov, 2009) . Since then, several studies have demonstrated that QSI compounds are capable of reducing the formation of biofilm and further inhibit the development of biofouling (Cushnie and Lamb, 2011; Dobretsov et al., 2011; Karina et al., 2013) . Some antifouling substances have recently been identified in microbes and plants (and even animals); these are peptide compounds, such as quorum-quenching enzyme and small-molecule compounds (Huang et al., 2016; Bzdrenga et al., 2017) . Of particular note, is furanone, a traditional inhibitor that is a potent antagonist of Gramnegative bacteria (Hentzer et al., 2003) , and a type of long-chain fatty aldehyde, identified as pentadecanal, which acts against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm (Casillo et al., 2017) , as well as the 2-sufonylpyrimidines which can significantly inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm (Thomann et al., 2016) .",

Furthermore, studies increasingly point to types of planktonic marine bacteria, such as Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Pseudoalteromonsa spp., and Vibrio spp., as frequent sources for the production of QSI compounds (Teasdale et al., 2009; Mangwani et al., 2015; Benneche et al., 2016; Casillo et al., 2017) . Compared with the planktonic environment, coral ecosystems have a much higher biodiversity and represent a potential source from which to isolate QS inhibitors. Indeed, several studies have described the QSI or antibiofilm potential of several natural compounds originating from coral, including the soft coral Antillogorgia elisabethae, the black coral Antipathes dichotoma, the octocoral Eunicea knighti and the cave coral Acropora millepora (Tello et al., 2012; Karina et al., 2013; Diana et al., 2016) . The wide existence of QSI bacteria in coral environments invites us to explore the feasibility of QSI-based biofouling control methods. We hypothesize that coral-associated bacteria, and their metabolic substances, offer an effective antibiofouling resource in the marine environment.",

Given the limited knowledge available on their production by coral bacteria, the aim of our study was to gain a clearer understanding of the ecological relevance of QSI substances secreted by coral-symbiotic microbes. Here, we used coral as the source material to screen QSI bacteria, and explored isolated bacteria for their QSI potential.

Subsequently, the antibiofilm activity of the potent extract (V. alginolyticus 12) was tested against the wild-type of the widely used biofilm forming isolate P. aeruginosa PAO1. Figure 2C shows the quantitative analysis of PAO1 biofilm inhibition. A dose-dependent pattern of inhibition was observed with PAO1 biofilm in response to V. alginolyticus 12 extract treatment. The most significant effect appeared at a concentration of 10 lg ml \u00c01 , which caused the biofilm formation to decrease by 37.5% (P < 0.05).

Considering its topology, a well-grown biofilm with adherent bacterial cells was observed in the negative controls (i.e. a normal biofilm developed by P. aeruginosa PAO1), whereas dispersed bacterial cells were observed in the positive control ( Fig. S3, b1 and b2 ) and the treated sample (Fig. S3, a1 and c1). Extremely thick biofilms (containing more cells and polysaccharides) were formed in the negative control relative to those of the experimental group. Furthermore, images clearly showed a disrupted surface topology and height distribution profile of the biofilm that developed in the presence of the V. alginolyticus 12 extract when compared with the control biofilm (taking 36 h as an example; Fig. S3, a2 and c2 ). In the negative control group, P. aeruginosa PAO1 developed a thick, dense biofilm after 12 h, whereas on a surface coated with the V. alginolyticus 12 bioactive crude extract, biofilm formation and bacterial adherence were prevented (Fig. S3, a1 and c1) . At 36 h, corresponding to the mature period of biofilm, viable P. aeruginosa cells accounted for a larger proportion than found in the negative control, which confirmed that strain H12 extract was not toxic to cells within the biofilm. Furthermore, the large proportion of live cells also demonstrated that the QSI extract delayed the biofilm's development (Fig. S3 , a2 and c2).",

All of these compounds, especially when used in large amounts, or in confined environments, pose serious health and environmental problems due to their toxicity or ecotoxicity (Voulvoulis et al., 2002; Yebra et al., 2004; Thomas and Brooks, 2010) . The search for QSI compounds has since turned to the ocean and its abundant variety of organisms, many of which are already known to produce useful bioactive compounds, such as halogenated furanones produced by the red alga D. pulchra (Rasmussen et al., 2000) , brominated alkaloids from Flustra foliacea (Peters et al., 2003) , and kojic acid from E. knighti (Dobretsov et al., 2011) . More recently, the culture supernatant from Antarctic marine bacterium P. haloplanktis TAC125 was shown to impair the formation of S. epidermidis biofilm (Papa et al., 2013; Parrilli et al., 2015) . These findings demonstrate that QSI compounds are valuable antifouling agents in that they could serve as potential effective additives to environmentally friendly commercial antifouling paints due to their non-toxicity (Tello et al., 2012) .",

Among the array of marine niches, screening for antifouling compounds from coral symbiotic microbes is of particular interest because of their high biodiversity and rich secondary metabolism (Mohamed et al., 2008; Fusetani, 2011; Karina et al., 2013) . In our present study, we found that 15% of coral-associated bacteria exhibited inhibition activity against C. violaceum 12472. Previous studies reported that approximately 11-24% of the coralassociated bacteria sampled were capable of QS inhibition activity against E. coli pSB1075, C. violaceum CV026 and A. tumefaciens KYC55 indicator strains (Romero et al., 2011; Karina et al., 2013) . Our results are in line with these proportions and further suggest that coral ecosystems represent an ideal reservoir from which to develop QSI products.",

Indeed, in the present study, strain H12 stood out in particular and the presence of 16s rRNA confirmed that this strain belonged to the Vibrio genus (hence, we named this strain V. alginolyticus 12). Using fermentation broth extract from this particular strain, we observed a 37.5% inhibition of the biofilm's biomass at the highest concentration of H12 extract (Fig. 2C ). This result indicates that bioactivity exudates were potentially present in the extracellular matrix, and that QSI activity compounds are capable of interfering with the QS system to influence the formation of biofilm in the model G \u00c0 strain PAO1. Interestingly, V. alginolyticus 12 did not affect the growth of P. aeruginosa (Fig. 2D) . Similarly, when the cytotoxic effects of isothiocyanate on the mammalian cell line L929 were investigated, they also showed no cytotoxic effects (Borges et al., 2014) . These characteristics suggest that the target compounds are relatively safe antifouling agents, which should promote their broad-scale development and application as QSI compounds.",

When this compound was applied as a treatment, it caused a significant reduction in biofilm density and thickness in the form of a flattened biofilm lacking structural heterogeneity, whereas P. aeruginosa formed a highly structured biofilm in the absence of this compound. Z-stack images from confocal laser scanning microscopy showed this reduction clearly (Fig. S3 ). Light microscopy also revealed a considerable effect upon the mean thickness and roughness coefficient in the treatment group (data not shown). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of rhodamine isothiocyanate, or its analogue, functioning as an antibiofilm agent from marine Vibrio spp. From the analysis of chemical structure, it is evident that the hexatomic ring appears in several types of AHL signal, such as HHQ and PQS (Grandclement et al., 2016) . The inhibition properties of this agent may arise from competitive binding with the transport protein that interrupts the transcription of the AHL signal. Several types of isothiocyanate-benzylisothiocyanate (BITC), 2-phenylethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) have been reported to exhibit QSI activity and are also known to affect the QS system, based on the high structural similarity among signal molecules (Borges et al., 2014) . This result supported our hypothesis that AHL-based analogues can operate as QS modulators or antibiofilm agents. Because the QSI activity was confirmed when pure commercial rhodamine isothiocyanate was used, it led us to propose that the QS inhibitory activity produced by strain H12 is driven by rhodamine isothiocyanate or its analogue.",

We know that QS genes play a crucial role in the synthesis of EPS, the most critical component of biofilm, and in biofilm maturation. In particular, lasI regulates the expression of several genes involved in the production of the glucose rich EPS-matrix. In the PAO1 system, lasI and rhlI are involved in autoinducer synthesis, while lasR and rhlR code for transcriptional activators (Sharma et al., 2014) . In our study, the expression of lasB, lasI, lasR, rhlI and rhlR was reduced considerably (Fig. 7B) , thus indicating that the V. alginolyticus 12 extract is able to inhibit both the las-and rhl-regulatory systems. This also points to a plausible mechanism for its QSI activity, perhaps through Fig. 7 . A. The violacein Inhibitory activity analysis.

(2007) achieved a similar result to ours with Kigelia africana extracts. In addition to its antibiofilm activity, our extract also inhibited the production of P. aeruginosa AI-2 factors, such as the pqs genes (Fig. 7B ). Our prior work had revealed the inhibition of elastase activity and siderophore production by Rhizobium spp. NAO1 occurs via interference with QS activity, because these virulence factors are under the control of the lasI-lasR and rhlI-rhlR systems (Chang et al., 2017) . Overall, these studies suggest that the potential target (rhodamine isothiocyanate) exhibits QSI activity against P. aeruginosa PAO 1 via a significant reduction in the QS cascades via downregulated AI-1 or AI-2 genes.",

Based on our results, we propose a model, shown in Fig. 8 , to explain the transcriptional regulation of QSI in P. aeruginosa. It is possible to infer that the QSI effect in the C. violaceum 12472 systems, with rhodamine isothiocyanate or its analogue, may be mediated by interference with the synthesis or activity of AHL molecules. This model indicates that the target compound would disrupt the las and rhl pathways, there by influencing protein activities downstream (such as the function of protease, elastase, pyocyanin and rhamnolipid), eventually reducing the production of biofilm in combination with the pqs pathway. Indeed, we saw a reduction in elastase activity and rhamnolipid production (Fig. 4) , thus providing supporting evidence for our model. Therefore, QSI activity can arise from a combination of two mechanisms: interference with the activity of CV12472 to produce AHLs by the LuxR system and modulation of AHL synthesis by the LuxI system. In addition, V. alginolyticus 12 has the potential to reduce the virulence of P. aeruginosa by interfering with the appropriate production of AI-2 factors (such as pqs genes).",

(2002) pointed out that swimming motility in P. aeruginosa was not regulated by QS molecular. Based on this, we speculated that besides QS signals, the target compound (or other activity substance in the extract) probably has a globally role to regulate biofilm formation factors in PAO 1, such as vfr, rpoN, small RNAs (rsmYZ) and cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) regulator (Yuan et al., 2015) (the dotted circle in Fig. 8 ).

The analogue molecule(s) of rhodamine isothiocyanate may have disrupted the AI system in P. aeruginosa; confocal microscopy confirmed that the P. aeruginosa biofilm featured a reduced thickness and biomass. Our qRT-PCR analysis suggested an underlying molecular mechanism that affected functional genes involved in the formation of biofilms and virulence production. Interestingly, the extract did not reduce the growth of P. aeruginosa. These findings may facilitate the discovery of novel antifouling agents with greater efficacy against biofouling. Further studies are now underway in our laboratory to develop a cartridge delivery system.",

At this time, approximately 10 ll of extract (concentration: 10 lg ml \u00c01 ) of strain H12 was added to the PAO1 culture medium to form the treatment groups. The extract was dissolved in methanol [to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) methanol]. The group receiving only 10 ll of methanol acted as the solvent control. After 24-36 h, total RNAs were extracted from the control and treated P. aeruginosa with TRIzol (Takara, Dalian, China) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was first checked by measuring A 260 /A 280 and A 260 /A 230 and then assessed by gel electrophoresis, before performing quantitative real-time PCR. The primers were designed using Primer Express v3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA): 35 cycles were run with denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 60\u00b0C for 45 s. The 16S rRNA gene was used as a control for standardization. Eight reported functional genes coding for QS regulation activity were chosen for these PCR analyses. Their corresponding primers are listed in Table S2 . A melt-curve analysis was performed to validate the specificity of the qRT-PCR reaction. The relative transcription level of each gene was defined as the ratio of its transcripts obtained in biofilms grown under a given concentration of compounds over those obtained in LB medium with methanol, for which the 2 \u00c0DDCt 2 \u00c0\u0394\u0394Ct method was applied (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) .",

The absence of purple, or the formation of pigment inhibition, was considered indicative of potential QSI positive isolates. The test samples (red arrows, T2, T5, T8, T16 and T18) point to the positive QSI strains and pigment inhibition can be observed on a clear background on the plate.

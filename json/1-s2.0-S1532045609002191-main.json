    "abstract": "Copper is a common marine pollutant yet its effects on symbiotic cnidarians are largely understudied. To further understand the impact of elevated copper concentrations on marine symbiotic organisms, toxicity tests were conducted using the model sea anemone, Aiptasia pallida, with and without its zooxanthellae symbiont. Symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida were exposed to sublethal copper concentrations (0, 5, 15, and 50 \u00b5g/L) for 7 d and copper accumulation, behavior, and the activity of the oxidative stress enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were measured. Additionally, acute 96-h toxicity tests were conducted to determine LC values of the organisms after copper exposure. Both symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida rapidly accumulated copper in a time and dose dependent manner. However, higher copper concentrations accumulated in the aposymbiotic as compared to the symbiotic A. pallida. In response to the highest two copper exposures (15 and 50 \u00b5g/L) symbiotic A. pallida upregulated CAT activity to combat the damaging effects of hydrogen peroxide. Contrary to these results, SOD activity significantly decreased during the highest copper exposure, when compared to controls. CAT activity was not detected and SOD was substantially (N10 fold) reduced in aposymbiotic A. pallida, suggesting that the zooxanthellae are associated with the oxidative stress response. Copper exposure as low as 5 \u00b5g/L caused tentacle retraction and increased mucus production in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones. The LC values for symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida exposed to copper for 96 h were 148 \u00b5g/L (95% confidence interval= 126.4, 173.8) and 206 \u00b5g/L (95% confidence interval=175.2, 242.2), respectively. Understanding the varying responses of symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida to copper stress may advance our comprehension of the functional roles of zooxanthellae and host. Although the mechanism of copper toxicity has not been fully elucidated, it is clear that A. pallida accumulate copper and are sensitive, as effects were detected at environmentally relevant copper concentrations. Likewise, A. pallida may be useful in biomonitoring copper polluted environments. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

These symbiotic cnidarians reside on rocks, mangrove roots, coral, and other hard substrates in near shore, shallow coastal waters (Kaplan, 1988) . Due to their close proximity to anthropogenic inputs, A. pallida may be a bioindicator of copper pollution. Healthy A. pallida are golden-brown in color due to their zooxanthellae (dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium), which live in symbiosis with A. pallida (Cook et al., 1988) . Zooxanthellae provide the anemone with photosynthate via carbon fixation pathways. In return, A. pallida, provide the zooxanthellae with nutrients (nitrogenous waste and CO 2 ) and protection (Cook et al., 1988) . When this host-symbiont relationship becomes challenged by any number of environmental stressors, loss of the symbiont \"bleaching\" may occur (Brown, 2000) .",

Harland and Nganro (1990) suggested that the pattern of copper accumulation in the tissues of symbiotic cnidarians may be influenced by the presence of the symbiont. These researchers showed that copper accumulation in the symbiotic sea anemone, Anemonia viridis, was not directly reflective of the copper concentrations in the environment, suggesting that detoxification and excretion mechanisms were used to combat increasing copper concentrations (Harland and Nganro, 1990) . They suggested that copper accumulated to a greater extent in the zooxanthellae than host tissue and in a final detoxification attempt the anemone released their symbiotic algae to reduce internal copper concentrations (Harland and Nganro, 1990) . The concept of zooxanthellae expulsion as a mechanism of metal detoxification has been suggested by several researchers, since zooxanthellae have been found to accumulate heavy metals to a larger extent and be more tolerant than their symbiotic hosts (Peters et al., 1997; Jones, 2004) .",

                "text": "In many aquatic organisms, the accumulation of copper is typically associated with oxidative stress and subsequent macromolecular damage. The principle mechanism of copper toxicity involves the Haber-Weiss (Fenton) reaction (Gledhill et al., 1997) . The oxidation of copper (I) in the Fenton reaction drives the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxide and hydroxyl radical (Klaassen, 1996) . Copper can also react with superoxide anion to produce oxygen radicals (Craig et al., 2007) . In times of increased abiotic stress, electron transport mechanisms (i.e., photosystems and mitochondrial transport chains) become less efficient. In turn, free electrons are more likely to interact with diatomic molecular oxygen ultimately resulting in a series of reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Due to photosynthesis, symbiotic anemones are subjected to very high levels of oxygen during the day and at night they experience a hypoxic internal environment (Plantivaux et al., 2004) . This continuous transition between extreme oxygen environments can result in the increased production of ROS (Dykens et al., 1992; Nii and Muscatine, 1997) . ROS can denature proteins, mutate DNA, and cause lipid peroxidation (Klaassen, 1996; Richier et al., 2005) . To neutralize the potentially harmful effects of ROS, anemones produce enzymes such as SOD and CAT. SOD catalyzes the conversion of superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen; whereas CAT catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.",

Likewise, aposymbiotic A. pallida exposed to 50 \u00b5g/L copper, had a significant elevation in copper accumulation at 24 h, and their tissue copper continued to increase throughout the experiment (Fig. 1B) .",

The 96-h LC values for A. pallida were within the range of other reported acute copper toxicity values for marine organisms; however, some marine species have been shown to be more acutely sensitive to copper. Brown (2000) reported a 96 h LC of 10 \u00b5g/L copper for the coral, Montipora verrucosa and a 48-h LC of 50 \u00b5g/L copper for the anemone, Heteractis malu. After 96 h waterborne copper exposure, the sea urchin, Diadema antillarum had an LC 50 of 25 \u00b5g/L (Bielmyer et al., 2005) . In this study, the LC value for symbiotic A. pallida was lower than the LC value of aposymbiotic A. pallida. Cnidarians symbionts are thought to supply much of the energy requirements of the host; therefore, we initially suspected that without a symbiont, A. pallida would be more susceptible to copper toxicity. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that zooxanthellae sequester metals and exhibit a higher tolerance to metals, possibly due to more efficient antioxidant mechanisms (Jones, 1997 (Jones, , 2004 . In this study, the zooxanthellae did not confer protection to A. pallida after acute copper exposure, possibly because they were responsible for much of the ROS production. A recent study demonstrated copper toxicity to the zooxanthellae symbionts of two coral species. Bielmyer et al. (in press ) reported a decrease in the effective quantum yield of photosystem II in the zooxanthellae of the corals, Acropora cervicornis and Pocillopora damicornis; however no negative effects were observed in the zooxanthellae in Montastraea faveolata after waterborne copper exposure. Additionally, the Symbiodinium in each coral species differed and each exhibited a distinct pattern of copper bioaccumulation (Bielmyer et al., in press) .",

SOD activity initially increased in the symbiotic A. pallida exposed to 5 \u00b5g/L copper for 24 h. This level of environmental copper may have simply been low enough for A. pallida to tolerate. However, excess copper appeared inhibitory and reduced SOD activity, as was observed in anemones that were exposed to both 15 and 50 \u00b5g/L copper throughout the rest of the 7 d experiment.

Because of copper accumulation and formation of hydroxyl radicals over the first 24 h, A. pallida likely produced more CAT to catalyze the conversion of H 2 O 2 to H 2 O and O 2 instead of hydroxyl radicals. The decrease in SOD activity in the higher copper treatments, suggests that SOD may not have been a significant defense mechanism against copper in this species. However, multiple isoforms of SOD and CAT exist, as do other ROS handling enzymes, such as ascorbate peroxidase (Weis, 2008) . The tripeptide glutathione may also aid in sequestration and detoxification of copper (Sunagawa et al., 2008; Weis, 2008) .

                "text": "The decrease in coloration in symbiotic cnidarians due to the loss of algae or reduction in photopigments has been a common area of study in symbiotic cnidarians because of the detrimental effects on the overall health of the host organism (Brown, 2000) . Bleaching not only occurs in times of thermal stress as has been described in both coral and anemone species (Gates et al., 1992; Glynn, 1993; Perez et al., 2001) but has also been shown to occur due to heavy metal exposure (Harland and Brown, 1989; Nganro, 1992; Jones, 1997 Jones, , 2004 Bielmyer et al., in press ). The loss of zooxanthellae due to thermal stress is known to reduce the effect of photosynthesis, mainly the hyperoxic internal environment (Glynn, 1993; Brown, 2000; Perez et al., 2001 ). Perez and Weis (2006) demonstrated that the free radical, nitric oxide, was produced by symbiotic A. pallida after exposure to elevated temperatures, which led to the collapse of the symbiosis. Further, they demonstrated that the host cell was a major source of nitric oxide during the exposure to elevated temperature, which facilitated a cytotoxic response and the release of the symbiotic algae (Perez and Weis, 2006) . Bleaching in cnidarians has also been demonstrated in response to heavy metal exposure (Harland and Nganro, 1990; Nganro, 1992; Brown, 2000; Bielmyer et al., in press ). Harland and Nganro (1990) demonstrated that in copper environments of 50 and 200 \u00b5g/L, expulsion or loss of zooxanthellae in A. viridis increased over time. Nganro (1992) further demonstrated that algal loss in A. viridis increased directly with ambient copper concentration. Another possible means of copper homeostasis is the production of mucus, which has been extensively studied in symbiotic cnidarians in response to stress (Bryan, 1974; Meikle et al., 1988; Harland and Nganro, 1990; Reichelt and Jones, 1994; Brown, 2000; Marshall, 2002; Mitchelmore et al., 2003 Mitchelmore et al., , 2007 . The secretion of mucus may prevent the uptake of copper, as suggested by Reichelt and Jones (1994) . The composition of mucus varies between organisms (Meikle et al., 1988) , suggesting that mucus may be species specific and serve different purposes. One such purpose of the production and release of mucus is to bind to toxic metals, as demonstrated by the mucus in the nematodes, Enoplus brevis and E. communis (Howell, 1982) . A. pallida might respond similarly, as increased mucus was observed surrounding anemones after 96 h of exposure to 15 and 50 \u00b5g/ L Cu in this study. By 7 d, the mucus had been detached from the organism. Additionally, the mucus production in the symbiotic anemones appeared to be higher than in the aposymbiotic anemones, consistent with the findings of Mitchelmore et al. (2003) . The zooxanthellae of scleractinian coral are known to greatly contribute to the mucus production by their host through the transfer of photosynthetically fixed carbon (Wild et al., 2004) . It is likely that the zooxanthellae of A. pallida also contribute to mucus production. The relatively lower mucus production in the aposymbiotic anemones in this experiment could account for the higher copper accumulation, as compared to symbiotic anemones.",

No significant increase in CAT activity or copper accumulation was observed between and 96 h in symbiotic A. pallida; however, mucus production was most noticeable during that time period in both 15 and 50 \u00b5g/L copper treatments. We suspect that mucus production is first increased as a means to prevent copper uptake and only when this system is overwhelmed will bleaching occur, as bleaching was only observed in the highest copper concentrations at 7 d. Likewise, after 96 h, the anemones likely diverted energy to the formation of CAT as a defense against copper toxicity. The low levels of SOD and CAT and high copper accumulation in aposymbiotic A. pallida observed in this study provide support for the increased susceptibility of stressed or bleached cnidarians to low copper concentrations.",

Symbiotic A. pallida responded to the increased copper concentrations by decreasing SOD activity yet concomitantly increasing CAT activity. The activity of these ROS handling enzymes was substantially reduced in aposymbiotic A. pallida suggesting that the symbiont is most certainly involved in this defense mechanism. In response to increased copper, both symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones exhibited tentacle retraction and increased mucus production; however, the response appeared greater in symbiotic anemones. At low copper concentrations, the presence of the symbiont seemed advantageous in combating sublethal copper toxicity; however, at high levels of copper exposure, symbiotic anemones were more sensitive to lethal copper toxicity. At higher copper exposure, the zooxanthellae may have been producing excess ROS, which damage the host and potentially disrupt the symbiotic relationship; though further investigation is needed.",

The mechanism of copper toxicity has not been fully elucidated, but it is clear that A. pallida accumulate copper, are sensitive to sublethal copper toxicity, and may be useful in biomonitoring copper polluted environments. This study provides more evidence that the symbiotic relationship in cnidarians is important in dealing with copper stress and may provide insight into the overall health of a coastal ecosystem impacted by copper.",

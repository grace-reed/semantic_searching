                "text": "Meiosis is complex, as after replication of a diploid genome to make sister chromatids of each DNA molecule, the cell divides the genetic material twice. The first is a reductive cell division, in which pairs of homologous chromosomes are separated into two different haploid daughter cells. Each of these two daughters then separates the sister chromatids, using a mechanism essentially identical to a mitotic cell division, to produce four gametes. The independent segregation of homologous chromosomes, coupled with crossing-over events that occur during prophase of the first meiotic division, generates a population of gametes with an high genetic diversity. A hypothesis to explain the pervasiveness of meiosis among organisms is that the resulting increase in genetic diversity allows populations to better resist parasitic infections -this hypothesis is supported by both observations of natural populations and laboratory experiments (Lively and Morran 2014).",

It is clear that at least some dinoflagellate species are able to undergo meiosis. In Lingulodinium, fusion between two haploid gametes of different sexual types leads to formation of a diploid cell called a hypnozygote, which can form either resting cysts (under nutrient deficiency) or sexual cysts (formed in nutrient replete conditions) (Bravo and Figueroa 2014) . Lingulodinium was also used for mating experiments between clonal lines to show the presence of only two sexual types (Figueroa and Bravo 2005) . In Alexandrium, 4C cells were identified cells using imaging flow cytometry (Figueroa et al. 2015) . In older studies with Peridinium, hypnozygotes with four nuclei following gamete fusion were reported (Pfiester 1976) , and two successive divisions of a planozygote, suggestive of meiosis were reported in several species (von Stosch 1973) . However, it is far from clear that all species are capable of sex, including the coral symbiont Symbiodinium. Symbiodinium has come under increased scrutiny because meiotic recombination may augment the functional diversity of symbionts and produce some strains more resistant to coral bleaching (Suggett et al. 2017) .",

Similarity in gene content on the other hand would suggest the dinoflagellates are as likely to undergo meiosis as are the apicomplexans Furthermore, both show considerable similarity to other protists where meiosis has also been documented.

Second, some elements of the cohesin complex holding homologous chromosomes together (Rec8p and Irr1p) are absent. This may suggest that dinoflagellate chromosomes also require alternative partners to Smc1p/Smc3p in the cohesin complex, although again, these two sequences are also absent in the majority of the other protists tested (Supplementary Material Table S1 ). Lastly, elements of the pachytene checkpoint, in particular the synapsis proteins Hop1p and Red1p, as well as the Sum1p transcription factor activated by them, are not present.

To assess how well gene presence in S. kawagutii reflected what is observed in other protists, the subset of genes whose products are involved in recombination was also used to query apicomplexan, ciliate and diatom databases. The results of this analysis (Fig. 2) are presented as a heat map, where the colors pass from yellow to red with a lowering of the e-value (e-values of 0 were arbitrarily set at e -200 to allow them to be presented graphically). Absent genes lack color. The different genes are ordered according to an increase in similarity with the budding yeast query to the fission yeast database (leftmost column). We observe here that the degree of similarity to budding yeast genes in BLAST searches is very similar between the different protists. Other than the apicomplexans, most of the protists surveyed have roughly 50% of the budding yeast meiotic gene repertoire, while fission yeast has genes similar to 66% of the budding yeast gene repertoire (Table 1 ). In particular, the similarity between Symbiodinium gene inventories and what is observed with the other protists clearly supports the notion that the recombination machinery is sufficient to support meiosis in this dinoflagellate.",

Among these, the only highly conserved gene is the topoisomerase (Top1), as the Mnd1 gene has only a weak similarity to the yeast query. However, this is a characteristic shared by all other protists tested ( Supplementary Material Fig. S1 ), and is thus unlikely to reflect any adaptations to the particularities of dinoflagellate chromosomes (Wong 2019) . The genes encoding structural maintenance of chromosomes (Smc) proteins, ATPases that act as either cohesins (Smc1 and Smc3) or condensins (Smc2 and Smc4), were not listed as part of the synaptonemal complex, but are present and highly conserved over all the organisms surveyed ( Supplementary Material Fig. S2 ).",

In some cases, all complex components are present (such as Msh2-Msh6 or Msh4-Msh5), while in another, entire complexes are absent (such as the complex containing Rec107, or that containing Csm2).

                "text": "There is increasing interest in the possibility of sexual recombination in dinoflagellates, especially those symbiotic with coral, since recombination may be able to augment genetic diversity and reduce levels of coral bleaching. Several previous studies have addressed this in Symbiodinium by querying sequence databanks with a list of 51 genes termed a meiosis detection toolkit. Here, we have constructed an expanded list of 307 genes involved in meiosis in budding yeast. We find the genes involved in the major regulatory steps in yeast meiosis are also found in dinoflagellates, as are many of the genes involved in recombination. In contrast, few genes involved in forming the synaptonemal complex or forming spores are conserved. We further note that the meiosis-related genes absent in dinoflagellates are also as a general rule absent from other protists in the closely related apicomplexa and the ciliates. We conclude the symbiotic dinoflagellates are as able to undergo meiosis as are other protists. Key words: Dinoflagellate; meiosis; conserved genes; Symbiodinium kawagutii; Fugacium kawagutii.",

It should be noted that the 31 of 51 genes found here in S. kawagutii are not all identical to the 31 of 51 genes found in S. minutum. Hop2, BRCA1, Ku80 and Sae2 were found in S. minutum but not in",

    "abstract": "The Antarctic pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica, is a dominant member of the zooplankton in the Ross Sea and supports the vast diversity of marine megafauna that designates this region as an internationally protected area. Here, we observed the response of respiration rate to abiotic stressors associated with global change-environmentally relevant temperature treatments (\u22120.8\u00b0C, 4\u00b0C) and pH treatments reflecting current-day and future modeled extremes (8.2, 7.95 and 7.7 pH at \u22120.8\u00b0C; 8.11, 7.95 and 7.7 pH at 4\u00b0C). Sampling repeatedly over a 14-day period in laboratory experiments and using microplate respirometry techniques, we found that the metabolic rate of juvenile pteropods increased in response to low-pH exposure (pH 7.7) at \u22120.8\u00b0C, a near-ambient temperature. Similarly, metabolic rate increased when pteropods were exposed simultaneously to multiple stressors: lowered pH conditions (pH 7.7) and a high temperature (4\u00b0C). Overall, the results showed that pCO 2 and temperature interact additively to affect metabolic rates in pteropods. Furthermore, we found that L. h. antarctica can tolerate acute exposure to temperatures far beyond its maximal habitat temperature. Overall, L. h. antarctica appears to be susceptible to pH and temperature stress, two abiotic stressors which are expected to be especially deleterious for ectothermic marine metazoans in polar seas.",

These organisms, often referred to as indicator species, can allow for a better understanding of global ocean conditions, especially in remote locations, as long as the species is well-studied in the context of these global stressors (Landres et al., 1988) . Certain animals may also act as valuable sentinel organisms, helping to indicate the first signs of GCC impacts on ecosystems (Bednar\u0161ek et al., 2014; Johnson and Hofmann, 2017; Manno et al., 2017) . For instance, thecosome pteropods possess a very fragile shell composed primarily of aragonite (Orr et al., 2005; Comeau et al., 2010) , a more soluble form of CaCO 3 that is particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification (OA) (Mucci, 1983; Comeau et al., 2010) . Previous studies have shown evidence of shell dissolution and malformations under future pCO 2 levels (Orr et al., 2005; Lischka et al., 2010) , which may adversely impact the shell's protective capacity against predators or infection, or the shell's ballast ability, which aids in vertical migration (Comeau et al., 2010) . Through this lens, the overarching goal of this study was to examine the response of an important member of the zooplankton in the Southern Ocean, the pteropod Limacina helicina antarctica, to temperature changes and simulated OA.",

In particular, the Southern Ocean has already warmed at a rate almost double that of the global trend in the upper 1000 m of ocean waters (0.17\u00b0C in the Southern Ocean between the 1950s and the 1980s) (Levitus et al., 2000; Gille, 2002; Fyfe, 2006) . Additionally, the surface waters of the Southern Ocean are inherently susceptible to OA due to the high solubility of gases in cold waters, with surface ocean undersaturation of aragonite (\u03a9 arag < 1) expected to develop by the year 2030 (McNeil and Matear, 2008; Hauri et al., 2016) . Considering these observed trends, understanding how Antarctic marine organisms respond to the combined impacts of warming and acidification is of paramount importance for predicting how these factors will impact the unique ecosystem that persists in the Southern Ocean (Boyd et al., 2016) .",

Indeed, larvae of the sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri, were found to be remarkably tolerant to OA and warming (Kapsenberg and Hofmann, 2014) , although other studies have shown sensitivity of calcification processes in early stages . Stress responses, however, can vary greatly by species (Byrne and Przeslawski, 2013; Breitburg et al., 2015; Przeslawski et al., 2015; Stillman and Armstrong, 2015) . Additionally, although variability in pH has been characterized across a variety of spatiotemporal scales (Hofmann et al., 2011) , the high seasonality of pH in Antarctic surface waters indicates the potential for spawning phenology of polar organisms to be a critical factor in assessing the exposure of early life stages to near-future OA (Kapsenberg et al., 2015) .",

Thecosome pteropods are a key study organism in polar regions, holding an essential role in food web dynamics and energy transfer (Willette et al., 2001; Hunt et al., 2008; Bednar\u0161ek et al., 2012) by acting as major consumers of phytoplankton (Perissinotto, 1991; Bernard and Froneman, 2009) while serving as prey for a variety of organisms, including gymnosome pteropods, euphausids, salps, and a multitude of pelagic and demersal fish species (Lancraft et al., 1991; Hunt et al., 2008) . As such, L. h. antarctica is a key player in the simple, yet fragile Antarctic food web and directly impacts the food sources of higher trophic levels, including predatory birds and mammals, such as penguins, whales and seals (Davis et al., 1999; Seibel and Dierssen, 2003; McClintock et al., 2008) . Thecosome pteropods also play a sizeable role in geochemical cycling of both organic and inorganic carbon, producing fecal pellets and calcium carbonate (CaCO ) shells that sink to deeper waters (Berner and Honjo, 1981; Fabry, 1990; Gilmer and Harbison, 1991; Collier et al., 2000; Tsurumi et al., 2005; Manno et al., 2009) . Manno et al. (2009) estimated that L. h. antarctica could contribute as much as 72% of the total organic carbon export in the Ross Sea, and Honjo (2004) found that south of the Polar Front, pteropods were the main contributor to an inorganic CaCO flux of 110 mmol C m \u22122 yr \u22121 . Overall, L. h. antarctica holds a key role in Southern Ocean ecosystems, but unfortunately, changing ocean temperatures and pH levels may adversely impact this species. Due to this considerable abundance and ecological importance of L. h. antarctica in the Southern Ocean, as well as its potential vulnerabilities to elevated temperatures and pCO 2 levels, it is critical to investigate how this species copes with multiple abiotic stressors and consequently, the capacity of these populations to withstand dynamic environmental change.",

However, other organisms, such as sea urchin larvae, have been shown to respond to these same two stressors antagonistically when the negative effects of one stressor are offset by the other (Sheppard Brennand et al., 2010) . Lastly, the two stressors may exacerbate one another, resulting in a synergistic interaction effect between stressors as has been observed in the Arctic pteropod (Lischka and Riebesell, 2012) . Understanding the interaction of environmentally co-occurring stressors in sentinel species, especially in areas of the world's oceans potentially most vulnerable to global change, is thus a key research priority in global change biology.",

Interrogating metabolic rate as a proxy for organismal energy dynamics is a useful strategy in global change studies and can provide valuable insight into physiological state (Sokolova, 2013) . Hypothetically, under OA stress alone, pteropods may increase their metabolism to support shell repair, or to maintain calcification under elevated pCO 2 conditions. In addition to shell effects, elevated pCO 2 levels can also alter physiology by interacting with internal and external body fluids, causing acid-base imbalances and reduced capacity for oxygen transport (Fabry et al., 2008; Melzner et al., 2009; O'Donnell et al., 2010) . Metabolic suppression has been identified as an adaptive mechanism by which some organisms cope with hypercapnia, but prolonged metabolic suppression will have consequences on growth and survival (Fabry et al., 2008; Dymowska et al., 2012) . In contrast, some species appear to respond to OA by increasing their metabolic rates, although this comes at an energetic cost (Wood et al., 2008; Stumpp et al., 2011) . Increased temperatures will also increase metabolic rates due to enzyme kinetics based on the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model (Dell et al., 2011) , which may interact with the consequences of a high pCO 2 environment (Gunderson et al., 2016) .",

L. h. antarctica have a lifespan of 1-3 or more years (Hunt et al., 2008; Bednar\u0161ek et al., 2012) in which juveniles overwinter before maturing into adults in the early summer (Gannefors et al., 2005; Hunt et al., 2008) . Overwintering juveniles may be especially susceptible to elevated pCO 2 levels and temperatures because, during the wintertime when algal food supplies are limited, polar organisms are known to lower their metabolism as a means of conserving energy (Hirche, 1996; Hagen and Auel, 2001 ), possibly decreasing their resistance to abiotic stressors (Lischka et al., 2010) . Maas et al. (2011) demonstrated that L. h. antarctica lowered its metabolic rate, measured by a decrease in oxygen consumption, under conditions of reduced food availability. Over the winter, the Arctic pteropod subspecies, L. helicina helicina, temporarily stops growing, perhaps lowering its activity and calcification processes while relying on internal lipid stores (Lischka and Riebesell, 2012) . Metabolic suppression may decrease an organism's ability to cope with OA and/or warming, or else metabolism must be increased in order to respond, effectively forcing the use of energy reserves at a time when conserving energy is a necessity (Lischka and Riebesell, 2012) . Thus, research on juvenile L. h. antarctica provides valuable information on what is potentially its most vulnerable life history stage (Manno et al., 2017) .",

Using a microplate respirometry system, oxygen consumption measurements were recorded during 2-week exposures to a combination of three pCO 2 levels and two temperatures chosen to reflect current and predicted future ocean conditions during both winter and summer seasons in this region. Additionally, oxygen consumption rates were measured along a range of elevated temperatures to determine the critical thermal maxima (CT max ).

These reservoirs were held in a sea table that kept the treated seawater at the desired experimental temperature (~\u22120.8\u00b0C for E1 and~4\u00b0C for E2) to represent the current average temperature and an elevated temperature based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, the scenario that represents the highest greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2013 , Moss et al., 2010 , Riahi et al., 2011 . The pCO 2 treated seawater was then pumped into the zooplankton flow-through culturing system. Acidification treatments were chosen to represent the range of current monthly means of pH in McMurdo Sound (measured 2 km away from the pteropod collection site), as well as modeled end-of-century pH based on an equilibrium model (Kapsenberg et al., 2015) . Target pH values for E1 were 8.2 (a low pCO 2 treatment of~264 \u03bcatm, representing the average pH of the current highest-pH month), 7.95 (a mid pCO treatment of~500 \u03bcatm, representing both the average pH of the current lowest-pH month, as well as the average pH of the future highest-pH month) and 7.7 (a high pCO 2 treatment of~920 \u03bcatm, representing the average pH of the future lowest-pH month) ( Table 1) . Target pH values for E2 were equivalent to those of E1 for the mid and high pCO 2 treatments; however, the low treatment was set at 8.11 pH units (~337 \u03bcatm) because the 8.2 pH value from E1 at 4\u00b0C resulted in an environmentally improbable pCO 2 value (~265 \u03bcatm).",

Culture vessels were created by modifying clear 1-liter polycarbonate plastic tanks, accompanying lids and 400 \u03bcm mesh baffles that are often used in zebrafish research (Model AHLT3, Pentair Aquatic Ecosystems, Cary, NC, USA). To ensure that the animals were exposed to a continuous flow of pCO 2 treated seawater, water input was regulated using irrigation button drippers (W221B, DIG Irrigation Products, Vista, CA, USA), at a flow rate of 2 liters per hour. The volume of one vessel was replaced on a 20-min basis. As a result, the pCO 2 levels in the replicate culture vessels were highly similar within a treatment and tracked the reservoir pCO 2 concentrations closely (see Results, Fig. 1 ). For each experiment, approximately 400 pteropods were randomly selected and added to each of the culture vessels. Only actively swimming individuals were taken for experiments.

Each respirometry plate contained 24 closed-cell glass chambers with a 200 \u03bcL capacity, with a PreSens oxygen spot (PreSens, Regensburg, Germany) at the base of each chamber. Each plate was calibrated at two oxygen concentrations: 100% (aerated seawater) and 0% (1% Na 2 SO 3 in milli-Q) at 2\u00b0C. All measured oxygen values were temperature-corrected to this calibration. At each timepoint, each plate was submerged in seawater (pCO 2 -treated water for E1 and E2, ambient seawater for E3), and a plastic transfer pipet was used to remove any visible air bubbles from the plate chambers. A single, visibly swimming pteropod was carefully added to a chamber using a transfer pipet, and the chamber was quickly sealed with a screw-on plastic cap lined with a PTFE seal. Care was taken to eliminate air bubbles from the plastic caps during the capping process. Six chambers per plate, spread across multiple rows and columns, were filled with only treatment seawater and were used as blanks to account for any background respiration due to microbial activity. In E1 and E2, the three plates were randomly assigned to a treatment in each timepoint to avoid any potential differences between plate calibrations (i.e. plate effects). Once every respirometry chamber was filled and sealed, each plate was then submerged in a flow-through acrylic water bath (Model CH10505, Loligo Systems) connected to a larger, temperature-controlled tank via a pump (Model MD7, Danner Manufacturing Inc, Islandia, NY, USA) that was held at the desired experiment temperature with a heat pump (IsoTemp 730, Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Although the temperatures were held as accurately as possible, the heat in the laboratory limited the lowest temperature of the respirometry system to \u22120.6\u00b0C for E1. Thus, for E1, respirometry was conducted 0.2\u00b0C higher than the experimental exposure temperature.",

Following the oxygen measurements, pteropods were carefully removed and stored at \u22121\u00b0C until they were weighed.

There was a significantly different scaling coefficient between timepoints (ANCOVA, P = 0.003), but not between treatments (ANCOVA, P = 0.321), likely due to a change in dry weight over time. Thus, different scaling coefficients were derived for each timepoint in each experiment (E1 and E2), and used to correct pteropod respiration rates separately for each respective timepoint and treatment. Pteropod respiration rates were mass-corrected using the mean mass in each experiment (145.76 mg in E1, 142.21 \u00b5g in E2) using masscorrection equations from Steffensen et al. (1994) .

This increase in metabolic rate is consistent with a bioenergetic outcome with increased costs of maintenance (Sokolova, 2013) , possibly due to L. h. antarctica's ability to self-repair its shell from the inside by secreting aragonite in response to physical scarring caused by undersaturation (Peck et al., 2016) . As the shell's function is to protect the pteropods, as well as to help regulate their buoyancy, its repair is a critical component of their energy budget under future undersaturated conditions of OA, and evidence of dissolution on shells has been documented on Antarctic pteropods collected from the wild (Johnson et al., 2016) . The increase in metabolic rate as a response to high pCO 2 may also be due to increased energetic demand for acid-base balance (Sokolova, 2013) , which may be critical in providing an internal environment for this critical aragonite shell repair.",

The effect of elevated CO 2 did not change drastically between temperature treatments (high pCO 2 treated organisms had 1.112-fold higher respiration rates in E1, and 1.081-fold higher respiration rates in E2 when compared to low pCO 2 -treated organisms). These trends designate the observed interaction as additive-where the sum effect of two stressors is equal to the sum of the effects of the individual stressors. In contrast, antagonistic effects yield an effect less than the sum of the individual stressors, while synergistic effects yield an effect greater than the sum of the individual stressors (Fig. 6) .

Although dry weights of sampled pteropods were significantly different between treatments by the end of E2, as there was no difference in the scaling coefficient (ANCOVA, P = 0.321) between treatments, scaling coefficients were calculated discretely for each timepoint of each experiment, then applied to correct the respiration rate to an average body mass for each experiment.",

In studies on early stage Antarctic dragonfish, Gymnodraco acuticeps, increased temperature significantly increased development rates and embryonic metabolic rate (Flynn et al., 2015) . However, although pCO 2 stress alone did not negatively affect embryo physiology, there was a synergistic interaction when embryos were exposed to both high pCO 2 and high temperature. Similarly, a study rearing larvae of the sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri, in pCO 2 and temperature treatments found that there was no effect of either individual stressor on the ability to withstand acute larval heat stress (Kapsenberg and Hofmann, 2014) . However, rearing urchin larvae at both high pCO 2 and high temperature resulted in a decreased ability to tolerate acute heat stress at certain early developmental stages. Overall, studies seem to indicate that multistressor relationships in the Antarctic can vary between species, and that this interaction can occasionally make certain species less vulnerable to experimental conditions of ocean change than previous studies have suggested (Peck, 2005) .",

In the northern hemisphere, studies collecting pteropods from Kongsfjord, Spitsbergen have found varying effects of pCO 2 and temperature based on collection time, species and acclimation duration. Specifically, Lischka and colleagues generally found an increase in MO with increasing temperature and pCO 2 in acute exposures of L. h. helicina collected in January and February, with the exception of the highest-temperature (6.8\u00b0C), where an intermediate pCO 2 (650, out of a range of 180-880) caused the highest increase in metabolism (Lischka and Riebesell, 2017) . This 'hormesis-type' effect, where an intermediate treatment yielded the highest metabolic increase, was prominent at all temperatures during the paired 9-day acclimation experiment. In contrast, L. h. helicina collected from the same site in May-June showed no metabolic response to pCO 2 manipulation at ambient temperature (0\u00b0C), but there was an observed increase in respiration rate when increasing pCO 2 at high temperature (4\u00b0C) after a 24-h incubation (Comeau et al., 2010) . The hormesis-type effect described in Lischka and Riebesell (2017) was not observed in our study in either experiment. However, Lischka and Riebesell (2017) also observed different multistressor effects in the congener L. retroversa collected at the same site, which did not exhibit any interaction between temperature and pCO 2 effects. Altogether, these studies in the Arctic show marked differences in pteropod response to these multistressor conditions at different acclimation durations and collection times-even in closely related species. Specifically, the seasonal differences are likely a situation that, while not unique to polar ecosystems, may be strengthened there due to the strong seasonality experienced at high latitudes compounded by the collection of different life history stages at different times of the year.",

While Seibel and colleagues collected L. h. antarctica near our collection site (the three sites are 25 km, 35 km and 75 km north), they were collected far later in the austral summer. This is reflected in the pteropod mass-the pteropods collected for E1 and E2 in October and November 2015 (0.05-0.95 mg) for our study were less than 10% of the mass of those collected by . Although seasonal development of pteropods in the Antarctic is poorly documented, this growth spurt coincides with phytoplankton blooms in the Ross Sea region (Goffart et al., 1999) . This corroborates previous studies that suggest L. h. antarctica potentially exhibit a 1year life cycle, spawning and senescing in late summer (Hunt et al., 2008) . The fact that this phytoplankton bloom plays a large part in pteropod phenology, growth and development is supported by Seibel et al.'s disparate results between replicate experiments conducted in consecutive years, which is hypothesized to be a function of low ocean chlorophyll abundance already suppressing metabolism in the second year of trials. Given that phenology and interactions with seasonality have been seen as key factors in governing the Arctic pteropod's response to pCO 2 and temperature, we posit that these factors drove the differences between the results in this study and that of Seibel and colleagues.",

This is most likely caused by the stark seasonal day/ night cycles at high latitudes, which result in 24-h darkness during the winter and 24-h daylight during the summer. Considering the high pH seasonality in the Ross Sea region, it is probable that pteropods at different life stages during a different time of year will exhibit a disparate response to pCO stress. Furthermore, different life stages will experience different magnitudes and duration of pCO 2 stress, both of which have been seen as critical factors in determining calcification capacity in pteropods collected from the wild in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (Bednars\u011bk et al., 2017) . This highlights the importance of considering life stage, phenology and currentday seasonal variation of abiotic stressors when studying global change biology, as impacts during juvenile stages may also be difficult to recover from (Hettinger et al., 2012 , Manno et al., 2017 . If hypercapnia elicits a different response at different life stages, the seasonal trend of pH in McMurdo Sound may play an integral part in this organism's future viability under environmental change.",

Emergent examples of this are scenarios of OA and thermal stress in coral reef ecosystems (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007) or persistently covarying stressors like OA and hypoxia in temperate kelp forest ecosystems (Frieder et al., 2012) . Further study of the energetics of marine organisms in response to potentially interacting abiotic factors may lend additional insight into understanding the vulnerability of species to future ocean change. Eventually, investigating the root cause and patterns that lead to certain species exhibiting additive effects may not only allow for a better understanding of stress physiology, but may also allow for a critical, more accurate glimpse of future community dynamics in a changing world.",

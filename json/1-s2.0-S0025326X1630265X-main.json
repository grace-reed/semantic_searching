                "text": "Coral reefs are usually surrounded by oligotrophic, nutrient poor, water systems where productivity rarely exceeds 0.01 g of fixed carbon m \u22122 day \u22121 (Hatcher, 1988) . However, productivity within coral tissue can reach 40 g of fixed carbon m \u22122 day \u2212 1 (Hatcher, 1988; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999) . This makes coral reefs one of the most productive systems on Earth, due to the unique relationship between the corals and their algal symbionts, commonly known as zooxanthellae, which are responsible for 50-70% of the total primary production in most reefs (D'Angelo and Wiedenmann, 2014) . The zooxanthellae are unicellular dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium (Rowan and Powers, 1991a; Baker, 1999; Carlos et al., 1999; Goulet, 2006) and provide the coral host with up to 95% of their own metabolites such as glycerol, glucose, alanine and organic acids necessary for coral productivity and growth Powers, 1991a, 1991b; Pochon et al., 2004) . In return, the coral provides the Symbiodinium with urea, amino acids, glycerophosphate and CO 2 needed by the algae for photosynthesis (Hackett et al., 2004) . Furthermore, the hard coral structure provides the endosymbionts with protection against grazing and sedimentation, while the mucus production and sloughing process carried by the coral themselves prevent sediments from accumulating on the coral surface, hence hindering light from reaching the endosymbionts (Rogers, 1990) . Historically, the symbiotic dinoflagellates in corals probably evolved from nonsymbiotic dinoflagellates (Rowan, 1998) . The symbiotic relationship starts when the newly formed coral colony acquires the photosynthetic symbiont from the surrounding environment or from the eggs, depending entirely on the reproduction mode of each coral species (Thornhill et al., 2006) .",

Baker and Romanski (2007) reported that more than 50% of scleractinian corals (250 species) can host more than one Symbiodinium clade and that diverse symbionts can be found within the same clade; this is contrary to the conclusion of Goulet (2006) who suggested that 77% of the 442 scleractinian and octocorals species host a single Symbiodinium clade and only 23% host multiple clades. The findings of Baker and Romanski (2007) are widely accepted, and it is believed that the corals harboring multiple clades can change the symbiont type according to the prevailing conditions. Different environmental factors both regulate the distribution and determine the type of Symbiodinium clades inhabiting the coral tissue (Van Oppen et al., 2001; Goulet and Coffroth, 2003) . Therefore, sclerectinian corals can flexibly associate with assorted symbionts with diverse physiologies which can confer better resistance to extreme environmental conditions (Baker, 2003; Baker et al., 2004; Berkelmans and Van Oppen, 2006) .",

Coral reefs found in the Arabian Gulf are regularly exposed to large variations in water temperature, ranging from 11\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C (Coles and Riegl, 2012) . There have been some key research results concerning adaptation strategies associated with coral reefs in the warm waters of the Arabian Gulf (see Riegl and Purkis, 2012) . Coral studies from Saudi Arabia (Baker et al., 2004) , Iran (Mostafavi et al., 2007; Shahhosseiny et al., 2011) and Abu Dhabi (Hume et al., 2013) suggest that Symbiodinium clades A, C and D are present in the Gulf corals. While Baker et al. (2004) , Mostafavi et al. (2007) and Shahhosseiny et al. (2011) showed the predominance of the thermotolerant clade D in the corals they investigated, Hume et al. (2013) showed the predominance of clade C3 in 7 thermotolerant reef builders in Abu Dhabi corals. Hume et al. (2013) suggested that clade D may be partially responsible for the resilience of the Gulf corals. Recently, Symbiodinium thermophilum clade C3 was identified as the most prevalent clade found in Abu Dhabi corals (Hume et al., 2015) .",

No information is available about the type of Symbiodinium that is present in these coral reefs, which regularly experience temperatures above 30\u00b0C. Coral reefs are found south of Kuwait across an inshore to offshore gradient. Inshore coral reefs are relatively small in size and occur in shallow waters of depths between 3 and 8 m, while offshore coral reefs can be found at depths reaching 30 m. Corals in Kuwait reefs are exposed to unique conditions; they experience one of the highest annual temperature variations with temperatures of more than 36\u00b0C in the summer (Al-Yamani et al., 2004) and low temperatures of 9\u00b0C in the winter (Spalding et al., 2001) . Studies performed on corals from other parts of the world have shown that no other coral system on Earth could survive the prolonged high temperatures that the Kuwaiti and the Gulf corals experience regularly. Reports showed that the Great Barrier Reef corals bleached when water temperature exceeded a 10 day threshold of 30.8\u00b0C (Berkelmans et al., 2004) , while Caribbean corals (for example, Montastrea annulari) bleached when the temperature exceeded 32\u00b0C (Fitt and Warner, 1995) . Therefore, understanding the coral-Symbiodinium relationship may be useful to further clarify how Kuwait corals can adapt to the high variation in water temperature. The current study provides information about Symbiodinium diversity and abundance in Kuwait corals, and the results show both the predominance of clade C in 14 coral species sampled from inshore and offshore reef systems south of Kuwait and spatial and temporal variation in the Symbiodinium population.",

Seawater samples from 1 m away from the sampled coral colonies were collected in 1 l sterile polyethylene bottles to investigate the free-living Symbiodinium. All samples were packed on ice and returned to the laboratory for immediate processing.

The results showed different hosts harbored different numbers of symbionts, but the readings obtained from each coral species cannot be compared with other species because the Symbiodinium abundance was determined in a slurry made of coral tissue and skeletons. The variation in the tissue to skeleton ratio for each species causes difficulty in comparing various coral genera. However, the results do indicate the abundance of Symbiodinium-like cells in each coral investigated. C. microphthalma was found to harbor a high number of Symbiodinium-like cells in its tissue (i.e., 26.4 \u00d7 10 cell g \u2212 1 ) and mucus (i.e., 36.8 \u00d7 10 cell ml \u22121 ) (Fig. 3) . Coscinaraea columna was found to harbor a low number of Symbiodinium-like cells in their tissue (i.e., 8.14 \u00d7 10 cell g \u22121 ), while P. decussata harbored a low number of Symbiodinium-like cells in their mucus (i.e., 15.2 \u00d7 10 cell ml \u2212 1 ). Significantly higher numbers (t = 4.30, P b 0.001) of Symbiodinium-like cells were found in the coral mucus than in the coral tissue in all thirteen coral species.",

These findings are contrary to the findings of Drohan et al. (2005) who reported a reduction in the Symbiodinium-like cell density after increases in both temperature and light intensity, which damaged photosystem II in the symbionts. However, the high recorded numbers might be explained by a decrease in the symbiont densities at the end of the high temperature season and not during the season (Douglas, 2003) as the samples were collected during July and not at the end of August. The increase in the density of Symbiodinium recorded in the summer is likely to be related to an increase in the inorganic nitrogen level (i.e., nitrate and nitrite) in Kuwait seawater (Sakami, 2000) typically recorded during the summer months (Al-Yamani et al., 2004; Devlin et al., 2015; Lyons et al., 2015) . Moreover, P. daedalea coral tissue and mucus sampled from the Umm Al-Maradim offshore reef system in April 2008 was found to harbor significantly higher numbers of Symbiodinium than samples from the Qit'at Benaya inshore reef system. Greater thermal stability in offshore systems than in inshore systems (Venn et al., 2008) and higher allochthonous input of nutrients and pollutants affecting the Kuwait inshore systems explain such spatial variation in Symbiodinium abundance.",

Additionally, the mucus receives Symbiodinium that are repelled by the coral tissue in which they have a significant role in providing mucus-associated microbes with the oxygen necessary for respiration and with glycerides and wax esters necessary for metabolism. This latter suggestion is supported by the findings of Baghdasarian and Muscatine (2000) who demonstrated that healthy cnidarians expel actively dividing zooxanthellae cells in order to maintain a constant algal population density within the host.",

Amplification of different genetic regions, i.e., 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and ITS, facilitates testing for the presence of different Symbiodinium types in coral mucus and tissue. Except for P. daedalea, all tested corals harbored Symbiodinium clade C alone in the tissue and mucus. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) provides evidence that clade C dominated the clone library. At least 4 subclades could be recognized, and the majority clustered close to C2 type Symbiodinium. This is similar to the findings of Hume et al. (2013) that showed the presence of C3 and C15 members in F. pallida, C3 and C36 in P. daedalea and C3 and C21 in A. clathrata sampled from Abu Dhabi. Symbiodinium clade C is widely distributed in nature (Pochon et al., 2004) and includes many thermotolerant subclades, such as subclade C15, which predominated in warm habitat corals (LaJeunesse et al., 2003; Van Oppen et al., 2005; Fabricius et al., 2004) . On the other hand, non-thermotolerant clade C members were also found in association with corals that survive in warm environments due to the hosts' ability to modify the mechanism of thermotolerance among the holobionts. This may explain why Acropora tenuis associated with the non-thermotolerant subclade C1 is more thermotolerant than the Acropora millepora associated with the thermotolerant Symbiodinium clade D (Fabricius et al., 2004) .",

                "text": "The predominance of Symbiodinium clade C in Kuwaiti corals emphasizes the importance of this clade and supports the findings of Hume et al. (2013) , who reported the presence of clade C3 Symbiodinium in nine coral species sampled from Abu Dhabi waters. However, it contradicts the findings of Baker et al. (2004) , Mostafavi et al. (2007) and Shahhosseiny et al. (2011) , which indicate the dominance of clade D in the south and north of the Arabian Gulf. Clade D was described as resistant to thermal stress (Brown et al., 2002; Thornhill et al., 2006) and common on reefs routinely exposed to high temperatures (Baker et al., 2008) . The current study showed the presence of clade D only in seawater samples, but none of the tested coral tissue or mucus was found to harbor clade D. This observation supports the findings of Hume et al. (2013) who reported the absence of clade D from 7 coral species sampled from Abu Dhabi during the summer. They concluded that clade D did not proliferate under the extreme conditions that occur south of the Arabian Gulf. However, the presence of clade D in the water may indicate the importance of this clade to other marine invertebrates such as sea anemones and sponges. It may also reflect that in a thermally variable environment such as the Kuwait marine system, clade C may have a stronger role in stabilizing corals than clade D. P. daedalea was the only coral in the current study that harbored clades A, B and C in its tissue. Spring and autumn samples contained clades A, B, and C, while summer samples contained clades B and C. Corals in Kuwaiti seawater are known to bleach during the winter, when the seawater temperature drops dramatically below the optimum temperature at which the coral can grow. The coral flourish again in the spring and reach their optimum activity during the summer; hence the coral spawning season in Kuwait extends from May until August every year (Carpenter et al., 1997) . Therefore, the detection of clade A in coral tissue in the spring fits within the explanation provided by Douglas (2003) that Symbiodinium clade A is predominant in coral after bleaching, suggesting an adaptation of the coral for bleaching by a shift in the Symbiodinium community, in which it is expected that the physiology of the holobionts is stabilized under different environmental conditions (Burnett, 2002) . However, the reason that clade B was predominant in P. daedalea tissue sampled in the summer is vague, especially given that clade B is temperature-sensitive and photosynthetically insignificant and produces a low quality photosynthate in comparison with other Symbiodinium genotypes (Venn et al., 2008) . Therefore, the reason why P. daedalea retains this symbiont during the high temperature season cannot be explained, especially because none of the other tested corals was found to harbor this symbiont. However, Jones et al. (2008) reported that certain coral species revert to their thermally sensitive symbionts after recovery from bleaching. This is the first study to suggest the presence of clade B in Gulf corals using the RFLP and DGGE techniques; however, the prepared clone library failed to detect this type of Symbiodinium, but this could be attributed to the low number of clones processed.",

P. daedalea tissue sampled in April 2008 from Qit'at Benaya was found to harbor Symbiodinium clades B and C, while Umm Al-Maradim samples contained three genotypes, clades A, B and C. The results can be considered as a demonstration of the concept of an \"ecospecies\" (Buddemeier et al., 2004) in which a single coral species can be associated with different clade(s), as determined by the surrounding environment, to ensure the optimum physiological activity of the coral. However, Platygyra dadaela was the only coral that was shown to harbor clades A, B and C in our study and was also the only coral that was severely affected by a recent bleaching incident that took place in Kuwait in September 2015 (Anon, 2015). Reports from inshore and offshore reef systems in Kuwait showed that P. dadaela suffered 100% damage (Fig. S3 , Supplementary data) while the other coral species reported ranges between to 97%.",

Actinobacteria in marine environments are mostly found in association with higher organisms, such as fish, sponges, corals, molluscs, ascidians, seaweeds, and mangroves, and have kept attracting attention due to their ability to produce various bioactive compounds [2, 4] . Among the isolation sources for marine actinobacteria, substantial amounts of studies were devoted to sponges from which a wide range of actinobacterial species were found to produce intriguing natural products [5] . Corals, another large group of marine invertebrates, also harbor diverse symbiotic or associating microorganisms [6] . However, only a handful of natural products such, as strepchloritides [7] , nahuoic acids B-E [8] , and pteridic acids C-G [9] , were obtained from actinobacteria associated with soft corals. There is no report indeed on natural products from actinobacteria residing in stony corals.",

The HPLC-UV analysis of the fermentation broth of strain C5-9 indicated the presence of metabolites showing UV absorption around 275 nm. A large-scale shaking culture (2.9 L) was carried out in A16 seawater medium at 30 \u00b0C for five days to obtain adequate amounts of compounds for structure determination and bioassays. The fermentation broth was extracted with 1-butanol, and the extract was fractionated by solvent/solvent partitioning. Following ODS column chromatography and isocratic reversedphase preparative HPLC, 1 (3.7 mg) and 2 (2.4 mg) were isolated ( Figure 1 ). (6E,8Z)-5-Oxo-6,8-tetradecadienoic acid (1) was obtained as a pale yellow amorphous solid. The molecular formula was determined to be C 14 13 C signals were consistent with the number calculated from the molecular formula, which indicated that 1 had a linear structure. The 1 H NMR spectrum showed characteristic resonances for a terminal methyl group at \u03b4 H 0.89 (3H, t) in the shielded region and for multiple methylene signals, suggesting the presence of an alkyl chain. COSY analysis established three spin systems, one from H2 to H4, a sevencarbon fragment from H6 to H12, and an ethyl fragment H13/H14. These partial structures were joined into one linear structure by HMBC correlations from H3, H4, H6, and H7 to C5, H14 to C12, and H11 to C13. Then, a correlation from H2 and H3 to C1 connected the carboxy group at C2 to complete the structure of 1 (Figure 2 ). The geometry of the double bonds was E at C6 and Z at C8 based on the coupling constants J H6,H7 = 15.3 Hz and J H8,H9 = 10.8 Hz, respectively. The molecular formula of 2 was also determined to be C 14 H 22 O 3 on the basis of its NMR and HRESIMS-TOF data 13 C resonances from C6 to C10, which indicated the structural difference between 1 and 2 to be in the double bond geometries. In fact, the composition of 14 carbon signals, the carbon connectivity, and the sites of functional groups in 2 proved to be completely the same as those in 1 by the interpretation of 13 C, DEPT, COSY, and HMBC correlations ( Figure 2 ). While an E configuration at C6 was evident from the coupling constant J H6,H7 = 15.6 Hz, J H8,H9 was unable to be read from the multiplicity pattern of H8 and H9 due to the intense second-order effects caused by a signal overlap of these resonances (\u03b4 H 6.15 and 6.18, respectively). Although the E geometry at C8 was circumstantially obvious and supported by the deshielded allylic carbon atom C10 (\u03b4 C 33.1 for 2 vs 28.3 for 1), a decisive evidence was acquired from spin system simulations using the software 'nmrpeak' [19] , which gave the best match to the experimentally obtained 1 H NMR spectrum with the setting of 3 J H8,H9 = 15.6 Hz and 3 J H7,H8 = 9.5 Hz (Figure 3) . Thus, the C8 geometry was unambiguously determined to be E.",

They are present in all living cells and play crucial roles in biological systems as they are involved in the Krebs cycle and glycolysis [20] . In contrast, keto fatty acids bearing a keto group in the middle of the carbon chain are relatively limited in their distribution in nature. Many of such natural keto fatty acids were found in plants, mainly as a constituent of seed oil [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Among them, rabdosia acids [30] and (10E,12E)-9-oxo-10,12octadecadienoic acid [31] are the plant keto fatty acids containing the dienone moiety with trans,trans-configuration, but congeners with trans,cis-configuration have not been found in nature until the present work ( Figure 4 ). Some of the keto fatty acids of plant origin were shown to exhibit pharmaceutically important activity. (9E,11E)-13-Oxooctadecadienoic acid is a PPAR\u03b1 activator found in tomato juice. This keto fatty acid decreases plasma and hepatic triglyceride in obese diabetic mice by activating PPAR\u03b1 transcription [32] . (10E,12E)-9-Oxooctadecadienoic acid isolated from eggplant calyx induces apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells, leading to cell death [33] . One example of a keto fatty acid from the animal kingdom is (E)-9-oxo-2-decenoic acid, a sex pheromone found in royal jelly. Queen honey bees use this fatty acid to control the activity of worker bees [34] . (E)-7-Oxo-11,13-tetradecadienoic acid is another example of insect origin, identified from hair pencils of male Amauris butterflies (Amauris albimaculata), which is supposed to be a precursor material for the butterfly pheromone [35] . Furthermore, 4-oxo-2-alkenoic fatty acids were characterized as antimicrobial metabolites from an actinomycete [36] and a basidiomycete fungus [37] . In addition, long- chain saturated fatty acids possessing a keto group were detected in the solvent extract of Legionella by GC-MS analysis [38] . Fatty acid components in fresh water-derived Micrococcus species were comprehensively analyzed [39] , but keto fatty acids like compounds 1 and 2, bearing a dienone system, are unprecedented as microbial metabolites.",

The MIC values for 1 against T. maritimum and R. radiobacter were 50 and 6.2 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, while 2 was more potent against T. maritimum, with a MIC of 12.5 \u00b5g/mL, and less against R. radiobacter, with a MIC of 50 \u00b5g/mL, presenting an interesting contrast. No appreciable antimicrobial activity was observed for both compounds against bacterial strains of Micrococcus luteus ATCC9341, Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P JC-1, and Escherichia coli NIHJ JC-2 and yeast strains of Candida albicans NBRC0197 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae S100, nor cytotoxicity against murine leukemia P388 cells at 100 \u00b5M. Additionally, compounds 1 and 2 were evaluated for agonist activity to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) because similar oxo fatty acids are known to act as PPAR agonists [42] . PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors playing key roles in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism [43, 44] . PPAR\u03b1 upregulates lipid uptake and \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, whereas PPAR\u03b3 promotes adipocyte differentiation and adipokine production in adipose tissues to improve insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients [45] [46] [47] . Owing to these physiological functions in energy metabolism, PPARs are the molecular targets of metabolic disorders [48] . To assess the PPAR isoform specificity of 1 and 2, three reporter cell lines expressing luciferase genes in response to PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, and PPAR\u03b3 agonists were used [49] . The agonist activity was determined as a relative potency to the positive controls, WY14643 for PPAR\u03b1, GW0742 for PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, and troglitazone for PPAR\u03b3. Both 1 and 2 induced activations of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 transcription but were not effective against PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 ( Figure 5 ). Compared to the activity at 12.5 \u03bcM, slight increases of PPAR\u03b1 and \u03b2/\u03b4 agonist activities were observed for 1 at the lower concentration of 6.25 \u03bcM, but the activity at 6.25 \u03bcM was almost equivalent to the activity level of the vehicle DMSO. We thus considered that 1 had no significant activity at 6.25 \u03bcM. Overall, 1 was lesser potent than 2, indicating that the geometry at C8 may play a crucial role in the binding to PPARs.",

The coral piece was homogenized by mortar and pestle with an equal volume of sterile natural seawater (1 mL), and the resulting suspension was serially diluted tenfold to 10 \u22125 . One-hundred \u03bcL aliquots of each dilution were spread onto Marine Agar 2216 (Difco), and the agar plates were cultivated at 23 \u00b0C for two days. Single colonies thus emerged on the plates, which were transferred onto a new agar medium to obtain pure isolates. One of these isolates, coded as C5-9, was identified as a member of the genus Micrococcus on the basis of 99.9% similarity in the 16S rRNA gene sequence (1395 nucleotides; DNA Data Bank of Japan/DDBJ accession number LC498624) to Micrococcus yunnanensis YIM 65004 T (accession number FJ214355).",

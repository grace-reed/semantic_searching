Using mouse lines expressing the photoconvertible protein Kaede, we have shown previously that Tregs migrating to the draining lymph node (dLN) from inflamed skin in an antigen-specific manner (\"migratory Tregs\") more frequently express migratory molecules such as CD103 and display superior suppression of the CHS response compared with Tregs pre-existing within the dLN (\"LN-resident Tregs\") 1 . In this study, a subset of Tregs that expressed exceptionally high levels of CD25 (CD25 ++ Tregs) became apparent under the CHS condition. CD25 ++ Tregs were more frequent among migratory Tregs than among LN-resident Tregs. Because of their transient emergence after CHS induction and higher CD25 expression than naturally-occurring Tregs (nTregs) , CD25 ++ Tregs might correspond to so-called induced Tregs (iTregs). CD25 ++ migratory Tregs possess stronger suppressive capacity than CD25 int/\u2212 migratory Tregs. Thus, CD25 ++ migratory Tregs are likely to play an important role in the immune regulation of acute skin inflammation.",

Il10-expressing Tregs frequently co-expressed the Treg effector genes, Gzmb, Ctla4, and Tgfb1 in a hierarchical manner. Furthermore, Gzmb-/Il10-expressing Treg subsets expressed the novel markers CD43 and CCR5. CD43 + CCR5 + CXCR3 \u2212 Tregs highly expressed skin-tropic chemokine receptors CCR4 and CCR8. We also measured the retention of Treg subsets within inflamed skin using mice expressing the photoconvertible protein KikGR, and found that the subset of Tregs that was most highly retained in the skin, CD43 + CCR5 + CXCR3 \u2212 Tregs, had superior in vivo inhibitory function to other Treg subsets.",

These mice also enable detection of Foxp3 + Tregs by surface staining with an anti-human CD2 (hCD2) antibody 12 . CHS was induced by painting 2,4-dinitro-1-fluoro-benzene (DNFB) onto the abdominal skin of KikGR/Foxp3 hCD2/hCD52 mice 5 days after immunization via the dorsal skin ( Supplementary  Fig. 1A ). Photoconversion of the inflamed skin was used to label migratory cells originating from the site of CHS. CD4 + hCD2 + Tregs in the dLN (axillary LN) of CHS mice were sorted into four subpopulations: (1) CD25 ++ KikGR-Red + skin-derived migratory Tregs; (2) CD25 int/\u2212 KikGR-Red + skin-derived migratory Tregs; (3) CD25 ++ KikGR-Green + LN-resident Tregs; and, (4) CD25 int/\u2212 KikGR-Green + LN-resident Tregs (Fig. 1A) .

We thus compared gene expression levels between individual Tregs with and without expression of the genes Gzmb and Il10 (Fig. 3A ) in order to determine surface markers other than CD25 that identify Gzmb-/Il10-expressing Tregs. A number of surface molecules including Spn, Ccr5, and Il2ra were commonly and highly expressed in both Gzmb-and Il10-expressing cells, and Gzmb-expressing cells highly expressed the Th1-related genes Cxcr3, Il12rb2, and Tbx21 (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, a subcluster of Th1-related genes including Ccr5 and Tbx21 positively correlated with Gzmb and Il10 in a correlation network derived from CD25 int/\u2212 scqPCR data (Fig. 3B ). This result suggested that it may be possible to use the expression of these genes to distinguish Gzmb/Il10-expressing Tregs from other Tregs.",

For example, GzmB expression in CD4 + T cells is induced by antigen stimulation together with exposure to a Th1-polarized environment 29, 30 , and Il10 gene expression is downregulated in T-bet-deficient Tregs during Th1-type inflammation 31 . Our scqPCR data also revealed Th1 polarization in highly activated Tregs with Il10 and Gzmb expression. Furthermore, Th1 differentiation is induced by TCR signaling of proper intensity without relation to the extrinsic environment 32 . The rapid cell cycling that we observed in CD43 + CCR5 + and CD43 + CXCR3 + Tregs in the dLN (Fig. 6D ) and the differential TCR V\u03b2 repertoire between CD43 + CCR5 + CXCR3 \u2212 Tregs and CD43 \u2212 Tregs (data not shown) suggested that the Tregs in our experiments received proper TCR stimulation.

W. Shand 7 , Yasutaka Nakanishi 1 , Takeshi Watanabe 8 & Michio Tomura 1,+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) migrating from the skin to the draining lymph node (dLN) have a strong immunosuppressive effect on the cutaneous immune response. However, the subpopulations responsible for their inhibitory function remain unclear. We investigated single-cell gene expression heterogeneity in Tregs from the dLN of inflamed skin in a contact hypersensitivity model. The immunosuppressive genes Ctla4 and Tgfb1 were expressed in the majority of Tregs. Although Il10expressing Tregs were rare, unexpectedly, the majority of Il10-expressing Tregs co-expressed Gzmb and displayed Th1-skewing. Single-cell profiling revealed that CD43 + CCR5 + Tregs represented the main subset within the Il10/Gzmb-expressing cell population in the dLN. Moreover, CD43 + CCR5 + CXCR3 \u2212 Tregs expressed skin-tropic chemokine receptors, were preferentially retained in inflamed skin and downregulated the cutaneous immune response. The identification of a rare Treg subset co-expressing multiple immunosuppressive molecules and having tissue-remaining capacity offers a novel strategy for the control of skin inflammatory responses."

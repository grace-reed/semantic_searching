It contains conserved sequences including AA in the apical loop and AUGA at the base of one of the stems (8, 9, 11) . By recruiting SBP2, AUGA is involved in the formation of the translational complex for Sec insertion at the UGA codon. This SECIS motif, together with an in-frame UGA, are key features in the design of an algorithm for identification of selenoprotein genes (8, 12, 13) . By using this strategy, mammals were found to contain 24 -25 selenoprotein genes (14) .",

Interestingly, almost all functionally characterized selenoproteins contain a single Sec and a single SECIS element. Prominent exceptions include SelP (a selenium transport protein in plasma of animals) and SelL that occurs in aquatic organisms (24) . It was also reported that the single Sec in selenoproteins has a catalytic function and corresponds to the position of catalytic Cys in thiol oxidoreductases (5, (25) (26) (27) . The two Sec in SelL were also suggested to participate in redox catalysis through a diselenide bond (24) , and even several Sec residues in SelP correspond to Cys in other homologs, including one Sec that corresponds to Cys in the catalytic sites of thiol oxidoreductases. The role of Sec as a catalytic residue is supported by numerous experimental data wherein a change of Sec to Cys reduced enzyme activity 100 -1000-fold in glycine reductase (28) , methionine sulfoxide reductase B1 (MsrB1) (29) , glutathione peroxidase (30, 31) , type I deiodinase (32) , and several other selenoproteins. Therefore, it is now widely accepted that new Sec residues primarily evolve to substitute Cys residues to carry out redox catalysis. However, recently evolved Sec residues have not been described. The availability of sequence information for hundreds of genomes provides an opportunity to identify transient Sec residues.",

This is only the second selenoprotein identified (besides SelP) to have more than one Sec and more than one SECIS element. In addition, two Sec residues that form a catalytic diselenide bond were reported for SelL, a selenoprotein present in aquatic organisms (24) . Also, certain selenoprotein genes were found to have two SECIS elements, e.g. SelW1 in Ciona intestinalis (35, 36) , but only its second SECIS element was compatible with the strict pattern when analyzed by SECISearch (35) . Thus, four in-frame TGA codons and two SECIS elements in M. senile MsrB represent a unique case, and studying the role of multiple Sec and SECIS elements in this protein may provide insights into selenoprotein evolution. Evolution of M. senile MsrB-Sec often evolves to replace catalytic Cys, and thus, Cys homologs of nearly all selenoproteins are known. M. senile MsrB possesses one TGA codon that codes for the conserved catalytic Sec (Fig. 1 , A and B, Sec residue 4) but also three non-conserved TGA codons (Fig. 1 , A and B, Sec residues 1-3). Analysis of MsrB sequences revealed that the first three TGA codons can be obtained by single nucleotide replacements (or two nucleotides in one case) from other MsrBs (Fig. 1A) . Moreover, these TGA codons are only found in M. senile MsrB, i.e. they are absent in all other MsrB sequences available in NCBI databases (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2 ). These observations suggest that M. senile MsrB only recently evolved these three in-frame TGA codons.",

On the other hand, in Sepp1, two SECIS elements are of different types, e.g. they show no homology. To investigate the functions of duplicated SECIS elements, we mutated conserved nucleotides in the SECIS core to disrupt one or both SECIS elements and examined Sec insertion by these structures by metabolic 75 Se labeling (Fig. 4) . Single SECIS mutants still supported Sec insertion regardless of the position of the TGA codon, whereas mutation of both SECIS elements completely disrupted Sec insertion. Thus, both SECIS elements in M. senile MsrB were functional and supported Sec insertion at all TGA positions. Interestingly, the data suggested that the two SECIS elements collaborated for Sec insertion. For example, expression of MsrB from the construct with either SECIS element mutated was less efficient than MsrB expression when both SECIS elements were intact (Fig. 4B) . Therefore, we conclude that SECIS duplication led to an increase in Sec insertion efficiency in M. senile MsrB. This appears to be the first finding of SECIS elements collaborating in Sec insertion (SECIS elements in SelP show position-specific Sec insertion).",

This case highlights the importance of multiple criteria used in selenoprotein identification (37).

Cell lysates of HEK 293 cells expressing MsrB with four Sec residues (UUUU) or a single Sec wherein other Sec positions were occupied by Cys or Ser (UCCC, CUCC, CCUC, CCCU, or SSSU) showed no MsrB activity (Fig.  5A ). To further characterize MsrB activity of the M. senile protein, we prepared recombinant MsrB forms in which all Sec residues were replaced with Cys. It is known that Cys mutants of selenoproteins show a significant decrease in catalytic activity, but the activity is still detectable. We used mouse MsrB1-Cys (in which Sec was replaced with Cys) as a positive control. Again, no activity was detected in M. senile MsrB preparations, whereas MsrB1-Cys showed activity (\u03f34200 pmol/min/mg). We also carried out in vivo complementation assays of yeast cells lacking all three Msrs and supplemented with Met-R-SO in place of Met. The yeast strain lacking MsrA, MsrB, and fRMsr was transformed with the construct coding for Cys-containing M. senile MsrB (CCCC) or its other mutant forms (CCSS, SSSS, SSSC, or CCCS) and then tested for growth on Met-R-SO-supplemented, Met-deficient medium.

                "text": "Iron-Sulfur Cluster in M. senile MsrB-The finding that M. senile MsrB was not active in reducing Met-R-SO offered a challenge to identify the role of the four Sec residues. A clue was provided by an MsrB form containing four Cys residues in place of four Sec. This recombinant protein had brownish color ( Fig.  6A ) and showed absorbance peaks at 338 and 412 nm (Fig. 6B) . These properties were compatible with the occurrence of a cofactor, most likely an iron-sulfur cluster. To test for the presence of iron in this protein, recombinant M. senile MsrB (the CCCC form), its mutants (SSSC, SSSS, CCSS, and CCCS), and mouse MsrB1-Cys were subjected to metal analysis using ICP-MS. Indeed, 0.3 equivalents of iron were found in M. senile MsrB (CCCC), whereas iron was not detected or was present at very low levels in other mutant forms (SSSC, SSSS, CCSS, and CCCS) and in MsrB1-Cys (Fig. 6C) . In addition, M. senile MsrB and its mutants (as well as MsrB1-Cys) had approximately one equivalent of zinc (Fig. 6D ), indicating preservation of this structural metal ion. We also observed substoichiometric levels of arsenic and copper (Fig. 6, E and F) , which were dependent on the same four Cys. Overall, the biochemical data suggested the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster that was coordinated by four Cys residues in the M. senile mutant MsrB.",

The presence of selenium in place of sulfur would make these residues even more reactive because Sec has a higher polarizability and lower pK a (\u03f35.2) than Cys (\u03f38.3) and therefore could readily react with incoming substrate or other proximal residues. On the other hand, Cys often requires assistance from its microenvironment for deprotonation and nucleophilic attack.

Moreover, activity assays and growth complementation data revealed no activity of M. senile MsrB in reducing free Met-R-SO. These data show that some, if not all, Sec residues in this protein function as non-catalytic residues. Consistent with this idea, we found that Cys residues in the recombinant MsrB (which replaced Sec in the wild-type protein) bound 0.3 equivalents of iron, suggesting a possibility that they coordinated an iron-sulfur cluster. Selenium is positioned below sulfur in the periodic table of elements, and so its chemical properties are similar to those of sulfur (38) . Therefore, the use of Sec to bind a metal is not unexpected from a physicochemical point of view. In support of this possibility, Sec-metal complexes were reported in several proteins, e.g. E. coli (39) and Desulfovibrio gigas (40) formate dehydrogenases. Moreover, genetically engineered azurin was shown to possess an Se-Cu bond (41) . Molybdenum, tungsten, copper, and nickel are known to be coordinated by Sec residues, and it is also feasible that other transition metals (including iron) could be coordinated by Sec.",

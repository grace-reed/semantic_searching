    "abstract": "Bleaching refers to the loss of colour in symbioses between dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium and marine benthic animals, e.g. corals. Bleaching generally results in depressed growth and increased mortality, and it can be considered as a deleterious physiological response or ailment. An explanatory framework for the causes of bleaching comprises three elements: the external factors or triggers of bleaching, e.g. elevated temperature; the symptoms, including elimination of algal cells and loss of algal pigment; and the mechanisms, which define the response of the symbiosis to the triggers, resulting in the observed symptoms. The extent to which bleaching in different symbioses and in response to different triggers involves common mechanisms is currently unknown, but a contribution of interactions between the algal and animal partners to bleaching is predicted. Symbioses vary in their susceptibility to bleaching as a result of genetic variation in Symbiodinium and acclimatory responses of the animal. The evolutionary explanation for bleaching is obscure. Perhaps, bleaching was of selective advantage to the animal hosts under different (more benign?) environmental conditions than the present, or bleaching may be a negative by-product of an otherwise advantageous symbiotic trait, such as the elimination of damaged algal cells.",

It has been discussed in the soap opera Neighbors (or so I am told) and, more seriously, it is recognised widely as a factor damaging the already fragile economies of various developing countries and livelihood of their peoples. Marine biologists have played a crucial role in achieving this awareness, by well-organised and publicised monitoring of bleaching events. Bleaching events are increasing in frequency and severity (Wilkinson, 1999) , and the ecological collapse of the world\u00d5s reefs is predicted by simulation models using current data on the incidence of bleaching and projected climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Risk, 1999) .",

The recent, large-scale bleaching events on the world\u00d5s reefs have been attributed principally to elevated sea water temperature, often combined with increased solar radiation, and they have been linked to long-term changes in global climate, compounded by El Ni\u00f1 no events (e.g. Stone et al., 1999; Walther et al., 2002) . Chronic pollution and pathogenic micro-organisms may act synergistically with these abiotic factors. For example, the virulence of the bacterium Vibrio shiloi, the causative agent of bleaching in the coral Oculina patagonica, is strongly temperature dependent, requiring temperatures P 25\u00b0C (Banin et al., 2001a) .",

A key issue to our understanding of bleaching is the extent to which the external factors triggering bleaching determine the symptoms of bleaching. How uniform are the bleaching symptoms displayed by different animal/Symbiodinium taxa in response to one factor, and do the symptoms exhibited by a single symbiosis vary between the different triggering factors? These twin questions can be answered empirically, and they should contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of bleaching, the central and crucial element to the explanatory framework in Fig. 1 .",

Future research should not only identify and characterise these and other components of the mechanisms of bleaching but also elucidate their interactions, to yield the network of molecular and biochemical events that define the bleaching mechanisms. In this context, there is a valid place for model symbioses maintained under defined conditions and exposed to triggers of bleaching that may not relate precisely to the triggers of greatest importance in the field. It is self-evident that the bleaching mechanisms cannot be identical in response to different triggers. For example, prolonged darkness causes bleaching without direct damage to photosystem II of the Symbiodinium cells. What is not clear is whether bleaching in response to different triggers and occurring in different symbioses involve common mechanistic components. If there are no universal elements to the mechanisms of bleaching, then bleaching becomes an \u00d4umbrella\u00d5 term for several or multiple disparate syndromes; to pursue the jigsaw metaphor used above, studying the mechanisms of bleaching would be like trying to solve more than one puzzle simultaneously.",

In the non-bleaching symbiosis, the apparently harmonious persistence, growth and division of the animal and algal cells are underlain by the exchange of nutrients between the partners, including the translocation of substantial amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon from the algal cells to the animal (Trench, 1993) and a predicted (but unexplored) parallel exchange of signalling molecules. In the bleaching symbiosis, the algal cells are metabolically compromised, with a diminished capacity to provide the animal with photo-synthetic carbon (Perez et al., 2001 ). This raises the possibility that the symbiosis is maintained by the sustained production by the algal cells of a signal that inactivates the animal defence responses to foreign organisms, and the loss of this signal leads to bleaching ( Fig. 2a) . A candidate for this putative signal is the receipt of algal-derived photosynthate by the animal; in the analogous symbiosis between Chlorella and hydra (a freshwater Cnidarian), Chlorella cells with low rates of photosynthate release are expelled from the symbiosis at elevated rates (Douglas and Smith, 1984) . Alternatively or additionally, Symbiodinium cells metabolically unbalanced by a trigger of bleaching may release specific compounds or display relatively uncontrolled leakage of cytoplasmic contents, to which the animal partners responds defensively (Fig. 2b ). These scenarios raise two possibilities: that the mechanisms and symptoms of bleaching include parallels with the response of Cnidaria to potential pathogens; and that specific algal signals to the animal (or the collapse of these signals) are the common elements in the mechanisms of bleaching in response to all triggers.",

Among coral colonies containing both of ribotype B and ribotype C, those with algal populations dominated by B (>80% of the algal cells) did not display bleaching detectable by eye in response to the elevated temperature/irradiance conditions in late summer 1995, and those with algal populations comprising 35% or more of ribotype C became pale or bleached (Fig. 3a) . Furthermore, algal cells of ribotype C declined in number disproportionately during bleaching, in colonies containing mixtures of ribotype C and A and/or B (Fig. 3b) . The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that cells of ribotype C in Montastraea species have a lower tolerance than ribotypes A and B to elevated temperature/irradiance, and that this difference can account for the observed intraspecific variation in bleaching susceptibility.

The sea water levels in the region are low in the first months of the year, such that corals at the study site are fully emmersed at low tide (which happens to occur in the afternoon) for some days. If cloud cover is low, as is common place at this time of year, the west face of the exposed corals experiences high light levels, causing localised solar bleaching from which the corals recover promptly. In several years in the last decade, the sea water temperature in the region has exceeded the norm in April/May. This has caused thermal bleaching of the corals, apart from the west face recently recovered from solar bleaching (Brown et al., 2000) .",

Furthermore, the algal cells from the east and west faces of the corals did not differ significantly in levels of stress proteins, antioxidant enzymes or photoprotective xanthophylls, all of which would be predicted to contribute to protection against temperature/light-induced cellular damage. The animal tissues from the east and west faces of the corals, however, were biochemically distinctive: with significantly elevated levels the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase and the stress proteins hsp60 and hsp70 on the west face, relative to the east face (Brown et al., 2002b) .

                "text": "Two predictions arise directly from recent research on the variation in susceptibility to bleaching. First, Symbiodinium ribotypes A and D are anticipated to be favoured over ribotype C and possibly B in some animal species subjected to bleaching episodes. This may result in a shift in the dominant Symbiodinium ribotype to A/D in some species, and increased abundance of species capable of forming a symbiosis with these ribotypes. The impact on the species composition of host communities depends critically on the specificity of the symbioses, i.e. the taxonomic range of Symbiodinium with which they can associate. Various surveys using small samples sizes at one or a few sites have suggested that many host species are specific to single ribotypes or even subgroups of one ribotype [reviewed in Rowan (1998) ], but more extended sampling protocols have identified two or multiple Symbiodinium ribotypes in various host species. Commonly, most host individuals bear one detectable ribotype, and a different ribotype is dominant in a low proportion of animals tested or at particular sites (e.g. Van Oppen et al., 2001; Toller et al., 2001b; Savage et al., 2002) . The contribution of genetic, developmental and environmental factors to this variation is not known, but the data available suggest that many symbioses may be described more aptly as \u00d4selec-tive\u00d5 than as \u00d4specific\u00d5 in their choice of algal partner. A complicating factor in these considerations is that the abundance of a symbiosis bearing a particular Symbiodinium ribotype is also predicted to be influenced by the impact of the acquired Symbiodinium cells on the performance of the host, including the long-term effects on growth, reproduction and resistance to disease. The physiological functions of Symbiodinium cells in symbioses recovered from bleaching and its impact on animal performance have not been investigated.",

Ribotype A can be described as more invasive than ribotype C, but invasiveness is not equivalent to superiority, which relates to the capacity to promote performance of the host. A useful parallel is provided by the nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria in the root nodules of wild leguminous plants. Very commonly, the populations of rhizobia in these plants fix nitrogen at low rates and promote relatively poor plant growth, but they are very competitive and infect the plant roots more efficiently than symbiotically superior strains (Thies et al., 1991; Denton et al., 2002) . As considered in Section 4.3, the impacts of Symbiodinium ribotypes on host performance have yet to be investigated.

                "text": "Data from other symbioses provide support for this scenario. Specifically, hydra (a freshwater cnidarian) can be infected with strains of the green alga Chlorella that release much of their photosynthetically fixed carbon and support high growth rates of the hydra (superior strains) and strains that release little photosynthate and support low hydra growth rates (inferior strains). When symbioses between hydra and the inferior strains are incubated with a superior strain of Chlorella, the inferior strains are not replaced, even though the superior strains form an association readily with alga-free hydra (McAuley and Smith, 1982) . The underlying mechanisms are obscure, but one possibility is that animal cells competent to house the symbiotic algal cells (a subpopulation of cells in the endodermal layer of Cnidaria) can acquire exogenous algal cells only if they lack a resident algal population, i.e. if they are \u00d4empty host cells\u00d5 and are not already infected with algal cells. These considerations suggest that this process of the adaptive bleaching hypothesis is plausible. (c) An alternative (putatively superior) strain of Symbiodinium is available to populate the bleached animal host. In principle, the replacing Symbiodinium cells may be members of the residual population of algal cells in the bleached host or of external origin, i.e. in the water column. Residual populations are regularly observed in a bleached symbiosis, and they could repopulate the host relatively rapidly by proliferation within the few infected host cells, exocytosis from individual cells and subsequent uptake by \u00d4empty host cells\u00d5 within the same host (Jones and Yellowlees, 1997) . The residual populations may include cells genetically different from the dominant Symbiodinium cells in the pre-bleaching association because some symbioses bear two-to-multiple Symbiodinium taxa, all but one at very low densities undetectable by the methods used routinely to type Symbiodinium populations (Santos et al., 2001 ). Symbiodinium cells have been detected in the freeliving condition (Carlos et al., 1999) . They are apparently not a common or abundant member of phytoplankton populations, but their incidence during bleaching events is unknown. To summarise, plausible processes can be invoked to meet this prediction of the adaptive bleaching hypothesis, but the incidence (and relative importance) of alternative Symbiodinium cells in residual populations or external environment of bleaching symbioses remain to be quantified.",

Colonies of several scleractinian coral species were reciprocally transplanted between deep (20-23 m) and shallow (2-3 m) locations on the Caribbean coast of Panama. The colonies transferred from shallow to deep suffered higher mortality than those transplanted in the opposite direction and only the latter displayed bleaching with replacement of Symbiodinium ribotype C. The correlation between coral survival and Symbiodinium replacement is consistent with the adaptive bleaching hypothesis, but the causal basis of the link is uncertain, i.e. there is no evidence that the superior survivorship of the deepto-shallow transplants was a consequence of their bleaching.",

It is probably unhelpful to describe bleaching as a single ailment, or to expect the explanation of the causes of bleaching to be simple. As Section 3 and Fig. 1 illustrate, bleaching can be considered to comprise three elements (trigger, mechanism, symptoms), and some or all of the components of each element may not be uniform across different symbioses environmental circumstances.",

The quantitative impact on these factors in the projected incidence of bleaching can be explored by extension of current simulation modelling. Contrary to some claims (e.g. Risk, 1999) , it is premature to ''write-off'' the Symbiodinium symbioses and the world\u00d5s coral reef ecosystems as unable to tolerate the climate change. The need for sustained management of the reef ecosystems and protection from local anthropogenic factors is greater than ever.",

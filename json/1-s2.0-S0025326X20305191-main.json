Biochemical biomarkers were analyzed in tissues (gills, digestive gland, and mantle) of clams exposed to the environmental concentration of 1 \u03bcg/L BP3, at seawater natural pH (pH 8.1) and at lower pH (pH 7.6). The tissues responded in different ways considering their physiological roles. In general, BP3 altered activity of the enzymes, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione cysteine ligase (GCL); but mostly increased the level of glutathione (GSH). These effects were enhanced by acidification, without augmenting lipid peroxidation (LPO). Carbonic anhydrase activity (CA) increased after BP3 exposure in the digestive gland and decreased in the gills at pH 7.6, while Ca 2+-ATPase activity was affected by acidification only. Changing levels of these enzymes can alter shell formation and affect the bivalve maintenance in impacted environments.",

                "text": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation filters are compounds present in sunscreens and other personal care products to protect the skin from solar radiation. Among these compounds, Benzophenone-3 (BP3), also known as oxybenzone (2-hydroxyl-4-methoxybenzophenone) is commonly used. BP3 reaches aquatic environments through direct inputs as removal from skin in recreation activities, and indirect inputs that include releases from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), unable to remove BP3 from domestic effluents which, in turn, achieve the oceans as final destination. This compound has been widely detected in bodies of water, biota, and sediment (Tashiro and Kameda, 2013; Tsui et al., 2014; Gago-Ferrero et al., 2015; Sharifan et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2017) . In seawater, the environmental concentration of BP3 ranges from 0.1 \u03bcg/L to 5.4 \u03bcg/L Tsui et al., 2014; Ramos et al., 2015) . BP3 is a chemical of environmental concern due to the low degradability in aquatic environments and because it has capacity for being accumulated by organisms, mainly in lipophilic tissues (Log Kow 3.79) (Rodil et al., 2009; Gago-Ferrero et al., 2012; Vione et al., 2013; . Sang and Leung (2016) calculated the risk quotient (RQ) for BP3 as 2.60 and indicated that this UV filter may pose significant risks to the marine aquatic ecosystems.",

In addition, BP3 is harmful to corals, causing malformations in larvae and increasing bleaching rates (Downs et al., 2016; He et al., 2019) . As a result, there are locations (e.g. Pacific archipelago of Palau and Hawaii, USA) that have banned the commercialization and use of sunscreens containing BP3 (Republic of Palau, 2018; Hawaii State Legislature, 2018) . Despite the growing studies evaluating the detrimental effects of BP3 on aquatic biota, its use is allowed in vast majority of countries.",

The higher the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 , the greater the concentration of CO in the ocean due to the diffusional balance between the atmosphere and the oceanic compartments (Feely et al., 2009) . One third of all CO 2 released into the atmosphere is incorporated into the oceans and this is favored by its high solubility in water (Sabine et al., 2004) . With the beginning of the industrial revolution, the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 increased from approximately 280 to 390 ppm (Feely et al., 2009) . Currently, researches conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), indicates that atmospheric CO 2 concentrations will be between 750 and ppm by the end of this century (IPCC, 2014) . Based on this, it is estimated that the pH of the oceans may decrease from 8.1 to 7.6 in the same period (Feely et al., 2009; Doney et al., 2009) .",

                "text": "In recent decades, the process of ocean acidification has drawn attention because of the damage that it causes to marine organisms. In the oceans, an increased CO 2 level causes an increase in H + ions and a reduction in carbonate concentrations (CO 3 2\u2212 ), which is used to buffer H + to prevent decreases in pH. The decrease in CO 3 2\u2212 concentration reduces the calcium carbonate (CaCO ) saturation state, directly affecting organisms that depend on this compound to produce their shells or skeletons (Orr, 2011; Andersson and Gledhill, 2013) . When the CO 2 concentration exceeds the buffering capacity of water, the pH inevitably decreases. Some effects of ocean acidification have been studied experimentally in calcifying organisms. For example, in bivalve mollusks, including Mercenaria mercenaria, Crassostrea virginica, and Argopecten irradians, survival, development, growth, and lipid synthesis during the larval stage were reduced with the increase in water temperature and CO 2 concentration (Talmage and Gobler, 2011) . Alterations in the growth of calcifying organisms may be associated with activities of the Ca 2+ -ATPase and carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymes. The Ca 2+ -ATPase captures and transports calcium ions to calcification sites (Zebral et al., 2019) , while CA catalyzes the hydration of CO 2 , resulting in the formation of H + and HCO 3 \u2212 . The complexation of HCO 3 \u2212 with calcium forms CaCO 3 which is deposited in the shell for growth (Jorge et al., 2016; Zebral et al., 2019) . Conversely, acidification can alter the redox state of an organism, and in this respect, antioxidant enzymes may indicate the stress. Matozzo et al. (2013) observed an increase in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the bivalves Chamelea gallina and Mytilus gallaprovincialis exposed to low pHs (7.7 and 7.4). Authors related the increase in antioxidants defenses to a decrease in lipid peroxidation (LPO), a well-established signal of oxidative stress. Ecotoxicological researches conducted with bivalve mollusks have shown their ability to accumulate organic contaminants, including UV filters (Sang and Leung, 2016; Peng et al., 2017) . Bivalves are considered as excellent sentinel species for environmental contamination because they are sessile, filter feeders and relatively tolerant to several compounds. Additionally, they have great ecological and economic importance. The yellow clam, Amarilladesma mactroides, is a marine bivalve suspension-feeder, inhabiting sandy beaches over the southern coast of Brazil and coasts of Uruguay and Argentina (Herrmann et al., 2011) . There are several studies that show the relevance of A. mactroides as a model for toxicological evaluations, including those that use biomarkers as tools to assess toxicity of chemicals (Giacomin et al., 2014; Nogueira et al., 2013; Jorge et al., 2016) .",

In this sense, GST participates in antioxidant defense, neutralizing products of LPO and conjugating xenobiotics with reduced glutathione (GSH). Conjugation with GSH makes the xenobiotic less reactive and more soluble for excretion. GSH is also part of non-enzymatic antioxidant defense as it can interact directly with oxidative molecules. Glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) catalyzes the binding of amino acids, glutamate and cysteine, for the further formation of GSH; while LPO is a measurement of oxidative cellular damage (Hermes-Lima, 2004) . Biomarkers other than those involved in antioxidant defense or biotransformation can be also affected by the presence of pollutant and adverse conditions such as acidification. In this context, activities of the CA and Ca 2+ -ATPase enzymes are considered as feasible biomarkers for calcifying organisms in face of acidification.",

The desired salinity was checked using a refractometer (Atago, Brazil). BP3 (99% purity) used for water contamination was commercially obtained from a compounding pharmacy (BOTICA -Farm\u00e1cia de manipula\u00e7\u00e3o, CNPJ-04.508.808/0001-35). BP3 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (100%) at 10 mg/L and this solution, named as working solution, was then added to the aquariums immediately before clam addition at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/L of BP3 and 0.01% DMSO. Due to the low solubility of BP3 in water, we used DMSO as a vehicle to dissolve this compound. DMSO is one of the most widely used vehicle in in vivo and in vitro experiments due to its \"low\" toxicity when compared to other solvents such as acetone. The concentration of 0.01% of solvent is the maximum concentration recommended in guidelines for testing toxicity of chemicals (OECD 121, 2010). In addition, many studies that evaluated the effects of BP3 on aquatic organisms used DMSO as solvent (Gao et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Downs et al., 2016) .

A sample volume of 250 mL of saltwater from each aquarium was taken and filtered using 0.47 \u03bcm fiberglass membrane filters. The BP3 compound was extracted from saltwater by solid phase extraction (SPE). C18 cartridges (500 mg, 6 mL) (Supelco, Sigma Aldrich\u00ae, Brazil) were previously activated with 5 mL methanol (HPLC grade), 5 mL acetonitrile (HPLC grade), and 5 mL of ultrapure water. In solid phase extraction (SPE), the sample was preconcentrated in 125 times (250 mL to 2 mL). After BP3 extraction, 10 mL of ultrapure water was percolated in the cartridges to remove excess salt and were then dried with a vacuum pump and stored at 4\u00b0C for further analysis. To quantify BP3, the cartridges were eluted with 1 mL of methanol and 1 mL of acetonitrile. The extracts were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The HPLC system was composed of a Waters 600 pump model, associated with a Waters 2996 Photodiode Array Detector, a Rheodyne 20 \u03bcL loop injector, and connected to an Empower PDA software for data acquisition. The analytical column used was a Synergi Fusion 4 \u03bcm (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm). The mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and ultrapure water at pH 3, (70:30, v/v). The instrumental limit of detection (LOD) was 15 \u00b5g/L and the instrumental limit of quantification (LOQ) was 50 \u00b5g/L. BP3 (purity grade > 99%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich\u00ae, Brazil.",

Concentrations of BP3 up to 12.4 ng/g dry weight (dw) were reported in mussels inhabiting Hong Kong coastal waters by Sang and Leung (2016) . The authors also detected one of the main metabolites of BP3, the Benzophenone-8 (BP8) compound, which seems to be more easily bioaccumulative than BP3, possible, due to its higher Log Kow (4.31 for BP8 and 3.79 for BP3). Meanwhile, in Spain waters Rodil et al. (2019) reported 63 ng/g dw BP3 as the maximum concentration observed in marine bilvalves from the Galician coast, while in Almu\u00f1ecar, Mart\u00edn et al. (2017) described a concentration of 53.9 ng/g dw BP3 in the sea cucumber Holothuria tubulosa; however, later Mart\u00edn et al., (2020) indicated that BP3 is \"non accumulative\" to H. tubulosa due to its low value bioconcentration factor, this factor calculated by them. Regarding the time necessary for the uptake and bioaccumulation of BP3 Vidal-Li\u00f1\u00e1n et al.

Also, it was evidenced in different groups of organisms, that BP3 have the capacity of activating their antioxidant defense system, these including enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), GST, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (Gao et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Rodr\u00edguez-Fuentes et al., 2015; Mu\u00f1iz-Gonz\u00e1lez and Mart\u00ednez-Guitarte, 2020) . The lower activity of GCL observed in gills of clams exposed to BP3 at pH 7.6, associated with the GSH increase (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively) , suggests that BP3 induced the GCL activity for an increase in the GSH synthesis within the 96 h of the experiment, as was observed in the GSH total concentration. However, as the time passed towards the end of the 96 h, probably the BP3 reduced the activity of this enzyme, leading to a later decrease in GSH levels. In a similar way, Huang et al. (2018) observed an increase in GSH levels in the gills of Mytilus coruscus exposed to nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2 at 10 mg/L) for 24 h at pH 8.1 and 7.3; and after 3 days, GSH levels started to decrease at the pH 7.3. Another point to consider is that GSH is a competitive inhibitor of GCL and when the levels of GSH are very high, GCL can be inhibited as a negative feedback mechanism (Hermes-Lima, 2004) . Regardless of the pathways that led to a decrease in GCL activity, this situation only occurred under acidification, indicating that animals at pH 7.6 could be more susceptible to the effects of BP3. However, we must remember that there was an increase in the activity of GST in the gills of clams under conditions of acidification, thus stimulating a response for general protection. In all treatments, LPO levels were not increased in the gills (Fig. 1 and  Fig. 4, respectively) , indicating that gills may cope with acute exposure to BP3, even at pH 7.6.",

(2015) also detected an increase in the GST activity in liver of goldfish Carassius auratus exposed to 0.5 and 5 mg/L of BP3, however, in contrast to our results it was reported an increase in GSH concentration as well. The authors suggested that GST is involved in the biotransformation of BP3 and, thus, in the formation of GSH-BP3 complexes for BP3 elimination. Although, it is important to consider that concentrations of BP3 used by Liu et al. (2015) were higher than those used in this study. Moreover, the lack of reaction by GST in the digestive gland of organisms exposed to BP3 at pH 7.6, compared to an increase in activity at pH 8.1, reinforces a possible failure in detoxification responses in the face of acidification.",

Probably because the mantle has a high activity of ATPases (e.g. Na + /K + -ATPase, Ca 2+ -ATPase and H + -ATPase), and CA due to its role in shell mineralization and acid-base balance (Marin et al., 2012; Liao et al., 2019) .",

                "text": "Ca 2+ -ATPase was affected only by exposure to pH 7.6 in gills and digestive gland of clams. Despite the mantle role in the shell mineralization of mollusks (Fan et al., 2007; Marin et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2019) , we did not observe any effects of pH or BP3 on Ca 2+ -ATPase activity in this tissue (Fig. 5 ). This enzyme is directly involved in calcium uptake needed for shell formation; however, shell mineralization does not depend only on calcium but also on the availability of carbonated species to form aragonite or calcite, which, in turn, is directly related to environmental pH (lower pH, lower concentration of carbonated species) (Marin et al., 2012) . H\u00fcning et al. (2013) also found no relationship between acidification and gene expression associated with Ca 2+ -ATPase in the mantle of Mytilus edulis, submitted to elevated concentrations of pCO 2 in water (pH 8.03, 7.7, 7.38, 7. 14; 2 months of exposure). This result could be explained by the fact that there are proteins, other than Ca 2+ -ATPase, that participate in the process of calcium uptake and release by the mantle (Li et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2012) . Besides, gills are the tissue that is considered the main organ responsible for capturing calcium ions from the external environment (Fan et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2019) . Thus, the increase in Ca 2+ -AT-Pase in gills of clams exposed to pH 7.6, in comparison to pH 8.1 (Fig. 5 ), might be associated with an attempt by the animal to replenish or maintain its calcium stores due to the possibility of demineralization at low pH. Moreover, despite that the digestive gland is not an organ directly involved in Ca 2+ uptake (Fan et al., 2007) , it needs Ca 2+ for cellular physiological processes (Marig\u00f3mez et al., 2002) . Therefore, at pH 7.6, a decrease in the activity of Ca 2+ -ATPase in the digestive gland would be harmful to homeostasis, ultimately affecting its role in detoxifying xenobiotics.",

The decreased levels of CA activity in the gills of animals exposed to BP3 at pH 7.6, compared to the same treatment at pH 8.1, raise the concern of BP3 harming the shell mineralization, ionic and osmotic regulation and acid-basic balance, since these processes depend on branchial CA activity in clams (Jorge et al., 2016; Roberto et al., 2010; Fonseca et al., 2019) . In the digestive gland, the greater effect of BP3 at pH 8.1, inducing CA activity, when compared to pH 7.6, suggests that the response of the digestive gland to BP3 is suppressed by acidification. Besides, other studies have shown that CA activity decreased after exposure low pH conditions. Moreira et al.

However, we observed no alterations in LPO concentration, suggesting that the tissues analyzed are able to deal with these stressors, BP3 and acidification, after acute exposure and in terms of lipid oxidation. Variations in Ca 2+ -ATPase indicate that this enzyme can be affected by acidification but does not seem to be a target of BP3, at least at 1 \u03bcg/L. However, CA activity was affected by pH and BP3, demonstrating that the risk of ocean acidification and pollution by BP3 is a concern for calcifying organisms, such as the yellow clam A. mactroides. Finally, it is clear that each tissue responded in its own way to BP3, but the gills and digestive gland were more sensitive to this contaminant than mantle. ",

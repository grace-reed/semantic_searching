In this study we compared the thermal bleaching responses of the zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum from three populations along the southeast coast of Florida. Winter (2002-2003) and summer (2003) samples from three geographically separate sites were experimentally exposed to increased temperatures and the loss of zooxanthellae was measured. Population densities of zooxanthellae were analyzed and their genetic identity determined using PCR-DGGE analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region 2. The results showed that samples of P. caribaeorum from reefs that experienced the smallest range in annual seawater temperature released the most zooxanthellae. Seasonal comparisons revealed that winter samples lost more zooxanthellae than summer samples. P. caribaeorum harbored two genetic types of zooxanthellae, C1 and D1a. Individual colonies contained populations of only C1 or D1a, or combinations of C1 and D1a. However, these genotypic patterns did not relate latitudinal distribution nor to differences in experimental thermal tolerance.",

                "text": "The zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum is an abundant cnidarian that occurs throughout shallow coral reef environments of the Caribbean, Bermuda and south Florida, including the Florida Keys. All individuals of P. caribaeorum throughout this range harbor dinoflagellate endosymbionts, commonly called zooxanthellae. Dino-flagellates in the genus Symbiodinium represent the most common of these photosynthetic endosymbionts among coral reef-dwelling cnidarians (Trench, 1997; Rowan, 1998; Baker, 2003) . The presence of Symbiodinium contributes substantially to the productivity, survival, and success of their animal hosts (Muscatine and Porter, 1977) . Zooxanthellae increase the fitness of their scleractinian hosts by enhancing calcification (Barnes and Chalker, 1990) , mediating elemental nutrient flux (D'Elia and Weibe, 1990) , and providing photosynthetically-fixed carbon (Muscatine, 1990) . The algae benefit from a supply of CO and nutrients (Cook et al., 1988) , protection from grazers, and protection from UV damage (e.g. Lesser and Shick, 1989) . The symbiosis between cnidarians and zooxanthellae is also ecologically important, as it contributes to primary productivity of coral reefs (McLaughlin and Zahl, 1959) , aids in recycling and conservation of nutrients (Taylor, 1982; Cook, 1985) , and promotes construction of reef frameworks and habitats by reef-building corals.",

After removal of the polyps from the scintillation vials, each piece of zoanthid was rinsed with FSW, and these rinses were added to the seawater remaining in the vial for subsequent determination of released algae. We found initial complications with the quantitative extraction of symbiotic algae from the P. caribaeorum tissue, due mainly to the large amount of carbonate sediment that these zoanthids assimilate in their tissues. To minimize this problem, zoanthid polyps were transferred to a Petri dish where they were cut into smaller pieces using a scalpel, and then the pieces were sonicated using a Fisher Model 60 Sonic Dismembraner at a power setting of b5 W (RMS) for 3-5 min. This power setting was the highest setting that allowed quantitative analyses of zooxanthellae left in the host. Higher settings tended to break the cell walls of the zooxanthellae (Kemp, personal observation). The sonicated tissue was then homogenized in FSW using a Teflon and glass homogenizer, centrifuged, and the suspended pellet was washed two more times by centrifugation. The final pellet was re-suspended in 5 ml FSW. Numbers of zooxanthellae were determined from 10 replicate haemocytometer counts, which were converted to total numbers.",

A \"touchdown\" amplification protocol with annealing conditions 10\u00b0C above the final annealing temperature of 52\u00b0C was used to ensure PCR specificity. The annealing temperature was decreased by 0.5\u00b0C after each of 20 cycles. Once the annealing temperature reached 52\u00b0C, amplified samples were loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide denaturing gradient gel (45-80% ureaformamide gradient; 100% consists of 7 M urea and 40% deionized formamide) and separated by electrophoresis for 9.5 h at 150 V at a constant temperature of 60\u00b0C (LaJeunesse, 2002) . Samples were run with previously published standards (LaJeunesse, 2002) . The gel was stained with Sybr Green (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's specifications and photographed.",

We pooled the data from all sites at each season, and compared the percent release at 32\u00b0and 34\u00b0. The data were compared in two ways. First, we looked at the release from zoanthids harboring either C1 or D1a symbionts. Since only two zoanthids from the winter samples contained only D1a, this analysis was restricted to the summer samples. Our second approach was to compare all zoanthids with D1a symbionts (including mixed populations) with those without them. Both analyses yielded similar results: there was no relationship between symbiont complement and release (Table 2) .",

Colonies from Palm Beach, the site with the lowest annual mean temperature, were intermediate. The results of Coles et al. (1976) suggested that difference in coral thermal tolerances should correspond with differences in the ambient temperature patterns between geographic areas. Data collected from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and Broward County Department of Planning and Environmental Protection indicate that the monthly mean seawater temperatures of the Lower Keys (i.e. American Shoals) were almost always greater than those at the other sites. This site experienced the least fluctuation in monthly mean seawater temperatures. In addition, the Lower Keys are the only site with a monthly mean seawater temperature greater than 30\u00b0C during the summer. Yet, P. caribaeorum from American Shoals showed the highest levels of zooxanthellae loss when exposed to experimentally increased seawater temperatures. With respect to monthly mean seawater temperature differences, Fort Lauderdale was the intermediate site of the three, but zoanthids from Fort Lauderdale showed the greatest thermal tolerance to an increase in seawater temperature, and in all but one instance (summer at 26\u00b0C) exhibited the lowest percent algae released for both the winter and summer bleaching experiments.",

In northern populations they found A. elegantissima associated with Symbiodinium muscatineii while the southern populations also contained S. californium. Additionally, they often found mixed populations of S. muscatineii and S. californium associating with A. eleganissima at southern collection sites. LaJeunesse and Trench (2000) suggest that the biogeographical distribution of dinoflagellates associated with A. elegantissima might be related to the temperature cline created by latitude. Our PCR-DGGE analysis of the symbiotic algae associated with P. caribaeorum colonies revealed a dynamic assemblage of two different clades of Symbiodinium sp. Colonies with only clade C1 and/or D1a were found in all samples during both winter and summer collections. Additionally, colonies containing both C1 and D1a were found at all sites in both winter and summer. This suggests that any differences that we observed in bleaching responses were not related to genetic differences between the symbionts, at least at the taxonomic level we examined. We do not imply by this that genetic differences between the symbiontsor the hostsare not involved in between-site differences. Unfortunately, we did not examine the identity of symbionts released from polymorphic colonies, so we do not know if selective release had occurred.",

Collections of P. caribaeorum from Caribbean coasts of Mexico and Belize contain C1 (LaJeunesse, 2002) . It has been suggested that members of the D clade of Symbiodinium are opportunistic symbionts that occupy open niches of recently bleached corals that are in the process of recovering. (Baker, 2001 (Baker, , 2003 Baker et al., 2004; Van Oppen, 2001 ). This may explain why Symbiodinium D occurs unpredictably in various scleractinians and other hosts, including the Pacific zoanthid Palythoa caesia (Burnett, 2002) . However, it is now clear that corals in the Caribbean and Florida can recover from bleaching events without the involvement of members of this clade (Thornhill et al., 2006) . Baker (2003) suggests that Symbiodinium D may be a useful tool in monitoring the health of the coral communities by signaling recent and/or recurrent stress events. The abundance of Symbiodinium D1a in summer samples of P. caribaeorum may indicate that the colonies sampled may have recently or are currently under stress and/or in the process of recovering to their steadystate symbiont communities. To date, few studies have examined the physiological associations of Symbiodinium D within hosts (i.e. the \"holobiont\"), but the work of Baker et al. (2004) and Rowan (2004) suggests that members of this clade may have greater thermal tolerances than Symbiodinium C. In our samples of P. caribaeorum, we did not find any indication that colonies with only Symbiodinium D1a were more heat tolerant than those containing Symbiodinium C1 or having mixtures of C1 and D1a.",

One is that there has been little temperature-related selection of symbiont genotypes at the sites in our study, at least for the ITS markers that we used. A second possibility is that environmental or physiological factors other than temperature maintain these host-symbiont populations. For example, niche partitioning between genetic strains of Symbiodinium may occur within P. caribaeorum tissue in response to different light fields (e.g. Rowan and Knowlton, 1995; Baker, 2001) . P. caribaeorum is notable for the amount of particulate inorganic material it contains. Haywick and Meuller (1997) found that P. caribaeorum can assimilate a variety of minerals from the reef, including aragonite, calcite, magnesium calcite, and minor quantities of siliciclastic components. This inorganic material can account for up to 45% of the total biomass, and likely affects the optical properties of the tissue. Enriquez et al. (2005) found symbiotic scleractinian corals to be among the most efficient light collectors in nature, because the massive CaCO 3 skeleton acts as a Lambertian reflector, aiding zooxanthellae in the absorption of solar energy. Although no similar studies have been done with zoanthids, we suggest that the crystalline material in the mesoglea may increase the light field of the zooxanthellae at the colonies' surface while potentially shading symbiont populations within the colonies' interior. Such differences in light field could influence the partitioning of Symbiodinium types in \"optimal\" microhabitats within the host. A third explanation of the bleaching patterns that we observed could be genetic differences between the host populations, rather than of the symbionts.",

One explanation for seasonal differences is that the zoanthids harbored different symbiont populations, but our findings do not support this (Fig. 5) . Rather, it appears that seasonal acclimation of the host or the symbiont is involved. Downs et al. (2002) found elevated levels of antioxidants and heat shock proteins in summer corals, which would reduce the propensity for bleaching. Several studies have shown that corals have greater densities of zooxanthellae in winter months (Stimson, 1997; Fagoonee et al., 1999; Fitt et al., 2001 ). The combination of increased symbiont density and decreased \"host defenses\" would make winter corals (or zoanthids) more susceptible to elevated temperature.",

It is important to note that this study revealed there is an increase/decrease in thermal susceptibilities that correlate to both seasonal changes and local environmental conditions. It is proposed that the dynamic relationship between P. caribaeorum and its symbionts may be partially explained by the possible abundance of microhabitats within P. caribaeorum tissue layers due to the large amounts of sediment found within the mesoglea.",

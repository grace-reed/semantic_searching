In the present study, the stony coral Acropora aculeus was subjected to acute heat stress and entire transcriptomes were sequenced via the next generation sequencing platform. Four paired-end libraries were constructed and sequenced in two groups, including a control and a heat stress group. A total of 120,319,751 paired-end reads with lengths of 2 \u00c2 100 bp were assembled and 55,021 coral-derived genes were obtained. After read mapping and abundance estimation, 9110 differentially expressed genes were obtained in the comparison between the control and heat stress group, including 4465 significantly upregulated and 4645 significantly downregulated genes. Twenty-three GO terms in the Biological Process category were overrepresented for significantly upregulated genes, and divided into six groups according to their relationship. These three groups were related to the NF-kB signal pathway, and the remaining three groups were relevant for pathogen response, immunocyte activation and protein ubiquitination. Forty-three common genes were found in four GO terms, which were directly related to the NF-kB signal pathway. These included 2 NACHT, LRR, PYD domainscontaining protein, 5 nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein, 29 NLRC3-like protein, 4 NLRC5-like protein, and 3 uncharacterized protein. For significantly downregulated genes, 27 overrepresented GO terms were found in the Biological Process category, which were relevant to protein ubiquitination and ATP metabolism. Our results indicate that heat stress suppressed the immune response level via the NLRC3-like protein, the fine-tuning of protein turnover activity, and ATP metabolism. This might disrupt the balance of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis and result in the bleaching of the coral A. aculeus.",

The morphological and physiological response to heat stress is known as coral bleaching [4] , a process whereby stony corals either lose their symbiotic zooxanthellae, or whereby the zooxanthellae's photosynthetic pigments degrade. The resulting disruption of the symbiosis between coral and zooxanthellae causes increased mortality and decreased coral adaptation [5] . In recent years, the increased sea surface temperature has caused severe coral bleaching events both with increasing frequencies and intensities, and stony coral is declining at an unsustainable rate [6] . Coral bleaching has adversely affected the balance and sustainability of coral reef ecosystems, and therefore attracted increasing research attention.",

With respect to the coral, the physiological responses of stony corals to heat stress have been investigated, including the photoprotective mechanisms (MAAs), changes of fluorescent pigments, molecular chaperone mechanisms, apoptosis regulation, and redox equilibrium [7e9] . It has been concluded that oxidative damage due to an excess of oxygen free radicals, could induce coral bleaching during the exposure to elevated temperatures [10, 11] . With respect to zooxanthellae, the susceptibility of stony corals to bleaching has been suggested to relate to the genotype of its symbiotic zooxanthellae, because certain genotypic zooxanthellae were found to tolerate high temperatures [12, 13] . For example, Symbiodinium thermophilum sp. nov. has been considered as a thermotolerant symbiotic zooxanthellae, allowing the survival of corals in the world's warmest sea, the Persian/Arabian Gulf [14] . In addition, it has also been reported that excess symbiotic zooxanthellae increased the susceptibility of stony corals to bleaching [15] . Therefore, coral bleaching is suggested to represent a systemic reaction of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis to heat stress. Its detailed mechanism is complicated, and still far from well understood.",

This stony coral is particularly susceptible to coral bleaching, disease, and predation by the crown-of-thorns starfish. As an approach from systemic biology, the next generation sequencing technology has been applied to significantly expand the transcriptome resources of corals [16e20]. In the present study, the transcriptomic response of the coral A. aculeus to heat stress was investigated with next generation sequencing technology, thus paving a new way to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of coral bleaching and environmental adaption. The purpose of this study was to (1) identify the transcripts from coral A. aculeus, (2) survey differentially expressed genes of corals under acute heat stress, and (3) investigate the potential physiological changes that result from these differentially expressed genes. This enabled to understand the molecular mechanism that underlies heat bleaching of the coral A. aculeus.",

Statistical analysis revealed relative dispersion and parallelism between two repeats per group, suggesting that the transcriptome comparison was of higher statistical confidence. A total of 9110 differentially expressed genes were identified in the comparison between the control and heat stress groups, including 4465 significantly upregulated and 4645 significantly downregulated genes. A gene expression abundance analysis demonstrate that the transcriptome of A. aculeus had been remodeled under heat stress, which might cause pigment loss and result in consequent coral bleaching.

A total of 23 overrepresented GO terms were found at multiple levels in the Biological Process category for the 4465 significantly upregulated genes. These could be divided into six groups according to their relationship. Three groups were related to the NF-kB signal pathway, while the other two groups were relevant to both pathogen response and immunocyte activation. This result indicate that the expression levels of several immune-related genes could be modulated via the NF-kB signal pathway in the coral A. aculeus under heat stress. The NF-kB signal pathway had been reported to be involved in the response to eutrophication and heat stress in the stony corals Galaxea fascicularis and Acropora millepora, respectively [30, 31] . In the present study, a novel modulation mode of the NF-kB signal pathway was revealed in the stony coral under heat stress. In the four overrepresented GO terms, which were at a lower level and directly related to the NF-kB signal pathway, 43 common genes were involved in the negative regulation of the NF-kB signal pathway. Twenty-nine NLRC3-like proteins accounted for 67.4% of all common genes, which had been reported to be negative regulators of innate immune signaling that attenuates Toll-like receptor signaling via modification of the signaling adaptor TRAF6 and the transcription factor NF-kB [32, 33] . Furthermore, the result presented here, was consistent with the observation that TRAF-6 and NF-kB gene expressions were downregulated after exposure to elevated seawater temperatures in the stony coral Acropora aspera [34] . Therefore, our results suggest that heat stress could suppress the immune response of coral A. aculeus via negative regulation of the NF-kB signal pathway by the NLRC3-like protein, which resulted in coral bleaching due to increased susceptibility to pathogenic microorganisms. Several reports in coral O. faveolata and P. damicornis also support a possible suppression of the immune response under heat stress [16, 35] . A suppression of the immune response would result in the susceptibility of the corals to pathogenic microorganisms, and further influencing the balance of coralzooxanthellae symbiosis [36] .",

There was also an ubiquitination-related and overrepresented GO term for significantly upregulated genes. This suggests protein ubiquitination to be dynamically and accurately regulated under heat stress. A finetuned protein ubiquitination might aim to degrade the inactivating proteins induced by heat stress in coral A. aculeus, which was also reported for the corals Porites lobata and Montastraea faveolata in a state of stress [37, 38] . Furthermore, the other two groups of overrepresented GO terms were related to the ATP metabolism. ATP concentrations have been reported to significantly drop in A. hyacinthus during a bleaching event as a result of the natural disturbance [39] . The reduced expression of ATP metabolismrelated genes might result in an alteration of the ATP concentration in A. aculeus, which would further affect the coral energy budget in the stress response. For example, because ATP can supply direct energy to most physiological activities, especially to molecular chaperones, which use this supplied ATP energy to recover the correct conformation of proteins [40] . Therefore, an alteration of the ATP concentration would negatively impact protein repair and degradation in A. aculeus under heat stress. These results indicated that protein ubiquitination and ATP metabolism could be modulated to influence protein metabolism, which would further influence the balance of coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis.",

                "text": "The coral A. aculeus is particularly susceptible to bleaching and disease. In conclusion, we found a repressed level of immune response, a fine-tuned protein turnover activity, and reduced ATP metabolism in coral A. aculeus when subjected to heat stress. These physiological changes might disrupt the symbiotic balance between the stony coral and zooxanthellae, resulting in coral bleaching and eventually, death of the coral A. aculeus. The repression of the immune response leads to disarray of the dynamic maintenance of the type and quantity of symbiotic zooxanthellae, while the invasion risk of pathogenic microorganisms increases considerably [36, 41, 42] . In addition, an increased seawater temperature has been reported to increase the abundance and alter the structure of natural Vibrio populations that are associated with the stony coral [43] . A large number of invasive pathogenic microorganisms compete with the coral and symbiotic zooxanthellae for limited resources, resulting in the loss of the symbiotic zooxanthellae or the degradation of the photosynthetic pigments of the symbiont. This could ultimately result in coral bleaching and death [44] . The fine-tuned protein turnover activity and ATP metabolism might also contribute to a disruption of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiotic balance and an associated burst of coral bleaching, Fig. 6 . Grouping of differentially expressed genes in four overrepresented GO terms (GO:0032088, negative regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity; GO:0043122, regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade; GO:0043124, negative regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade; GO:0007249, I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade) were directly related to the NF-kB signal pathway for significantly upregulated genes in the coral Acropora aculeus under heat stress. since biological metabolism and energy budget are of important significance for normal physiological activity.",

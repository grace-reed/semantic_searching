    "abstract": "The seasonal marine, the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka, 1867), cycles annually between periods of torpor when water temperature is above about 25\u00b0C in summer and active life when temperature is below about 18\u00b0C. This species is a good candidate model organism for studies of environmentally-induced aestivation in marine invertebrates. Previous studies have examined various aspects of aestivation of A. japonicus, however, knowledge of the molecular regulation underpinning these events is still fragmentary. In the present study, we constructed a global gene expression profile of the intestine tissue of A. japonicus using RNA-seq to identify transcriptional responses associated with transitions between different states: non-aestivation (NA), deepaestivation (DA), and arousal from aestivation (AA). The analysis identified 1245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DA vs. NA states, 1338 DEGs between AA vs. DA, and 1321 DEGs between AA vs. NA using the criteria |Log 2 Ratio| \u2265 1 and FDR \u2264 0.001. Of these, 25 of the most significant DEGs were verified by real-time PCR, showing trends in expression patterns that were almost in full concordance between the two techniques. GO analysis revealed that for DA vs. NA, 24 metabolic associated processes were highly enriched (corrected p value b 0.05) whereas for AA vs. NA, 12 transport and metabolism associated processes were significantly enriched (corrected p value b 0.05). Pathways associated with aestivation were also mined, and indicated that most DEGs were enriched in metabolic and signal transduction pathways in the deep aestivation stage. Two up pathways were significantly enriched at the arousal stage (ribosome and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 pathway). A set of key DEGs was identified that may play vital roles in aestivation; these involved metabolism, detoxification and tissue protection, and energy-expensive processes. Our work presents an overview of dynamic gene expression in torpor-arousal cycles during aestivation of A. japonicus and identifies a series of candidate genes and pathways for further research on the molecular mechanisms of aestivation.",

                "text": "Aestivation is a state of dormancy that is well known to be used by terrestrial animals for surviving environmental conditions of high temperature or aridity (Storey and Storey, 2012) . However, aestivation can also occur among marine invertebrate animals although the phenomenon has received little attention to date. The sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka, 1867), a seasonal marine aestivator, cycles annually between periods of torpor when water temperature is above about 25\u00b0C in summer and active life when temperature is below about 18\u00b0C. This species has proved to be a good candidate model organism for studies of environmentally-induced aestivation in marine invertebrates. This species has attracted more and more scientific attention, due to its phylogenetic position (an invertebrate deuterostome) and its special physiological characters (Ji et al., 2008; Ortiz-Pineda et al., 2009; Garc\u00eda-Arrar\u00e1s and Dolmatov, 2010; Sun et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013) . A. japonicus is also an important aquatic species with high commercial and medicinal values in Japan, Korea and north of China (Liao, 1997) . The annual period of aestivation usually lasts more than 4 months with a complete cessation of feeding and locomotion (Li et al., 1996) . During this period the intestine degenerates into a very tiny filament associated with obvious hypometabolism of the whole animal (Li et al., 1996; Yang et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2006) . This undoubtedly shortens the growing cycle of A. japonicus and brings economic losses.",

                "text": "The control of gene expression is crucial for any living organism and identification of the underlying mechanisms that allow organisms to switch between torpor and arousal are common central questions in the study of torpor among different organisms (Morin and Storey, 2009) . Similar to the situation for mammalian hibernation, the transitions from an active non-aestivating state into deep aestivation and then arousal from prolonged aestivation include complex physiological and biochemical reorganization. Studies of gene expression profiles in response to circannual cycles offer an opportunity to understand the basic parts of this reorganization. Although physiological adaptations supporting sea cucumber aestivation have been well-researched (Yang et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2009) , few attempts have been made to evaluate changes in gene transcript levels, and research on the underlying molecular mechanisms of sea cucumber aestivation is only the beginning. For example, Ji et al. (2008) reported that heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) levels decreased during aestivation. Recently, Du et al. (2012) constructed a profile of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the active and aestivating states in sea cucumbers by combining the intestine, respiratory tree and coelomic fluid tissues and applying 454 life sequencing. We sequenced gene expression profile of the intestine from sea cucumbers under different aestivation stage (NA, DA and AA) using Illumina HiSeq\u2122 2000 (BGI, Shenzhen), which provides a better depth of sequencing compared to 454.",

Comparisons are made of three crucial life stages:(1) non-aestivation (NA) animals that have gone through the aestivation period, regenerated their intestinal tissue and returned to active status; (2) deep-aestivation (DA) animals that have stopped feeding and locomotion and the intestine had degenerated into a very tiny string (about 2-3 mm), usually after 15 days of continuous torpor; and (3) arousal from aestivation (AA) after the water temperature was reduced to 18\u00b0C for 2 days and animals showed renewed movement and feeding (feces in the intestine). The Illumina technology used here generated significantly more reads than the previous 454 life sequencing, providing us with much more information; e.g. 1245 DEGs (DA vs. NA), 1338 DEGs (AA vs. DA) and 1321 DEGs (AA vs. NA) were identified as compared with only 446 DEGs identified by Du et al.(2012) . Furthermore, we were able to use the most complete reference library of A. japonicus to date to help annotate our results; this integrated the transcriptome of the regenerative body wall and the intestine constructed by our team (Sun et al., 2011) and another nine transcriptomes including all the tissues of sea cucumbers at different developmental stages (embryo, larva, white juvenile and black juvenile) and under different physiological conditions (Du et al., 2012) . GO and pathway enrichment analysis were also applied to provide an overview of the main functions of the DEGs identified during aestivation. Our results identify the key candidate genes and indicate the potentially significant role of transcriptional regulation in torpor-arousal cycles during aestivation.",

All sea cucumbers were then divided randomly into either control or experimental groups. Sea cucumbers in the control non-aestivation (NA) group were kept at a constant temperature (about 15\u00b0C) throughout the experiment and individuals were sampled at the same times as their corresponding DA or AA group. Animals in the experimental group were slowly induced to aestivation by increasing the water temperature from 15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C at a rate of 0.5\u00b0C per day. A temperature of 25\u00b0C was determined to be the threshold for entering aestivation in our previous study (Yang et al., 2006) . Animals in deep aestivation (DA) were collected after 15 days at 25\u00b0C. Sea cucumbers had stopped feeding, and their movements, if any, were very limited. Other animals were sampled soon after arousing from torpor, after the water temperature was reduced to 18\u00b0C (at a rate of 0.5\u00b0C per day) and moving and feeding were observed in the experimental animals. In the present study, the AA animals were sampled after 2 days back at 18\u00b0C. The whole sampling process has been described in our previous study (Zhao et al., 2013) . At each stage, 15 individuals were sacrificed (NA, DA and AA) and the intestine tissue was rapidly dissected out and frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis.",

The following steps were performed at BGI-Shenzhen including mRNA enrichment, fragment interruption, addition of adapters, size selection, PCR amplification, and RNA-Seq. Briefly, mRNA was separated from the total RNA using oligo(dT) magnetic beads and broken into short fragments (approximately 200 bp) as templates for first strand cDNA and second strand cDNA synthesis. Sequencing adaptors were then ligated to the double stranded cDNA after purifying with a QIAquick PCR extraction kit. The required fragments (about 200-700 bp) were screened using agarose gel electrophoresis and amplified as sequencing templates via PCR.

There were occasionally no reads observed for some DEGs in selected libraries, and this resulted in anomalously high fold-changes for these DEGs in the comparison between libraries. In such cases, then, it was difficult to assess the real difference in DEGs. Therefore, we added the next top 10 DEGs with reads N in both libraries in addition to the top 10 DEGs which had 0 reads in one library. Furthermore, some mapped genes with no reference information in the NCBI database could not be annotated. These unknown genes were hard to analyze and so only annotated and recognized DEGs were listed.

The results showed that 96% (24 out of 25) of the selected genes exhibited similar trends in relative expression levels via the RT-PCR versus RNA-seq methods, although the fold changes measured by the two methods were often inconsistent (Fig. 2) .

Their work provided unprecedented abundance transcriptome information for this species but has been improved in our study in three main ways: a) the sequencing depth of Solexa (our present study) is much greater than for 454 life sequencing, and allowed us to identify 1245 DEGs (DA vs. NA), 1338 DEGs (AA vs. DA) and 1321 DEGs (AA vs. NA) in the present study; b) previous work only focused on non-aestivation and aestivation stages, but ours added crucial information about the early arousal from aestivation and the gene responses needed to return to the active state and to re-proliferate intestinal tissue; and c) our focus on the intestine alone allowed tissue-specific genes to be identified since it is known that stress, disease or physiological states can elicit different gene expression responses by different tissues (Slaugenhaupt et al., 2001; Li et al., 2005) . What's more, we only found 4 DEGs overlap between 446 DEGs (aestivation vs. active) from Du et al.'s and our DA vs. NA comparison.

Several acute phase proteins involving serum amyloid protein A and C-type lectin domain protein precursor were significantly over-expressed in DA vs. NA suggesting that self-defense mechanisms respond to hypometabolism. This is consistent with the results from hibernating animals that found that acute phase proteins (serum alpha2 macroglobulin and haptoglobin) were over-expressed during hibernation (Sheikh et al., 2003; Tsiouris et al., 2004) . When it comes to AA vs. NA, the data indicates that the intestines begin to recover from aestivation quite quickly. This process is similar to the intestine regeneration process in sea cucumbers since they both endured proliferation and development (Sun et al., 2013) . During this process, genes such as tenascin-R, neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 2, and beta-tubulin were up-regulated to promote neurogenesis and neuron regeneration for activating various biological functions during recovery (Fournier and McKerracher, 1997; Roskams et al., 1998; Jones and Jones, 2000; Hansson et al., 2004) . Matriptase, a transmembrane serine protease involved in formation and development of intestinal epidermis (List et al., 2002; Buzza et al., 2010) was also overexpressed during arousal from aestivation, suggesting that the degenerated intestine during aestivation is returning to a state where it is ready to deal with ingested food. The expression level of lactasephlorizin hydrolase also rebounded and this could also indicate that maybe the intestine is renewing its ability to deal with food and glycometabolism is beginning to be re-established in order to provide enough energy for recovery. In addition, many genes in the top DEGs list, such as low-density lipoprotein-related protein and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that are related to intestinal digestion, absorption, and metabolism, also showed obvious changes of expression level during the AA stage.",

Although there were no significantly enriched pathways among up-regulated DEGs in DA vs. NA, the \"fat digestion and absorption\" pathway did attract our attention. Many genes such as Rp2 lipase and triacylglycerol lipase were identified as up-regulated during deep-aestivation, which suggests that A. japonicus may switch to endogenous lipid stores as their principal fuel source during the summer aestivating season. Groom et al. (2013) and Shao et al. (2010) also proposed that animals prefer to use lipid fuels to carbohydrates during hibernation and aestivation (Shao et al., 2010; Groom et al., 2013) . It is no surprise that the \"Ribosome\" pathway was significantly enriched by up-regulated DEGs during AA compared to DA and NA, because protein synthesis is needed for rebuilding an intact and functional digestive system. Another significantly enriched pathway for AA vs. DA is metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, which suggests the importance of body defense during recovery. All activities of the arousal animals including feeding, digesting, normal movement and restoring defense and immune mechanism all require fuel support. Therefore, fuel metabolism related pathways, especially carbohydrate metabolism, were observed to exhibit elevated expression levels during arousal.",

                "text": "Metabolic genes: Metabolic rate depression is a common strategy for many organisms experiencing environmental stress conditions and underlies phenomena including aestivation, hibernation, diapause, and others. Most of the key genes involved in glycolysis, amino acid metabolism and mitochondrial function showed down-regulated trends during deep-aestivation and expression was re-activated during arousal from aestivation (Table 7) . Genes involved in lipolysis showed the opposite expression pattern. These metabolic genes are excellent candidates for further study of the regulation of fuel sources during aestivation. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit Va and NADH dehydrogenase iron-sulfur protein 8, mitochondrial-like isoform 2, which are essential enzymes of the respiratory chain, both showed decreased mRNA levels in our screen during DA, which is consistent with the results reported in aestivating lungfish Protopterus dolloi and Protopterus annectens (Frick et al., 2010; Loong et al., 2012) . Down-regulation of ATP synthase and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was also consistent with mitochondrial quiescence, which was also reported in green-striped burrowing frog, Cyclorana alboguttata, which showed a 67% decrease in ATP synthase activity during aestivation (Hudson et al., 2006) . These results also supported our previous work that showed that A. japonicus suppressed metabolic rate in aestivation as evidenced by a reduced oxygen consumption rate and respire-somatic index (Yang et al., 2006; Ji et al., 2008) . Glycogen is an efficient storage form of glucose and can be used as a metabolic fuel by organisms during torpor. However, glycogen reserves are often low in comparison with the fuel supplies available as lipids and, furthermore, glycogen is often reserved to fuel those tissues that cannot use lipid fuels (e.g. in mammals these typically include the brain and erythrocytes). Similarly, a very low content of glycogen was reported in sea cucumber tissues although a significant increase in tissue glycogen content was found during aestivation (Gao, 2008) . This suggests that glycogen stores may still contribute to energy supply during aestivation although protein and lipid fuels are dominant in sea cucumber tissues. Hexokinase (HK) as a key flux-generating enzyme in the glycolytic pathway (Stryer, 1981) , and in the present study, HK gene expression was down-regulated in the deep-aestivation stage which may suggest that the catabolism of glucose received from extracellular sources is suppressed. Flux-generating enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and citrate synthase (CS), were also down-regulated in the intestine of aestivating sea cucumbers. The increased glycogen levels and decreased expression of HK and PDH both support the idea that carbohydrate catabolism is suppressed in aestivation. Reduced PDH activity is common in other hypometabolic systems including snail estivation and mammalian hibernation (Brooks and Storey, 1992; Storey and Storey, 2007) . Down-regulation of CS indicates an overall suppression of TCA cycle activity and this is similar to the results from aestivating African lungfish (Protopterus dolloi) and land snail (Otala lactea) (Brooks and Storey, 1990; Frick et al., 2008a) .",

The up-regulation of lipase and acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (ACAD) suggested increased lipolysis and \u03b2-oxidation, respectively, during aestivation. We infer that increased lipid oxidation is derived from endogenous reserves, which is supported by Jangoux and Lawrence (1982) , who demonstrated that the intestines of other echinoderms, Trachythyone elongata and Holothuria scabra, were rich in lipids and proteins and these served as energy reserves during aestivation or reproduction periods. FBP 2 (fatty acid binding protein 2, intestinal) that is responsible for assimilation of dietary lipids in the intestine by intracellular transportation of long-chain fatty acids (Albala et al., 2006; Storch and Thumser, 2010) exhibited reduced expression, which is consistent with a general reduction in nutrient uptake/processing capacity of the intestine during aestivation. Genes involved in amino acid metabolism were also down-regulated during sea cucumber deep aestivation such as aspartate aminotransferase and phosphoserine aminotransferase. Contrary to our observations, Frick et al. (2008b) found increased activities of aspartate aminotransferase in African lungfish P. dolloi during aestivation (Frick et al., 2008b) . However, lungfish need to accumulate free amino acids and urea as defenses against osmotic stress in a desiccating environment during aestivation (Schmuck and Linsenmair, 1997; Cartledge et al., 2008) .",

                "text": "Detoxification and tissue protection relevant genes: Defense and protection strategies that respond to aestivation differ in various aestivating species, depending on the environmental stresses involved and the physiological characteristics of tissues/animals. For example, most of the intracellular antioxidant enzymes showed increased expression in brain tissue of aestivating lungfish P. dolloi, whereas significant decreases were detected in the activities of catalase in kidney and hepatopancreas, and glutathione peroxidase in kidney of Helix pomatia snails during aestivation (Nowakowska et al., 2009; Page et al., 2010) . Such contradictions may arise for two reasons: first, different aestivating species may have a preference for different adaptive defense mechanisms, since antioxidant enzymes are only one kind of cellular response to stresses (K\u00fcltz, 2003) ; second, one antioxidant enzyme may play different roles in various tissues and species (Ramos-Vasconcelos and Hermes-Lima, 2003; Nowakowska et al., 2009) . A series of flexible defense strategies seem to have been adopted in aestivating A. japonicus. As shown in Table 8 , the intestine of aestivating A. japonicus retained self-immune defense functions while suppressing a majority of the antioxidant protection genes except for copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) and cytochrome P450. Other researchers also described the up-regulation of SOD expression in different tissues during sea cucumber aestivation (Wang et al., 2011; Du et al., 2012; Klanian, 2013 ). So we can infer that Cu/Zn SOD plays a main role in antioxidant defense and tissue protection during A. japonicus aestivation. It also has been reported that the upregulation of expression of cytochrome P450 genes at moderately elevated temperatures in coral Acropora millepora suggesting that upregulation of cytochrome P450 during aestivation is probably a positive adaptive defense mechanism by A. japonicus in response to heat stress (Rosic et al., 2010) .",

(2008a) and further indicating that immune defense plays important roles in aestivation.",

By reducing the rate of ATP consumption, organisms gain an extension of the time that their fixed endogenous fuel reserves can sustain survival. Ion motive ATPases are major energy consumers in cells; for example, in some cell types, the Na + /K + ATPase ion pump can consume as much as 40% of total ATP turnover (Clausen, 1986) . Not surprisingly, both aestivating snails (O. lactea) and hibernating ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) greatly reduced Na + /K + ATPase activities during hypometabolism (MacDonald and Storey, 1999; Ramnanan and Storey, 2006 ). In the current study, we also detected down-regulated expression of Na + / K + ATPase during deep-aestivation.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that global protein synthesis is inhibited in both vertebrates and invertebrates during aestivation (Fuery et al., 1998; Pakay et al., 2002; Ramnanan et al., 2009; Storey and Storey, 2010) . Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2(eIF2) that brings Met-tRNA i into the ribosome, and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4(eIF4) that mediates the recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA are critical regulatory factors in the translation process (Voorma et al., 1994; Kimball, 1999) . EIF2, eIF4 and several ribosomal proteins all showed decreased expression levels in our study indicating that suppression of protein synthesis occurred in A. japonicus intestine during aestivation. Similar evidence of down-regulation of protein synthesis has also been reported for both frog and snail aestivators (Pakay et al., 2003; Ramnanan et al., 2009) . In A. japonicus, down-regulation of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2I and the proteasome was also detected, indicating that suppression of proteolysis pathways are also important parts of hypometabolism. Similarly, activity of the 20S proteasome was suppressed by 60-80% in hepatopancreas of aestivating O. lactea (Ramnanan et al., 2009) . Suppression of proteolysis during hypometabolism was also indicated by reduced levels of ubiquitinconjugated proteins in response to anoxia in embryos of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana (Anchordoguy and Hand, 1994) .",

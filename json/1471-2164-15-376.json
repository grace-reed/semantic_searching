    "abstract": "Background: We have a limited understanding of genomic interactions that occur among partners for many symbioses. One of the most important symbioses in tropical reef habitats involves Symbiodinium. Most work examining Symbiodinium-host interactions involves cnidarian partners. To fully and broadly understand the conditions that permit Symbiodinium to procure intracellular residency, we must explore hosts from different taxa to help uncover universal cellular and genetic strategies for invading and persisting in host cells. Here, we present data from gene expression analyses involving the bioeroding sponge Cliona varians that harbors Clade G Symbiodinium. Results: Patterns of differential gene expression from distinct symbiont states (\"normal\", \"reinfected\", and \"aposymbiotic\") of the sponge host are presented based on two comparative approaches (transcriptome sequencing and suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH)). Transcriptomic profiles were different when reinfected tissue was compared to normal and aposymbiotic tissue. We characterized a set of 40 genes drawn from a pool of differentially expressed genes in \"reinfected\" tissue compared to \"aposymbiotic\" tissue via SSH. As proof of concept, we determined whether some of the differentially expressed genes identified above could be monitored in sponges grown under ecologically realistic field conditions. We allowed aposymbiotic sponge tissue to become re-populated by natural pools of Symbiodinium in shallow water flats in the Florida Keys, and we analyzed gene expression profiles for two genes found to be increased in expression in \"reinfected\" tissue in both the transcriptome and via SSH. These experiments highlighted the experimental tractability of C. varians to explore with precision the genetic events that occur upon establishment of the symbiosis. We briefly discuss lab-and field-based experimental approaches that promise to offer insights into the co-opted genetic networks that may modulate uptake and regulation of Symbiondinium populations in hospite. Conclusions: This work provides a sponge transcriptome, and a database of putative genes and genetic pathways that may be involved in Symbiodinium interactions. The relative patterns of gene expression observed in these experiments will need to be evaluated on a gene-by-gene basis in controlled and natural re-infection experiments. We argue that sponges offer particularly useful characteristics for discerning essential dimensions of the Symbiodinium niche.",

These associations can have ecological outcomes that are beneficial (e.g., mutualisms) or deleterious (e.g., parasitisms), and as such are among the most important biological interactions on the planet given that they affect everything from general ecosystem health to human disease. However, our understanding of many major facets of the evolutionary and ecological interactions that occur among partners is limited. New molecular tools and a growing genomic perspective are offering the ability to discern nuanced aspects of host:symbiont interactions while identifying genes and pathways involved in regulating host:symbiont relationships [2] . Here, we employed transcriptomic approaches to elucidate the molecular genetic machinery in operation during re-establishment of an intracellular symbiosis.",

The algal partners, known colloquially as zooxanthellae, have long been known to be of vital trophic importance to the host ( [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ). We understand less about the benefits the symbionts receive from the association, though most hypotheses argue that Symbiodinium benefit from intracellular residency by gaining access to nutrients that are limiting outside the host (e.g. [11] [12] [13] ). The partnership is arguably the most important ecological interaction that occurs in shallow tropical habitats worldwide because Symbiodinium spp. energetically subsidize the entire ecosystem and power calcification processes [14] that generate the topographic complexity of these systems.",

Symbionts can be lost from the host through a process known as bleaching, which can have significant deleterious effects on the host [17] . There is growing concern among scientists about what the potential disruption of this important symbiosis means for the future of coral reefs (e.g. [18] [19] [20] ). In the face of these concerns, it has become apparent that significant gaps exist in our basic comprehension of the natural dynamics of the Symbiodinium:host interaction, and in the degree of cellular and genetic integration among partners. Hosts can recover from mild and even massive losses of their symbiont populations, though mortality rates of the hosts increase under both scenarios, especially the latter [21] . Symbiodinium spp. are also capable of (in fact probably require) existence outside of the host, and Symbiodinium spp. have planktonic, free-living stages that occur even during non-bleaching events (e.g. [22, 23] ).",

In the broadest terms, we lack a clear understanding of how Symbiodinium navigates a potential host's cellular and molecular genetic machinery so that digestion, detection and expulsion are avoided; we also lack a clear understanding of what role the host might play in permitting intracellular residency. Recent advances in molecular and genomic approaches have enhanced our understanding of some of the regulatory operations executed between cnidarian hosts and zooxanthella symbionts (e.g. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] ). Molecular genetic data has failed to identify \"symbiosis-specific\" genes that regulate the interaction between partners, but instead has found subtle differences in expression patterns that depend on holobiont context. For example, symbiont cladal identity has been shown to play an important role in transcriptomic profiles [28] . Emphasis has now shifted toward finding the cellular pathways that are modulated such that Symbiodinium maintain their position within the host cell or a particular type of tissue (e.g. [27, 30, 34] ).",

Non-cnidarian systems also offer some empirical and comparative advantages over cnidarian hosts (e.g., the ability to create intracellular associations in hosts that have no evolutionary history of symbiotic associations with Symbiodinium [48] , the ability to compare genetic expression profiles in congeneric species that differ in their ability to form symbioses with Symbiodinium (e.g., C. delitrix versus C. varians), and the ability to produce aposymbiotic cell aggregates (e.g. [43] ) that can then be exposed to Symbiodinium under precisely controlled conditions). In this context, we present C. varians as a useful tool to better understand the Symbiodinium niche sensu lato as well as to achieve a high level of resolution of genetic regulation in sponge:Symbiodinium and all intracellular associations.",

The \"aposymbiotic\" explants can then be reared in lighttight containers supplied with continuously flowing seawater. We were able to maintain \"aposymbiotic\" tissue of C. varians forma varians for months under these conditions. We discovered we were able to restore the symbiotic condition by exposing \"aposymbiotic\" explants to recently extracted homologous Symbiodinium (Figure 1 ). Explants from \"aposymbiotic\" tissue were able to take up symbionts, and after 5 days showed signs of reinfection. Thus, we were able to identify three types of sponge tissue that had different symbiont states (\"normal\", \"reinfected\", and \"aposymbiotic\" - Figure 1 ).",

Each pool of RNA used for subsequent sequencing of the three tissue types was derived from at least three different sponge samples, but these were pooled into a single batch for each symbiont state prior to next generation sequencing. Thus, the sequences we present below come from non-replicated sequence runs (see Methods section). This caveat becomes important when interpreting the putative differences we observed. We recognize a preferable approach would be to sequence several distinct and independent samples from each symbiont state. However, this was a pilot study to determine the feasibility of using C. varians to study Symbiodinium symbioses, and used several approaches (e.g., transcriptomics, suppressive subtractive hybridization (see below)) to assess molecular genetic regulation. At the time we sequenced the transcriptomes, costs associated with sequencing multiple replicates were prohibitive. Furthermore, best practices associated with RNASeq experiments were just being developed (e.g. [49] ). Nonetheless, the success we achieved in obtaining high quality sequences indicated that the database we present below will be a useful resource for the community as future studies attempt to discern significant differences observed at various stages of the establishment and maintenance of Symbiodinium symbioses.",

The quality of the reads was highly similar across treatments: most reads with average phred score of 36, GC content from 42 to 44%, and the levels of sequence duplication varying only from 81% in \"normal\" to 89% \"reinfected\" treatment ( Table 1 ). Before the de novo assembly, between 9 million and 34 million reads were trimmed in the separate datasets ( Table 1 ). The number of bases assembled in contiguous sequences (contigs) was always over 21 Mb. The number of contigs ranged from 51,020 in \"reinfected\" to 202,907 in \"normal\" treatments with average contig sizes > 400 bp in all cases (Table 1) . The major differences between numbers of contigs in \"reinfected\" vs \"normal\" states were due to small contigs (between 200-400 bp). The N50 for each treatment was always close to 500 bp ( Table 1 ). The number of assembled reads and size in megabases of the dataset, as well as the number and size of contigs in all datasets, was similar to recent transcriptomic datasets published from two demosponges (Petrosia ficiformis and Crella elegans) obtained with similar methodologies ( [50, 51] ). Transcriptomic sequences were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (see Availability of Supporting Data Section below). For non-model organisms sequenced de novo, it is typical that fewer than 50% of the contigs return hits against the Genbank Metazoa database when the BLAST algorithm is employed ( [50] [51] [52] ). For the \"reference\" dataset (Table 1) , 61,340 sequences returned BLAST hits against Metazoa -12% of those were specifically poriferan; another 15% were to other Metazoa (Figure 2A ). Bacteria (29,908 sequences) and Protozoa (20,067 sequences -including 4,008 sequences against Symbiodinium spp.) were also recovered ( Figure 2A ). Symbiodinium sequences recovered included the genes cytochrome oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b (always with e-value 1e-05), which were assigned to the following taxa: Symbiodinium goreaui (Genbank accession: ABK5409), S. microadriaticum (ABK57993), Protodinium simplex (AEM91635), Pelagodinium beii (AEM91636), Polarella glacialis (AEM91637), Symbiodinium sp. cultured from Aiptasia sp. (AAM9012), Symbiodinium sp. from Acrozoanthus australiae (APD02933), Symbiodinium sp. from Palythoa mutuki (ACA30467), and Symbiodinium sp. from Zoanthus vietnamensis (ACA30462).",

Alternatively, this pattern could point to an actual molecular genetic response to the onset of symbiosis in the form of global-or chromatin-level gene regulation (e.g. [24, 25] ).

Several of these categories were identified in our study, and included GO terms like metabolic and cellular processes, biological regulation, binding, and intracellular components ( Figure 3A) . A pairwise enrichment analysis of the GO terms obtained for each treatment using the Metazoa database recovered several significantly enriched terms ( Figure 3B ). Among the enriched GO terms in \"reinfected\" compared to \"aposymbiotic\" treatments are organelle (membrane bounded and intracellular membrane bounded), biological regulation, macromolecule catabolic process, cytoplasm, regulation of cellular process, lipid metabolic process (and cellular lipid metabolic process), response to chemical stimulus, transport, and protein binding. These categories are targets for future exploration of processes and mechanisms important in host: symbiont interactions. We found that the \"reinfected\" treatment often contained more bacterial and metazoan GO term assignments than the other two treatments ( Figure 3A , C, and D; Additional file 3: Figure S2 ). Protozoan GO term assignments, on the other hand, were usually reduced in \"reinfected\" tissue ( Figure 3C , Additional file 3: Figure S2 ). Several categories in the metazoan GO term assignments showed more sequences derived from the \"normal\" treatment (e.g., multicellular organismal process, biosynthetic processes, gene expression, translation, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, ion transport, and mitochondrion organization - Figure 3A ). GO assignments using the bacterial and the protozoan databases showed different trends ( Figure 3 ; Additional file 3: Figure S2 ), but it is not clear how these relate to the presence or absence of Symbiodinium populations in C. varians. Attempting to discern how these interacting systems influence one another would provide an intriguing line of research, but goes beyond the capacity of the current study.",

Eighty-six of the genes were at significantly higher levels in \"reinfected\" tissues (23 metazoan) while 74 were significantly higher in \"aposymbiotic\" tissue (42 metazoan - Figure 4B ; Additional file 2: Table S1 ). While many genes were expressed at different levels in \"reinfected\" vs. \"normal\" tissue, DESeq analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in expression values. Gene Ontology treemaps that display hierarchical data using nested rectangles (see [56] ) reveal that some of the genes expressed at higher levels in the \"aposymbiotic\" treatment (compared to \"normal\") were particularly interesting in the context of symbiosis (Additional file 4: Table S4 ; Figure 5 top). Within the broad \"cell cycle\" category, processes such as cell communication and signaling as well as trans-membrane transport may highlight a response by the host to the presence or absence of a putative symbiont. Another notable GO category had to do with \"protein translation,\" broadly defined, and included DBH-like monooxygenase 1, which is involved in the catecholamine metabolic process, and sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, mitochondrial-like (SQR), which encodes an enzyme that oxidizes sulfide to thiosulfate. SQR is a potentially important enzyme because sulfide is produced endogenously in several tissues of marine invertebrates [57] , and may be related to sulfide-oxidizing bacteria [58] .

GO categories related to generalized stress are shown. Colors as in A. come from genes up-regulated in \"reinfected\" compared to \"aposymbiotic\" tissue. Over 80% of the contigs in the transcriptome that aligned with our SSH clones showed a trend of increased expression in \"reinfected\" tissue compared to \"aposymbiotic\" tissue as expected (Additional file 7: Table S3 ). None of the SSH genes were expressed at lower levels in \"reinfected\" tissue compared to \"aposymbiotic\" tissue. However, 9 SSH clones (16.1% of all clones) that corresponded to 7 of the SSH genes revealed contig expression patterns that were both higher and lower in \"reinfected\" compared to \"aposymbiotic\" tissue. Thus, we are unable to confirm that these genes show increased expression upon uptake of Symbiodinium (Additional file 7: Table S3 ). It is important to note, however, that these results are expected given that SSH methods using PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction (Clontech) have a false positive rate that is caused by the presence of remnant cDNAs common to both tester (\"reinfected) and driver (\"aposymbiotic) samples. We also note that possible false positives in this type of SSH can depend can depend on a variety of factors including RNA quality, mRNA abundance, and performance of the subtraction. This was, to our knowledge, the first time this technique has been applied to poriferan systems, and we had no other studies to compare our efficiencies. We also validated the differential expression patterns we observed for a subset of the animal-specific clones by RT-PCR followed by gel electrophoresis and/or relative qRT-PCR ( Figure 9 ). Of the genes with higher expression values in C. varians upon infection with Symbiodinium, we found that several genes that play documented roles in host phagosomes (e.g., Vacuolar sorting protein, Nup50, calcium-binding protein) and host immune responses (ficolin, gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal protein) were represented ( Table 2) . We highlight, however, that any candidate genes identified in this study (by SSH or transcriptomic analysis) should be subjected to rigorous evaluation on a gene-by-gene basis in controlled and natural re-infection experiments with multiple biological replicates, as well as in functional experiments, before their role(s) in Symbiodinium-symbioses can be confirmed and delineated.",

Few studies have correlated gene expression profiles with symbiont population dynamics under ecologically realistic conditions, and we were interested in determining whether we could do this using genes identified above. Thus, our natural reinfection experiment may represent a methodological advance in Symbiodinium research. Cliona varians provides a useful model to study temporal aspects of reinfection dynamics in Symbiodinium associations because we demonstrate algal densities and locations can be monitored precisely. We detected very few Symbiodinium cells in C. varians tissue during the first 7 days in the field (Figure 10 ). By the 8 th day, we observed a small number of Symbiodinium-like cells, and after the 12 th day the symbionts repopulated aposymbiotic sponges at a nearly exponential rate ( Figure 10B) . The presence of the algae within the tissue was skewed towards the surface layer after 1 month in the field ( Figure 10C ). After 16 d, the symbionts rapidly increased their populations and recovered nearly normal concentrations of Symbiodinium by 128 d. We typed the Symbiodinium populations using 23S rDNA sequences (see [13] ) and exclusively found G Clade algae (data not shown). As a test of this experimental system, we correlated gene expression profiles for vacuolar sorting protein and NUP50 (given their possible roles in an arrested phagosome) with Symbiodinium population dynamics within the host. We identified interesting temporal patterns in gene expression using qRT-PCR. Expression patterns differed for each gene at days 0, 2, 6, 12, 18, and 48 ( Figure 10D ). It was particularly intriguing that vacuolar sorting protein had elevated expression near the onset of rapid Symbiodinium population growth (i.e., around day 18). This represents the earliest stages of discerning nuanced aspects of host:symbiont integration at the genetic level. Additional experiments on other key genes are needed, but our results indicate that the tools are available to precisely describe the nature of the symbiosis at the finest level of genetic resolution.",

Sponges may be exceptionally useful systems of study in this context. Specifically, the temporal variability seen in expression dynamics under natural conditions in the field highlight how nuanced the interaction between the host and symbiont is likely to be, and how much work remains to uncover detailed perspectives on the associations. Through this and related work, it appears possible to identify some common pathways that Symbiodinium may co-opt to gain entry and to procure residency in a variety of potential hosts. Nonetheless, clear explanatory hypotheses are needed so that we can better understand, and prepare for, changes in the symbiosis that are likely with the rapid shifts in temperature and sea-water chemistry that will accompany global climate change [13, 65, 66] . We also require more detailed knowledge of the interaction between symbiotic partners. We argue that sponge: Symbiodinium associations add important perspectives on the Symbiodinium niche, which will foster greater understanding in other host environments.",

In accordance with policies established by the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, we collected sponges under permit FKNMS-20070094-A1 and under a Florida recreational resident saltwater fishing license issued from Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Sponges were transported to shallow raceways where the Symbiodinium-dense pinacodermal region was removed with a sharp razorblade (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). The Symbiodinium devoid choanosome explants were placed in a lightproof container (\u224860 L total volume) to heal for several months where they received fresh seawater from an underground aquifer, which is unlikely to contain free-living Symbiodinium, at a rate of approximately 2 L min \u22121 . Small explants (\u22486-8 cm 3 ) of the \"aposymbiotic\" sponges were then exposed to Symbiodinium that had been freshly isolated from C. varians forma varians (Figure 1 ). After 5 days, signs of reinfection were visible to the naked eye (Figure 1) . At this point, tissue was harvested, placed in 1.5 ml tubes, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and immediately stored at \u221280\u00b0C until mRNA was extracted.",

Since sponges host a wide variety of symbiotic organisms within their tissues, mainly bacteria and protozoans, that cannot be completely removed prior to cDNA construction, we performed separate BLAST searches against three different individual databases containing proteins of Metazoa, Protozoa, and Bacteria, to estimate the amount of contigs belonging to either symbionts or the sponge. Such searches were performed for the \"normal\", \"aposymbiotic\", and \"reinfected\" transcriptome datasets and the contigs showing hits against two or all the databases were counted. All BLAST searches were conducted with BLAST v2.2.23+ [67] using an e-value cut-off of 1e-5. With the resulting file, we then used Blast2GO v2.5.0 (Conesa et al.

The total number of unambiguously mapped reads (i.e., \"unique genes\") of each treatment compared to the \"reference\" transcriptome was exported as a table to use as count data in further analyses. Differential expression values were computed with the DESeq package [55] in Bioconductor in R. We performed three different comparisons to find genes up-regulated in each treatment: \"normal\" versus \"aposymbiotic\", \"aposymbiotic\" versus \"reinfected\", and \"normal\" versus \"reinfected\". We first estimated the effective library size, and then estimated the data's dispersion and mean to identify differentially expressed genes. Due to the lack of non-pooled biological replicates for transcriptome sequences, we instructed the program to ignore the condition (i.e., \"treatment\") labels and estimated variance by treating all samples as if they were replicates of the same condition. This approach follows that outlined in Anders [55] . Comparisons were accepted to be significant at an FDR adjusted value of 0.01. Only significant values were plotted as a heatmap using the R heatmap.2 function from the R 'gplots' library. We used the default hclust hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster the rows.

In addition, for overall comparisons of the expression profiles of the three treatments of C. varians, heat maps were obtained with CLC Genomics Workbench 5.1 by mapping the raw reads of each treatment dataset against the total \"reference\" contig list (292,182 contigs). Contigs of the \"reference\" dataset whose size exceeded 1000 bp (N = 15,636 sequences) were represented in detail to ensure full length. Expression was measured in RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads). Since no reference genome is available for C. varians, exons were not annotated for the analysis, and in turn, the assembled contigs were assigned a complete exon. We generated another heat map that included genes that had differences between RPKM among treatments of 2 (N = 13,773 sequences).

Poly A + mRNA was isolated from three biological replicates of C. varians aposymbiotic and reinfected tissue using the Micro-FastTrack 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) and pooled before cDNA synthesis of RNA, which was performed using the Super Smart cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech). cDNA from reinfected tissue was used as the tester and cDNA from aposymbiotic tissue was used as the driver for the forward subtraction reactions. PCR products generated from the subtracted library, representing mRNAs putatively over-expressed in reinfected tissue, were sub-cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector using OneShot TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen) and plasmids were prepared using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Sequencing of 173 individual clones from the subtracted library was performed on an ABI 3130 \u00d7 L Genetic Analyzer at Virginia Commonwealth University's sequencing facility. Sequences were searched using the blastx and tblastx algorithms in the Genbank database. To validate that a subset of the identified genes were differentially expressed, RNA was isolated from aposymbiotic and reinfected C. varians using the RNeasy\u00ae Mini Kit (Qiagen), limiting genomic DNA contamination through an additional on-column DNase I treatment. cDNA was synthesized from equal amounts of sponge mRNA (125-200 ng/\u03bcl) using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligodT primer. In some cases, RT-PCR was conducted followed by gel electrophoresis to allow visual inspection of differential gene expression. In other cases, SYBR Green (Invitrogen) chemistry and Chromo4 (BioRad) were used to obtain relative levels of expression by qRT-PCR. Expression levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene Ef1a that qRT-PCR showed to be consistently expressed at high levels in both sets of tissues. For all qRT-PCR experiments, duplicates were performed from master mixes, and in most cases each experiment was repeated twice. Threshold values for Ct calculation were manually selected for all samples by placing the threshold line at the intersection where the signal intensities of the fluorescence traces surpassed background levels and began to increase (i.e., the linear portion of the curve). Both data and standard graphs were considered when establishing the position of the threshold line to optimize efficiency. Reaction efficiencies were recorded as efficiency per well in the linear range of the Ct and two points above. Standard curves, using plasmid dilutions of known quantities as templates, were generated for each gene in each qPCR experiment. Efficiency-corrected Ct values were compared to these curves (based on log of standard DNA concentration vs. Ct value for each sample) to calculate relative concentrations of samples using Opticon Monitor software (BioRad). The relative concentration values of duplicates were averaged and experimental averages were normalized to Ef1a values.",

The explants were transported to the lab within 30 min of collection where they were immediately processed for subsequent work. One section of each explant was immediately placed in RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent from QIAGEN (for gene expression analyses), and stored overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next morning, RNAlater was drained from the tube, and the tissue was frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. A second section was snap frozen for DNA isolation. Another two sub-sections were taken from each explant and fixed in either a 4% paraformaldehyde: 2.5% gluteraldehyde solution (for electron and light microscopy work) or a 3.7% formaldehyde solution (for zooxanthella cell counts). Tissues were stored at 4\u00b0C, and after 24 h, the gluteraldehyde-containing samples were transferred to filter sterilized seawater and stored at 4\u00b0C until embedding, sectioning and visualization. Three randomly chosen C. varians individuals were sampled from the flats to serve as controls and were processed in the same manner described above. Differential expression of two genes (nup50 and vacuolar sorting protein) as a function of time posttransplantation was assessed by qRT-PCR as described above, however, expression values are plotted relative to time 0 after normalization to the housekeeping gene Ef1a. We selected nup50 and vacuolar sorting protein because they showed strong levels of up-regulation in reinfecting tissue, and thus represented robust candidates to demonstrate that this empirical approach would be a useful tool to test gene expression hypotheses generated by the transcriptome and SSH databases.",

Symbiodinium were visualized with a TX-RED filter (936 ms exposure) while SYBR green-stained nuclei could be distinguished using the FITC filter (1302 ms exposure). Symbiodiniumdepth within sponge tissue was determined by stitching together successive images starting at the pinacoderm and moving deeper into the choanosome with Adobe Photoshop. Algal cells were counted in triplicate along microtransects (5 \u03bcm by 10 \u03bcm) that ran 3 cm into the choanosome. Total Symbiodinium cell counts were performed with formaldehyde-fixed samples.

Meiosis is complex, as after replication of a diploid genome to make sister chromatids of each DNA molecule, the cell divides the genetic material twice. The first is a reductive cell division, in which pairs of homologous chromosomes are separated into two different haploid daughter cells. Each of these two daughters then separates the sister chromatids, using a mechanism essentially identical to a mitotic cell division, e-mail david.morse@umontreal.ca to produce four gametes. The independent segregation of homologous chromosomes, coupled with crossing-over events that occur during prophase of the first meiotic division, generates a population of gametes with an high genetic diversity. A hypothesis to explain the pervasiveness of meiosis among organisms is that the resulting increase in genetic diversity allows populations to better resist parasitic infections -this hypothesis is supported by both observations of natural populations and laboratory experiments (Lively and Morran 2014) .",

                "text": "Despite the many studies on model systems, non-model organisms and dinoflagellates in particular are much less studied. It is clear that at least some dinoflagellate species are able to undergo meiosis. In Lingulodinium, fusion between two hap-loid gametes of different sexual types leads to formation of a diploid cell called a hypnozygote, which can form either resting cysts (under nutrient deficiency) or sexual cysts (formed in nutrient replete conditions) (Bravo and Fiigueroa 2014) . Lingulodinium was also used for mating experiments between clonal lines to show the presence of only two sexual types (Fiigueroa and Bravo 2005) . In Alexandrium, 4C cells were identified cells using imaging flow cytometry (Fiigueroa et al. 2015) . In older studies with Peridinium, hypnozygotes with four nuclei following gamete fusion were reported (Pfiester 1976) , and two successive divisions of a planozygote, suggestive of meiosis were reported in several species (von Stosch 1973) . However, it is far from clear that all species are capable of sex, including the coral symbiont Symbiodinium. Symbiodinium has come under increased scrutiny because meiotic recombination may augment the functional diversity of symbionts and produce some strains more resistant to coral bleaching (Suggett et al. 2017) .",

Several studies have queried sequence databases for the presence of genes known to be involved in meiosis. One query database containing 51 meiotic genes (Schurko and Logsdon 2008) showed that 31 of these were found in Symbiodinium (e-values < 10 \u22124 ) (Chi et al. 2014) . A more recent re-examination of Symbiodinium for presence of these same 51 meiotic genes reported that between 46 to 48 genes were present depending on the species (Liu et al. 2018) . However, the discrepancy between the two studies was not addressed, and in neither case was the conservation of these genes among different dinoflagellates explored.",

One of the dinoflagellates chosen, Lingulodinium polyedra, is known to undergo meiosis (Fiigueroa and Bravo 2005) . We further evaluated the presence of these genes in phylogenetically related protists, including apicomplexans, ciliates and diatoms, reasoning that absence of a gene among all these protists would reflect merely that the gene is not needed rather than being an impediment to the meiotic process in dinoflagellates. Similarity in gene content on the other hand would suggest the dinoflagellates are as likely to undergo meiosis as are the apicomplexans (Fritz et al. 2012; Guttery et al. 2012 ; O'Hara and Chen 2011), the ciliates (Loidl and Lorenz 2016) and the diatoms (Chepurnov et al. 2004) . A comparison of the meiotic gene repertoire shows that the dinoflagellates Lingulodinium and Symbiodinium are practically identical. Furthermore, both show considerable similarity to other protists where meiosis has also been documented. These analysis thus support an ability of Symbiodinium to undergo genetic recombination.",

In this analysis, yeast genes that give significant hit to a S. kawagutii transcriptome are colored red. There are a few notable absences in this regulatory schema. First, the regulatory protein securin (Pms1p) is not found. Securin normally acts to prevent the transition from metaphase to anaphase by inhibiting the protease separin (Esp1p). However, it must be noted that securin is not found in any of the other protists tested, and furthermore, is also absent from fission yeast (Supplementary Material Table  S1 ). Second, some elements of the cohesin complex holding homologous chromosomes together (Rec8p and Irr1p) are absent. This may suggest that dinoflagellate chromosomes also require alternative partners to Smc1p/Smc3p in the cohesin complex, although again, these two sequences are also absent in the majority of the other protists tested (Supplementary Material Table S1 ). Lastly, elements of the pachytene checkpoint, in particular the synapsis proteins Hop1p and Red1p, as well as the Sum1p transcription factor activated by them, are not present. This last is not surprizing, since there is no conservation of other budding yeast cell cycle-related transcription factor genes (including Ndt80 and Ime1) in other species.",

To assess how well gene presence in S. kawagutii reflected what is observed in other protists, the subset of genes whose prod- ucts are involved in recombination was also used to query apicomplexan, ciliate and diatom databases.

We observe here that the degree of similarity to budding yeast genes in BLAST searches is very similar between the different protists. Other than the apicomplexans, most of the protists surveyed have roughly 50% of the budding yeast meiotic gene repertoire, while fission yeast has genes similar to 66% of the budding yeast gene repertoire (Table 1 ). In particular, the similarity between Symbiodinium gene inventories and what is observed with the other protists clearly supports the notion that the recombination machinery is sufficient to support meiosis in this dinoflagellate. It was interesting to note that the group of genes implicated in formation of the yeast synaptonemal complex suggests that almost all are missing (Fig. 1, Supplementary Material Fig. S2 ). Among these, the only highly conserved gene is the topoisomerase (Top1), as the Mnd1 gene has only a weak similarity to the yeast query. However, this is a characteristic shared by all other protists tested ( Supplementary Material Fig. S1 ), and is thus unlikely to reflect any adaptations to the particularities of dinoflagellate chromosomes (Wong 2019). The genes encoding structural maintenance of chromosomes (Smc) proteins, ATPases that act as either cohesins (Smc1 and Smc3) or condensins (Smc2 and Smc4), were not listed as part of the synaptonemal complex, but are present and highly conserved over all the organisms surveyed (Supplementary Material Fig. S2 ).",

One study (Chi et al. 2014 ) recovered 31 of the 51 genes using a genome derived protein list of S. minutum (Shoguchi et al., 2013) while a second (Liu et al. 2018 ) recovered between 46 and 48 genes depending on the Symbiodinium species (47 for S. minutum). However, our BLAST searches with the same toolkit genes found only 31 of the 51 sequences in our S. kawagutii transcriptome assembly. While the reason for the discrepancy between the different analyses of S. minutum is unknown, we conclude the lower proportion of the meiotic gene toolkit genes appears more likely. It should be noted that the 31 of 51 genes found here in S. kawagutii are not all identical to the 31 of genes found in S. minutum. Hop2, BRCA1, Ku80 and Sae2 were found in S. minutum but not in S. kawagutii, while Mer3, Dna2, Mph1 and Msh3 were not found in S. minutum but were found here. Overall, the agreement between the two species is 84%. We also note that for the most part, the genes missing in S. kawagutii are also missing when BLAST searches are performed with the NCBI transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) database limited to dinoflagellates.",

The full list, along with the best e-value hits for all searches, can be found in Supplementary Material Table S1 . When two or more yeast genes gave hits to the same transcriptome sequence, the transcriptome sequence was placed only once and corresponded to that with the best (smallest) e-value. The yeast gene list was 402 D.

S. kawagutii has been renamed Fugacium kawagutii (LaJeunesse et al. 2018) but for simplicity the name Symbiodinium is used here.

Depending on the target database, either BLASTp or tBLASTn was used, both with a cut-off of 1e \u221205 . The best BLAST hit e-value was recorded for each screen. Yeast genes without hits in the three dinoflagellate assemblies above were also tested using tBLASTn to query the TSA database at NCBI (limited to dinoflagellates).",

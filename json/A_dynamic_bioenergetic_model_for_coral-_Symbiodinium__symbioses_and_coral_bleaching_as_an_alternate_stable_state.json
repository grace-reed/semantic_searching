However, the complex symbiotic metabolism of corals is vulnerable to disruption by numerous anthropogenic environmental perturbations, jeopardizing their future persistence. In order to understand and predict responses of corals to complex changes in their environment, a mechanistic understanding of how multiple interacting factors drive the individual and emergent physiology of both symbiotic partners is necessary. Such a task is well suited for theoretical modeling frameworks such as Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory ( Kooijman, 2010 ) , although the complexity of such theory makes these effort s inaccessible to many biologists ( Jager et al., 2013 ) . In order to bridge this gap, we present here a simplified dynamic bioenergetic model for coral-Symbiodinium symbioses that aims to mechanistically integrate the impacts of complex environmental change on the physiological performance of reef corals, including responses to environmental stress.",

                "text": "1. Develop a new module of photo-oxidative stress. Of primary interest to coral biologists and ecologists is symbiosis dysfunction under environmental stress, resulting in coral \"bleaching\" -the loss of algal symbionts from the association ( Jokiel and Coles, 1977 ) . Bleaching is thought to be triggered by photooxidative stress in Symbiodinium ( Weis, 2008 ) , which has been modeled previously as a response to absolute external irradiance ( Eynaud et al., 2011 ) . However, this response may also depend on self-shading by other symbionts ( Enr\u00edquez et al., 2005 ) , CO 2 availability at the site of photosynthesis ( Wooldridge, 2009 ) , and other non-photochemical quenching mechanisms ( Roth, 2014 ) . We incorporate these features into a new photooxidative stress module linking overreduction of the photosynthetic light reactions to downstream impacts of photoinhibition and photodamage. Importantly, this formulation introduces a link between CO 2 -limitation of photosynthesis and bleaching, and potential synergistic roles for heterotrophy and nutrient availability in influencing bleaching responses ( Wooldridge, 2014b ) . 2. Reduce theoretical and mathematical complexity. Following the logic of Jager et al. 2013, we exclude certain features of formal DEB theory in order to capture behaviors of interest with the simplest possible formulation. Here, we present a model without reserves, maturity, or reproduction (see Kooijman, 2010 ) . This formulation precludes modeling the full life cycle of corals as reproduction, larval stages, and metamorphosis are not considered, but greatly reduces theoretical complexity and parameter numbers, which is advantageous given the relative paucity of data for corals. Moreover, dynamics of the symbiosis (i.e., changes in symbiont to host biomass, including bleaching and recovery) and coral biomass growth are efficiently captured with this simpler formulation, which also increases accessibility for biologists and ecologists without requiring expertise in DEB theory. 3. Provide well-documented, open source code. In order to facilitate the continued development and application of theoretical modeling tools for coral symbioses, we provide access to the model in the form of an R package called coRal ( github.com/jrcunning/ coRal ), which users may install to run and visualize model simulations. With an accessible and modular framework, we envision this code base as a resource for further development by the scientific community to include additional complexity and problem-specific components. We chose R ( R Core Team, 2014 ) , an open source programming language in common use by biologists and ecologists, to reach the widest possible audience with this work.",

An emergent finding of this work is that coral bleaching can be interpreted as an alternate stable state of the symbiotic system, which provides a new framework for understanding the mechanisms that drive a coral into a bleached state, as well as those that facilitate recovery.

The symbiont fixes carbon through photosynthesis and receives nitrogen shared by the host, while the host acquires nitrogen from the environment and receives carbon shared by the symbiont. A graphical representation of the model is presented in Fig. 1 , and each model flux and parameter is defined in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. We use C-moles (C-mol) as the unit of biomass for consistency with the rigorous mass balance of DEB theory: 1 C-mol is equivalent to the amount of biomass containing 1 mol of carbon atoms. Host biomass (expressed as C-mol H), symbiont biomass (expressed as C-mol S), and prey biomass (expressed as C-mol X) have fixed, but different, molar N:C ratios ( Table 2 ) , consistent with the assumption of strong homeostasis in DEB theory ( Kooijman, 2010 ) . Biomass is produced from carbon and nitrogen by parallel complementary synthesizing units (SUs) -mathematical specifications of the formation of a product by a metabolic network processing two complementary substrates in parallel ( Kooijman, 2010 , p. 105, Fig. 3.7) . The two state variables in the model are symbiont biomass and coral biomass; because resources are acquired proportionally to surface area, and surface area is proportional to volume (corals are V1-morphs in a DEB context ( Kooijman, 2010 , Table 1 Model fluxes (mass-specific). Units are explained in the text. (Abbreviations: CCMs = carbon concentrating mechanisms; NPQ = non-photochemical quenching; ROS = reactive oxygen species).",

Environmental stress is implemented in the form of photooxidative stress, which is thought to be a primary trigger of coral bleaching ( Lesser, 1997; Weis, 2008; Wooldridge, 2009 ) . To simulate bleaching, we model the absorption and quenching of light energy by photochemistry and non-photochemical quenching, and the responses that occur (i.e., photoinhibition, photodamage, and symbiont loss) when these quenching capacities are overwhelmed. While bleaching in response to high light alone has been observed experimentally ( Downs et al., 2013; Schutter et al., 2011 ) , mass coral bleaching events occur concurrently with high temperature ( Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999 ) . Thus, it is important to justify our consideration of light as the primary stressor. In reality, light and temperature interact synergistically ( Coles and Jokiel, 1978; Jones et al., 1998 ) , and in fact, any stressor that disrupts the quenching of light energy may lead to bleaching Wooldridge, 2010 ) . This is because the proximate cause of photo-oxidative stress is excess excitation energy, but the upstream events that lead to this situation may be diverse. Indeed, elevated temperature may inhibit Rubisco functioning ( Jones et al., 1998 ) and the repair of the D1 protein in photosystem II ( Warner et al., 1999 ) , which reduces the capacity of photochemical quenching and leads to an excess of light energy. In this way, elevated temperature serves to reduce the threshold above which light stresses the system ( Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999 ) ; importantly, light is still the proximate stressor. Therefore, we omitted temperature from the model to maintain a desired level of simplicity, while still allowing photooxidative stress and bleaching to be simulated with biological realism in response to light.",

We therefore specify j CO 2 as the host-mediated delivery of CO 2 to photosynthesis that encompasses potentially diverse CCMs, including active transport of bicarbonate, carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed conversion of bicarbonate to CO 2 to promote diffusion toward the symbiont , and acidification of the symbiosome to increase localized CO 2 concentrations around the symbiont ( Barott et al., 2014 ) . Since these active CCMs require energetic input by the host, we define j CO 2 as proportional to j eC , assuming that some of this carbon is respired to energize the CCMs. This formulation means that the symbiont indirectly ensures its own CO 2 supply by providing fixed carbon ( = energy) to the host ( Wooldridge, 2013 ) . The parameter k CO 2 scales the efficacy of host CCMs, which enables the comparison of different rates of CO 2 delivery that may characterize different coral species ( Wooldridge, 2014a ) . The active input of CO 2 to the photosynthesis SU is therefore specified as",

Several of these fluxes are defined implicitly ; for example, the rejection fluxes of carbon and nitrogen from the symbiont and host biomass SUs, respectively, act as reciprocal input fluxes to the other SU. Similarly, the photosynthesis SU receives CO 2 at a rate proportional to the carbon rejection flux from the host biomass SU, and the rejection flux of excitation energy from the photosynthesis SU acts to reduce its own production through photoinhibition. Without further assumptions, however, the dynamical system is not always unambiguously defined because for some combinations of parameters and environmental forcing functions the system of algebraic equations has more than one solution with all fluxes non-negative (see results below). In such circumstances, the right hand side of the differential equations (1) and ( 2 ) is not uniquely defined even when S and H are specified. We resolved this problem by defining the dynamical system as the limit as a time step t \u2192 0 of a discretized system corresponding to Euler integration of the differential equations, with those fluxes that represent flows of elemental matter implemented by assuming that transfer of material between components of the system takes one time step.

The mechanism that produces these alternate stable states is the positive feedback between carbon-limitation of the host and CO 2 -limitation of photosynthesis: if symbiont biomass is initially very low (i.e., a \"bleached\" coral), very little carbon is fixed, and the system cannot escape this positive feedback and cannot grow (unless feeding is sufficiently high). However, if symbiont biomass is initially high (i.e., a \"healthy\" coral), then the system remains in a nitrogen-limited state with positive growth. For practical purposes, this section of the manuscript considers only positive growth steady states under constant environments; subsequently, we explore how environmental forcing may cause the system to switch between alternate stable states, which we interpret in the context of coral bleaching (see \"Coral Bleaching and Recovery\", below).",

(2009) , and has also been observed experimentally ( Muller-Parker et al., 1994; Tanaka et al., 2013 Tanaka et al., , 2007 . However, DIN elevation beyond a certain point (e.g., \u223c 3-4 \u03bcM in these simulations) has little effect on growth as carbon becomes limiting. Although very high nutrient levels may reduce growth in nature ( Shantz et al., 2015 ) , these impacts are not likely to occur within the range of concentrations considered here ( < 4 \u03bcM) ( Ferrier-Pag\u00e9s et al., 20 0 0 ). In addition to increasing growth, DIN also increases the symbiont to host biomass ratio ( Fig. 3 (B) ), a phenomenon also observed in reef corals ( Marubini and Davies, 1996 ) . At low DIN and intermediate light, more typical of coral reef environments, symbiont to host biomass ratios are around \u223c 0.06-0.21, which is consistent with values reported in the literature ( Edmunds et al., 2011; Hawkins et al., 2016; Muscatine et al., 1981 ) .",

(2007) in Acropora pulchra under similar N-enriched conditions. Under conditions more typical of reef environments ( < 0.5 \u03bcM DIN), predicted growth rates are \u223c 0.01-0.03 d \u22121 . Observed specific growth rates in several coral species fall near or below the lower end of this range ( \u223c 0.01 d \u22121 ) , though values as high as 0.025 d \u22121 have been reported in Galaxea fascicularis ( Schutter et al., 2010 ) , and 0.04 d \u22121 in Aiptasia diaphana , a non-calcifying symbiotic anemone Fig. 5 . Light-driven seasonal dynamics of symbiont abundance and coral growth. Light input (upper panel) was designed as a sinusoidal curve with a period of one year, with maximum and minimum values of 44 and 20 mol photons m \u22122 d \u22121 , corresponding to those measured by Stimson (1997) . The dynamic behavior of symbiont to host biomass ratio (middle panel) and the specific growth rate of host biomass (lower panel) show seasonal oscillations that are greater in magnitude under high nutrients (15.14 \u03bcM N; dashed lines) relative to low nutrients (0.14 \u03bcM N; solid lines), consistent with the findings of Stimson (1997) . Prey density was set at 1e \u22126 CmolX L \u22121 . ( Armoza-Zvuloni et al., 2014 ) . However, it is not surprising that observed growth rates are often lower than model predictions, since the model does not account for ecological factors that may limit growth (e.g., competition, predation, bioerosion). Furthermore, while most measurements are made on skeletal growth, the model predicts biomass growth, which may not always be strongly correlated ( Anthony, 2002 ) .",

The mechanism underlying this decline is the increase in light energy beyond the capacities of photosynthesis and non-photochemical quenching: excess excitation energy generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Roth, 2014; Weis, 2008 ) , which, in this model, have the phenomenological consequences of reducing the photosynthetic rate (representing photoinhibition) and increasing symbiont biomass loss (representing photodamage and/or symbiont expulsion) (see Eynaud et al., 2011 ) . Together, these impacts reduce the symbiont to host biomass ratio ( Fig. 3 (B) ), as occurs during coral bleaching. This reduction in symbionts consequently reduces the flux of fixed carbon to the host, resulting in increasing carbon-limitation and eventual cessation of growth ( Fig. 3 (A) ).",

This gradual decline is consistent with experimental results showing that high light levels decrease growth , and field studies documenting optimum growth rates at intermediate depths ( Baker and Weber, 1975; Huston and Discovery, 1985 ) . By incorporating these impacts of light stress, the model predicts greater, and more realistic, variation in state variables across light gradients than was predicted by the models of Muller et al. (2009) , which did not include photoinhibition or photodamage, or Eynaud et al. (2011) , which included representations of photoinhibition or photodamage separately. It is important to recognize that the upper light limit set by photooxidative stress on a stable symbiosis under steady state conditions ( Fig. 3 ) may be temporarily crossed by a dynamic system, which may experience a period of symbiont loss (bleaching) and reduced growth, after which a return to benign conditions may restore symbiont biomass and positive growth. To explore this further and illustrate the behavior of the model in more detail, we evaluate a number of dynamic simulations below (see \"Dynamic behavior\").",

The role of light in driving seasonal changes in symbiont density was demonstrated nicely by Stimson (1997) , who also found that experimental nutrient-enrichment amplified the light-driven seasonal oscillation. Using the levels of light and nutrients from this study as inputs, the model reproduces this observed interaction among environmental factors ( Fig. 5 ) , and also provides the mechanism: increasing light in summer decreases symbiont growth rates due Fig. 6 . Coral bleaching as a switch from a nitrogen-to carbon-limited alternative stable state. This transition is demonstrated in response to gradually increasing external light (A), which causes an increase in production of ROS (B) that reduces the photosynthetic rate through photoinhibition (C). Decreasing photosynthesis moves the system from overall nitrogen-limitation toward carbon-limitation (D); when this threshold is crossed, the system rapidly becomes highly carbon-limited as photosynthesis becomes CO 2 -limited (E) and symbiont densities rapidly decline (F) into a bleached state. Substrate limitation coefficients were calculated using Eq. (23) . All parameters were set at default values with external DIN = 1e \u22127 mol N/L and prey density set to zero. Fig. 7 .

Points are colored according to whether the host exhibits positive (black) or negative (red) growth at steady state. Arrows above points indicate values beyond the y -axis range. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Seasonal changes in nutrients associated with fertilization use and runoff during growing seasons may also impact these dynamics. Thus, the relative magnitude of fluctuation in temperature, light, and nutrients may produce wide variability in the direction and magnitude of seasonal changes in growth and symbiont abundance, depending on location and microhabitat. Nevertheless, the seasonal variability predicted here in response to light ( Fig. 5 ) is consistent with experimental and field observations for corals, and demonstrates the model's ability to predict dynamic behavior that mechanistically integrates multiple environmental drivers.",

As symbionts are expelled, the host receives less fixed carbon, which may then compromise its ability to activate CCMs that deliver CO 2 to photosynthesis ( Wooldridge, 2013 ) . Increasing CO 2 -limitation for remaining symbionts, along with an amplified internal light environment due to reduced selfshading ( Enr\u00edquez et al., 2005 ) , may further exacerbate photooxida-tive stress and accelerate symbiont expulsion, driving the coral into a bleached state.",

Interestingly, these feedbacks lead to alternate stable states in the symbiotic system. The 'healthy' state is characterized by nitrogen-limitation of both symbiont and host: under these conditions, the symbiont translocates sufficient carbon to support host growth and CCMs, which ensures that photosynthesis does not become CO 2 -limited. However, if carbon translocation is disrupted (and light is sufficiently high), then the system is driven into the 'bleached' state by photooxidative stress and positively reinforcing carbon-and CO 2limitation. In this context, coral bleaching can be understood as a transition from one stable state to another, and bleaching thresholds are sets of environmental conditions that push a healthy-state coral onto a trajectory leading to a bleached state.",

Most straightforwardly, this switch occurs when increasing external irradiance ( Fig. 6 (A) ) causes sufficient ROS production ( Fig. 6 (B) ) and photoinhibition ( Fig. 6 (C) ) that the positive feedbacks between host carbon-limitation ( Fig. 6 (D) ) and CO 2 -limitation of photosynthesis ( Fig. 6 (E) ) are rapidly engaged, leading to even greater photooxidative stress and a rapid decline in S:H biomass ( Fig. 6 (F) ), characteristic of coral bleaching. However, the positive feedbacks involved in bleaching are not engaged only in response to high external irradiance alone; in fact, they depend on the relative balance of light energy absorption and quenching, which in turn depends on the availability of CO 2 for photosynthesis. While previous models framed photooxidative stress as a fixed response to absolute external irradiance ( Eynaud et al., 2011 ) , our implementation considers the dynamic balance of multiple energy sinks in the causation of stress, which is more consistent with current understanding of symbiosis dysfunction ( Wooldridge, 2013 ) , and establishes a critical role of host CCMs in providing CO 2 for photosynthesis Tansik et al., 2015 ) .",

For example, simulations of high light stress ( Fig. 7 ) demonstrate that bleaching can be attenuated by heterotrophic feeding, a phenomenon which has been observed experimentally ( Borell et al., 2008 ) . The mechanism underlying this prediction is that feeding by the host increases host CCM activity, which delays the onset of CO 2 -limitation of photosynthesis and reduces bleaching severity. On the other hand, elevated nutrients exacerbate bleaching ( Fig. 7 ) , since higher symbiont densities are more susceptible to CO 2 -limitation ( Wooldridge, 2009 ) . Several experimental ( Cunning and Baker, 2013; Thurber et al., 2014; Wiedenmann et al., 2013 ) and correlational studies ( Wooldridge and Done, 2009 ) are consistent with this mechanistic link between high nutrients and bleaching.",

In natural settings, this typically occurs through seasonal declines in temperature and light. However, hysteresis associated with the system's alternate stable states indicates that the symbiosis cannot recover along the same trajectory it followed during bleaching; indeed, the stressor must be alleviated below the threshold that initially caused bleaching in order for the system to recover ( Fig. 2 ) . This is because under the same external conditions, a bleached coral with low S:H biomass (relative to a healthy coral with high S:H biomass) is char-acterized by greater light amplification and weaker CCM activity, which enhance photooxidative stress and serve to maintain the carbon-limited state. In order for the system to recover, the stressor must be reduced enough such that photooxidative stress ceases and translocation of carbon from symbiont to host is resumed. Once this occurs, the host can energize its CCMs, which further enhances carbon fixation and accelerates the system back toward a nitrogen-limited state, indicative of recovery. The conditions under which recovery can occur -which determine the magnitude of hysteresis ( Fig. ) depend on the relative abundance of nitrogen and carbon in the environment. Higher food levels, representing a non-autotrophic carbon source for the host, make it easier for the host to overcome carbon-limitation ( Fig. 8 (A) and (D)), thus providing a potential mechanism underlying observations that feeding aids recovery from bleaching ( Connolly et al., 2012; Grottoli et al., ) . Conversely, high external DIN impedes the re-establishment of nitrogen-limitation, making recovery from bleaching more difficult (i.e., narrowing -or eliminating -conditions under which recovery is possible, Fig. 8 (C) ).",

In fact, unusually high symbiont densities have been observed following bleaching in both experimental and field studies ( Kemp et al., 2014 ) , and have been interpreted as a potential 'disequilibrium in host-symbiont regulation' ( Kemp et al., 2014 ) . The model reveals the dynamics of this 'overshoot' as follows: as symbionts repopulate the host, photosynthesis becomes increasingly CO 2 -limited due to weak CCM activity of the carbon-limited host. Thus, although symbiont growth is not yet carbon-limited, a growing symbiont population has less and less excess carbon (per symbiont) to share, and is thus moving toward carbon-limitation. Meanwhile, because S:H biomass is increasing, the host receives more and more carbon per unit host biomass, and is thus moving away from carbon-limitation. If the host overcomes carbon-limitation before the symbiont reaches it, then the system rapidly transitions to the nitrogen-limited state and the S:H ratio stabilizes without an overshoot ( Fig. (A) ). However, if the symbiont becomes carbon-limited first ( Fig. 9 (B) and (C)), then carbon translocation per symbiont declines further and photosynthesis becomes more CO 2 -limited, which maintains carbon-limitation of the host. In this situation, continued growth of less and less productive symbionts drives S:H biomass to a much higher level before the host finally overcomes carbon-limitation. At this point, representing the peak of the overshoot, the transition to nitrogenlimitation finally takes place and the S:H biomass ratio declines and stabilizes as positive growth is resumed.",

On the other hand, factors that favor nitrogen-limitation, such as low external DIN and/or high feeding rates, will accelerate the re-establishment of nitrogen-limitation and prevent an overshoot from occurring at all. While many scenarios are possible under different environmental conditions, we illustrate the general effects of varying N and C availability on recovery from bleaching with a series of simulations that vary the N:C ratio of host's heterotrophic food source ( Fig. 9 (A) -(C)): lower N:C ratios (effectively representing lower DIN and/or higher heterotrophy) favor nitrogenlimitation and more rapid recovery, while higher N:C ratios (effectively representing higher DIN and/or lower heterotrophy) favor carbon-limitation and prolonged recovery with a larger overshoot in S:H biomass. Higher N:C ratios in a heterotrophic food source (effectively representing higher external DIN and/or lower feeding rates) cause a larger overshoot in the S:H biomass ratio, and prolong the duration of time until the system 'recovers' by re-establishing nitrogen-limitation. Substrate limitation coefficients were calculated using Eq. (23) . All simulations were run with default parameters (except varying n NX ), with L = 20 mol photons m 2 d \u22121 , DIN = 1e \u22127 mol N k L \u22121 , prey = 1e \u22127 CmolX L \u22121 , and initial S:H biomass = 0.001.",

A high S:H biomass ratio alone does not necessarily indicate that a 'healthy' state has been reached, since the carbon-limited state may still persist (e.g. Fig. 9 (B) and (C)). This could explain why corals that have recovered their symbiont populations after bleaching may still exhibit energetic deficits and physiological impacts, possibly for months to years ( Hughes and Grottoli, 2013; Levitan et al., 2014 ) . These findings suggest that host acquisition of carbon from a source other than the symbiont may be extremely important for the system to recover from bleaching. Indeed, host feeding has been shown to promote a more rapid return to pre-bleaching levels of key physiological parameters in recovering corals ( Connolly et al., 2012 ) . Additional carbon sources for the host, such as direct uptake of dissolved organic carbon ( Levas et al., 2015 ) , may also promote more rapid recovery from a bleached state.",

Moreover, the model reproduces complex dynamic behaviors including seasonal changes in symbiont density at different nutrient levels, rapid bleaching above a threshold of high light, mitigation of bleaching by heterotrophic feeding, exacerbation of bleaching by elevated nutrients, and an overshoot of symbiont density during recovery from bleaching. These examples demonstrate the model's ability to integrate multiple environmental forcing functions to reproduce complex responses; meanwhile, the diversity of these phenomena suggest the model has captured many of the important features of the system in a unifying mechanistic framework. This model also provides a new conceptual framework for considering coral bleach-ing as a transition to an alternate stable state, which has important implications for understanding the performance and maintenance of symbiotic interactions. In this context, the 'healthy' stable state represents a scenario in which nitrogen-limitation stabilizes the symbiont to host biomass ratio and maintains positive growth. Conversely, carbon-limitation represents a dysfunctional state wherein positive feedbacks result in coral bleaching and negative growth, with hysteresis maintaining this alternate state until a favorable environment is re-established. Interestingly, alternate stable states have received much attention in coral reef community ecology with respect to coral-and macroalgal-dominance on reefs ( Mumby et al., 2007 ) . Here, we find that the same principles may also mediate bleaching and recovery in individual corals.",

Thus, the diversity of potential applications for this model is high, and we envision this work as a foundation for continued development, which may include more detailed treatments of specific modules (e.g., DIC processing), and the incorporation of more external forcing capabilities (e.g., external DIC, temperature). Importantly, open source R code allows this effort to benefit from contributions from the wider scientific community, including those with empirical and theoretical backgrounds. Ultimately, the continued refinement of these tools is fundamental in elucidating the mechanisms of symbiosis function and dysfunction, and in predicting coral responses to environmental change.",

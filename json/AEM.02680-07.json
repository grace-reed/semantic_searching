However, little research attention has been paid to these diseases, mostly because viruses are considered the most significant diseases in crustacean aquaculture (22) . As a result, solutions to control vibriosis remain scarce. The massive use of antibiotics is certainly not a sustainable control strategy, since it favors the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains (17) . Moreover, antibiotics are often banned from aquaculture ponds for commercial reasons and because of the increasing concern about residue issues. Additionally, vaccination is not possible in invertebrates, limiting the ways to reduce disease impact in shrimp culture (2) . Therefore, there is a need to understand the environmental, physiological, and bacterial conditions leading to the expression of the disease in order to determine ecological or zootechnical methods that could in the end control these diseases (16) . One step consists of diagnosing and quantifying the etiologic agent of the disease, both in the cultivated animal and in its environment.",

A multidisciplinary research program aiming at a global understanding of this disease was set up, bringing together rearing technology, pond ecosystem studies, shrimp physiology and immunology, nutrition and genetics, pathology, and bacteriology approaches (11) . Epidemiological studies have revealed that this disease is a vibriosis due to HP Vibrio nigripulchritudo isolates (7, 8) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported disease associated with this Vibrio species. Because the New Caledonian shrimp production is also affected by another vibriosis, namely, syndrome 93, occurring during the cool season (6), the spreading of the summer syndrome to other shrimp farms would undoubtedly threaten the sustainable development of the New Caledonian shrimp industry. Preliminary studies based on a collection of V. nigripulchritudo isolates have brought to light different virulence levels, according to experimental-infection results (7) . The genetic structures of 58 selected V. nigripulchritudo isolates were studied using arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) (8) . These two typing methods gave congruent results, revealing a clustering of HP and moderately pathogenic isolates (MP). None of the nonpathogenic (NP) isolates was present in this cluster. The hypothesis that this particular cluster of pathogenic V. nigripulchritudo isolates emerged within a shrimp farm environment has been pro-posed. This emergence could be linked to the recent acquisition of one or several genetic elements, leading a moderately virulent isolate to become HP.",

In a second step, the distribution of the screened SSH fragments was studied in a selection of both virulent (either HP or MP) and NP V. nigripulchritudo isolates by macroarray. This allowed us to determine more precisely which DNA fragments were constantly associated with virulence and could possibly be part of the virulence determinants. Lastly, the discovery of a replicon detected only in HP V. nigripulchritudo isolates led to a discussion of the role of mobile genetic elements in the emergence of pathogenicity in V. nigripulchritudo.",

The genetic diversity of Vibrio, as well as the complexity of virulence mechanisms, causes difficulties in diagnosing vibriosis. Among the approaches that can be proposed to investigate genetic markers of pathogenicity, whole-genome sequencing appears to be the most informative, as it has significantly improved our understanding of the physiology and pathogenicity of many microbes and has provided insights into the mechanisms and history of genome evolution (5) . The genomes of four Vibrio species have already been sequenced: V. cholerae (12) , V. parahaemolyticus (23) , V. vulnificus (3), and V. fischeri (29) . This makes comparative genomics an attractive approach to investigate the basis of virulence in Vibrio. However, in spite of recent progress in high-density sequencing methods, this approach is still laborious and expensive, and as a consequence, it is restricted to a limited number of strains. Furthermore, if whole-genome sequencing allows us to rapidly and extensively hypothesize virulence mechanisms based on putative virulence determinants deduced from known functions of heterologous or orthologous known sequences, the functional demonstration of their involvement in virulence still relies on mutagenesis and complementation of the candidate genes.",

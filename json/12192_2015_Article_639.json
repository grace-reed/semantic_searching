This pollutant is an environmental stressor due to its toxicity, persistence, and accumulation in biota and it is widespread in the aquatic environment (Waisberg et al. 2003; Chora et al. 2009) . Cd is present at low concentrations in open seawater, while in coastal and estuarine areas, its concentration may increase even more than twenty times (Pigeot et al. 2006) . In some cases, this toxicant can induce both apoptosis and autophagy (Dong et al. 2009; Templeton and Liu 2010) . Cd toxic effects have been well documented, especially in molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and fishes (Roccheri and Matranga 2010) .",

One of the most sensitive organs for lysosomal detection is the digestive gland, or hepatopancreas, of bivalve shellfish such as the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. The lysosomal system plays a central and crucial role in cellular food degradation (intracellular digestion), toxic response, and internal turnover (autophagy) of the digestive cells (McVeigh et al. 2006) .",

Digestive cells showed well-characterized reactions in response to the exposure to lipophilic xenobiotics, such as oilderived aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs), which accumulate in these cells with minimal biotransformation. It was developed a simulation model, based on processes associated with the flux of carbon through these cells, including the following physiological parameters: fluctuating food concentration, cell volume, respiration, secretion/excretion, storage of glycogen and lipids, protein/ organelle turnover (autophagy/resynthesis), and carbon export to other mussel tissues. The major response to AHs was the induction of autophagy in these cells. The simulations indicated that the reactions to AHs and food deprivation represent a good model for the in vivo measured responses (Moore and Allen 2002; Moore 2002; Allen and McVeigh 2004) . On the basis of a hypothesis formulated by Moore, the autophagic removal of oxidatively damaged organelles and proteins provides a second tier of defense against oxidative stress (Moore et al. 2006a) . It has been further hypothesized that repeated triggering of autophagy can protectively minimize the generation of lipofuscin, a product of the oxidative attack on proteins and lipids that can accumulate in lysosomes, where it can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit the lysosomal function, resulting in autophagic failure. Consequently, animals living in fluctuating environments, in which autophagy is repeatedly stimulated by natural stressors, seem to be generically more tolerant to pollutant stress. Therefore, the authors speculate that organisms making up functional ecological assemblages in fluctuating environments, where upregulation of autophagy should provide a selective advantage, may be preselected to be tolerant of pollutantinduced oxidative stress (Moore et al. 2006a (Moore et al. , b, c, 2007 (Moore et al. , 2008 .",

Several events indicated progressive cell death: increased phagocytosis by granulocytes, autophagy, and apoptosis in epithelial cells of gills and in primary and secondary digestive tubules epithelial cells.

An overall decrease of protein spots was detected in both treated tissues, being higher in gill. Some of the spots more drastically altered after pollutants exposure were excised and nine were identified, including three proteins upregulated, one downregulated, four suppressed, and one induced. In particular, Cd induces major changes in proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure maintenance, cell maintenance, and metabolism, suggesting potential energetic change. An overall decrease of protein spots was detected in both treated tissues. Lysosomal autophagy could explain this decrease since it is considered a survival strategy.

This process, primarily caused by the increased temperatures of seawater, is characterized by the loss of symbiotic algae, their pigments, or both, and it is a major contributor to the global decline of coral reefs. The ecological and socioeconomic implications of bleaching are immense (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007) . Autophagy, one of the mechanisms involved in the bleaching process, has been identified using specific autophagic markers (Rab7, a key GTPase to lysosome biogenesis, and LAS, a lysosomal acid phosphatase). Results showed that during light and temperature stress, the symbiont vacuolar membrane is transformed from a conduit of nutrient exchange to a digestive organelle, resulting in the consumption of the symbiont, a process termed symbiophagy by the authors. It has been hypothesized that, during a stress event, the mechanism maintaining symbiosis is destabilized and symbiophagy is activated, ultimately resulting in the phenomenon of bleaching. This work was focused on the Symbiodinium cell as the initiator of the bleaching cascade (Downs et al. 2009) .",

Several studies indicate that autophagy plays a key role in controlling muscle mass by protein degradation (Mommsen 2004; Salem et al. 2006; Seiliez et al. 2012) . Most components of autophagy and its associated signaling pathways (AKT1, TOR, AMPK, FOXO) are evolutionarily conserved in the rainbow trout (Polakof et al. 2011; Seiliez et al. 2008; Seiliez et al. 2012) . Using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, Seiliez and colleagues were able to demonstrate that fasting fish or serum depletion of trout myocytes strongly induces the expression of several major genes involved in autophagy (LC3B, gabarapl1, atg12l, atg4b), suggesting that autophagy is acting as a cell survival mechanism to provide the energy and the nutrients essential for allowing fish to survive during nutritional starvation (Seiliez et al. 2010) . More recent results demonstrated that rainbow trout myoblasts can trigger the activation of both short-and long-term autophagy-lysosomal degradative programs during nutritional starvation: the first is a rapid and transient transcription-independent induction, while the second is a slower mechanism requiring gene expression (Seiliez et al. 2012) .",

One of these is the transparency of the embryo, thanks to which autophagosome formation can be observed by the use of transgenic GFP-LC3. This method was used to study the induction of autophagy in cultured zebrafish cells under starvation conditions. Subcellular localization of endogenous MAP1-LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1-light chain 3B) protein in zebrafish embryonic cells was examined by ultracentrifugal fractionation and Western blot analysis, and the results indicated that MAP1-LC3B translocates from the cytosol to membranes, including lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, during amino acid starvation. The induction of the autophagy-lysosome pathway during starvation was also confirmed by Western blot analysis, showing the conversion of endogenous MAP1-LC3B-I to MAP1-LC3B-II in the skeletal muscle and hepatopancreas (Yabu et al. 2012) .",

Using a cell line derived from the tailfin of the marine teleost yellowtail fish Seriola quinqueradiata, Yabu and colleagues showed that CMA was induced in heat-shocked cells, suggesting that chaperonemediated autophagic protein degradation may play a key role in stimulating catabolism in heat-shocked fish cells. Furthermore, using wortmannin, which acts as a PI3 protein kinase inhibitor against other autophagic signaling pathway via IGF-1 and TOR kinase, the authors were able to show that macroautophagy, as well as CMA, were enhanced in fish cells under stress conditions (Yabu et al. 2011) .",

Recently, some genes involved in the regulation of autophagy were identified in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (KEGG PATHWAY: spu04140). Even if there is now a large number of model systems used to study autophagy, P. lividus sea urchin embryo still represents one of the most suitable systems for both in vivo and in vitro analysis (Klionsky et al. 2012) . The advantages of studying the induction of autophagy in this model system (or other defense strategies) under stress conditions depend on the possibility of adding many chemicals to the media (filtered sea water) that will subsequently be directly absorbed through the membrane of embryo cells (Chiarelli and Roccheri 2012) . Another advantage is the possibility to detect LC3A/B by means of both protein gel blot and immunofluorescence in situ analysis. Furthermore, in vivo staining of autolysosomes with acidotropic dyes can also be performed. Studies on whole embryos provide qualitative and quantitative data about autophagy induction and about the spatial localization of autophagic markers in the cells. It is worthy to note that the application of the techniques on whole organisms gives the remarkable opportunity to investigate the autophagic phenomenon in multipotent cells interacting among themselves in their natural localization and environment, bypassing the disadvantages of studying isolated cells that are deprived of their normal network of interactions (Klionsky et al. 2012) .",

In contrast, if the Cd insult is much higher (i.e., 1 mM lasting 24 h), the killed cells are more numerous and, after the Cd removal, the normal development cannot be restored (Roccheri et al. 2004; Agnello et al. 2007) .

Taken together, these data lead to the conclusion that the first response to the Cd insult is the induction of HSPs and metallothioneins. Subsequently, the embryo activates the autophagic process as a cell survival mechanism; finally, if the damage is too extensive, the apoptotic program is massively activated leading to the death of the embryo.

According to the first hypothesis, we suggested that the temporal choice of the two mechanisms depends on the fact that the embryo tries to face the stress conditions using, initially, a defense strategy that is less deleterious, i.e., autophagy, to preserve the developmental program. If this process is not sufficient to offset the damage caused by a continuous stress, the mechanism of apoptosis is activated, probably as a last attempt to save the embryo by removing only some few damaged cells. If the insult persists, the whole embryo dies. In this case, second hypothesis, autophagy could provide the energy necessary for apoptosis through the supply of ATP molecules, by recycling of damaged cellular components. According to the third hypothesis, since the sea urchin embryo does not have specialized phagocytes, it could begin the clearance of apoptotic bodies through autophagy (Chiarelli et al. 2011) .",

In these conditions, apoptosis was not detected and the embryos degenerated. In parallel, we carried out the same assay providing an energetic substrate, the methyl pyruvate (MP). The results demonstrated that autophagy temporally anticipates the massive apoptotic response and the inhibition of autophagy produces a concomitant reduction of apoptosis . The administration of MP restored the apoptotic signals, suggesting that the energetic hypothesis could be probable. Indeed, autophagy may operate to supply energy through the recycling of damaged cellular components, necessary to sustain the ATP-dependent apoptotic pathway, essential for the clearance of dying cells (Fig. 2) . This would justify the temporal relationship between autophagy and apoptosis.",

In both invertebrate and vertebrate taxa, autophagy operates as a protective mechanism, playing a crucial role in the response to stress, sometimes in concert with the apoptotic machinery.

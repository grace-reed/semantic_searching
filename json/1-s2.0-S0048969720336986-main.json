The definition of ocean acidification (OA) was firstly proposed by Caldeira and Wickett in 2003 , which demonstrated that the absorption of CO might lower the pH value of the ocean and alter the seawater carbonate system (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003) . Recently, a decrease of 0.1 units ocean pH value has been observed and the value would be 0.3-0.4 at the end of this century (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007) . In 2300, a pH reduction of 0.7 units is estimated to be caused by the continued release of CO 2 , and the speed of pH reduction will exceed any experienced in the past 300 million years (H\u00f6nisch et al., 2012) . OA is a new global environmental problem associated with global warming, which might impose tremendous impact on the marine ecosystem and marine organisms.",

                "text": "A number of recent studies have confirmed the adverse effects of OA on marine organisms, especially marine calcifiers, such as marine bivalves (Fabry, 2008; Ridgwell and Schmidt, 2010; Pan et al., 2015; Leung et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019) . With the vital roles in marine and terrestrial ecosystems and major effects on humans mainly as food sources, many bivalves have been used as models to study the physiological response and adaptation mechanisms to OA. Most of the studies focused on collecting the negative effects of OA on calcification, growth, development, energy metabolism, acid-base regulation, immunological response and behaviors (Gazeau et al., 2013; Gobler and Talmage, 2013; Navarro et al., 2013; Parker et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016) . The knowledge of the physiological mechanisms underlying these effects is important to understand the vulnerability of marine calcifiers to OA (Hofmann et al., 2008; Todgham and Hofmann, 2009; Li et al., 2016a) . At molecular level and cellular level, the involved genes and signal transduction pathways are the key drivers that determine whether these marine organisms could adapt to OA or compensate the deleterious impacts (Dineshram et al., 2015) . It is fundamental to identify these genes and characterize the pathways to understand the mechanism involved in the physiological response and adaptation of marine bivalves to OA. Previous mantle tissue transcriptome analysis demonstrated that energy, protein metabolism and shell matrix related genes (F-ATPase, hexokinase, elongation factor alpha, chitinase and tyrosinase) might contribute to the acclimation to elevated seawater pCO (H\u00fcning et al., 2012) . In juvenile corals, it was found that the up-regulation of heat shock protein and Bcl-2 genes mediated the acclimation (Moya et al., 2015) . The results provide valuable information for the further investigation about the molecular basis of physiological response to ocean acidification.",

                "text": "The direct effects of OA are not only the decline of seawater pH value but also the alternation of chemistry of the seawater-carbonate system, such as dissolved inorganic carbon (the sum of the solution concentrations of CO , H 2 CO 3 , HCO \u2212 , CO 3 2\u2212 ) and saturation state of aragonite and calcite (Feely et al., 2004; Orr et al., 2005; Feely et al., 2012) . These changes would further affect the physiological status of marine organisms, such as the increase of calcium concentration in hemolymph partially from CaCO 3 shell dissolution for bivalves. The intracellular HCO 3 \u2212 and Ca 2+ of Patella vulgate increased significantly after shortterm exposure to elevated CO 2 (pH 8.2 and pH 7.6) (Marchant et al., 2010) . While the intracellular Ca 2+ in C. gigas was significantly lower than that in the control group after 7-day CO 2 exposure treatment at pH 7.5 (Wang et al., 2017a) . Intracellular calcium not only serves as a participant in various biological activities like metabolism regulation, biomineralization but a ubiquitous second messenger to regulate signal transduction within or between cells (Clapham, 2007; Zheng et al., 2015) . The changes of intracellular calcium to a number of stimuli and its involvement in signal transduction during stresses acclimation have been widely investigated and illustrated in plants (Yang et al., 2009; Cheval et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015) . While the changes of intracellular calcium and the regulation mechanisms of calcium signal in marine animals in response to OA remain largely unknown. There are a series of reports about the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or proteins related to calcium homeostasis, ion transport, signal transduction, and calcification process. For example, calcium transport ATPase (SERCA), calmodulin (CaM), calmodulin-like protein (CaML), calreticulin (CRT) and sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX) were found to be up-regulated after OA exposure, which led to the decrease of free calcium content in mantle cells of pearl oyster Pinctada fucata and further influenced biomineralization (Li et al., 2016a) . The upregulation of calcium-binding proteins (CBPs) such as calmodulin and cadherin was also reported in oyster larvae in response to OA at pH 7.6 (Dineshram et al., 2015) . These results demonstrated that various calcium signal pathways might jointly coordinate the responses to OA in marine organisms. Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is one of the most widely cultured species in the second largest animal phylum Mollusca (Kocot et al., 2011) and also an important marine calcifier and ecosystem engineer in the marine environment. Oysters are regarded as model organisms for biomonitoring and investigation of marine environmental stress. In the past decades, the large fluctuations in seawater pH along the coast imposed great threaten on the aquaculture of oyster and the maintenance of oyster reef ecosystem. Although negative effects of OA on the physiological responses of marine calcifers, including Pacific oyster, have been widely demonstrated, it remains largely unknown how Pacific oyster can adapt or acclimate to OA. It is of critical importance to explore the possible living strategy of Pacific oyster under OA. The recently released genome sequences of C. gigas (Zhang et al., 2012) provided solid support for transcriptome-wide analyses of the molecular mechanism in response to OA. In the present study, short-term (7 days) and long-term (60 days) seawater acidification were conducted with the objectives to examine the transcriptional changes of C. gigas under seawater acidification and reveal the potential molecular mechanisms of the physiological responses to OA in marine bivalves.",

After oyster C. gigas was exposed to the elevated CO 2, significant enrichments of membrane (GO:0016020) and binding (GO:0005488) were observed, which were the most abundant categories in both the SVB and LVB groups (Fig. 1) . This finding suggested that the enhanced activities involved in the membrane, binding such as ion exchange, acid-base regulation emerged as the principal transcriptome responses of adult C. gigas to CO 2 stress. The result was conformed to the previous reports that the genes related to ion-transport were up-regulated in coral (Vidal-Dupiol et al., 2013) , pearl oyster (Li et al., 2016a) , and sea urchin (Evans et al., 2013) . The regulation of these genes was also correlated with physiological changes after short-and long-term CO 2 exposure. For example, intracellular HCO 3 \u2212 and Ca 2+ in limpet (Patella vulgata) increased (Marchant et al., 2010) after 5-day CO 2 exposure.

                "text": "In the present study, the variations of the intracellular calcium concentration and extracellular calcium content (calcium content in serum) were observed, which could also support these transcriptional changes. It has been documented that the active energy metabolism of marine and estuarine mollusks is always accompanied with ion transportation (Lannig et al., 2010; Ivanina et al., 2013; Moya et al., 2016) . A set of significantly differently expressed genes were enriched in the category heterocyclic compound binding (GO:1901363) in both the SVB and LVB gene lists (Tables 2, S5 ). The GO annotation of these DEGs indicated that they were mainly involved in ATP or GTP binding, implying the metabolic regulation under CO 2 exposure. It was previously reported that ATP content in the gill tissue of Pacific oyster increased significantly after two-week CO 2 exposure (pH 7.5), which could support this hypothesis (Wang et al., 2017b) . For other bivalve mollusks exposed to the elevated CO , there were also increases in standard metabolic rate which would increase the ATP levels (Parker et al., 2013) . Under long-term exposure to OA, metabolic depression was observed in pearl oyster, which was considered to mitigate the effects of seawater acidification (Li et al., 2016a) . The present transcriptome data illustrated that the responses of C. gigas to short-and long-term CO exposure shared common mechanisms in metabolism, membrane-associated transportation, and binding processes. Despite the common mechanisms, it should be noticed that the number of DEGs in LVB group (2728) was much higher than that in SVB group (501). The GO enrichment analysis showed that there were more enriched GO terms assigned to behavior, biological adhesion, cellular component organization or biogenesis, development process, growth, locomotion, reproduction, reproductive process and rhythmic process for the up-regulated genes, and immune system for the downregulated genes in the LVB group (Fig. 1) . Similarly, more differentially expressed unigenes were also identified from oyster (Pinctada fucata) mantle tissue after 60-day CO exposure than 72-h CO 2 exposure (Li et al., 2016a; Li et al., 2016b) . The results suggested that short-term CO 2 exposure might induce physiological changes but not the mRNA expression levels of most transporters, while long-term CO exposure could stimulate the transcription of transporter mRNA to facilitate the adaptation of oyster to increased CO level. The enhanced transcription regulation might be supported by the differently expressed genes in the LVB group, which were assigned into heterocyclic compound binding category (GO:1901363) (Table S5 ). More DEGs related to DNA or RNA binding were differentially expressed in the LVB group, such as DNA polymerase III PolC-type, Musashi family of RNA-binding proteins, zinc finger protein, transcription factors and etc. DNA polymerase III PolCtype was found to be involved in multiple enzymatic pathways, including DNA replication, homologous recombination and mismatch repair (Sarangi et al., 2015) . The up-regulation of these genes indicated that long-term CO 2 exposure was associated with changes of DNA replication process. The Musashi family of RNA-binding proteins has been shown to control translation and regulate multiple stem cell populations (Sutherland et al., 2013) . It was found that the percentages of large hyalinocytes and granulocytes in pearl oyster (Pinctada fucata) increased after CO exposure (Ellis et al., 2015) . These results suggested that the increased expression of RNA-binding protein Musashi-like protein Rbp6 might contribute to the translation process and the regeneration, differentiation and maturation of hemocytes. A series of transcription regulators, such as zinc finger protein, homeobox protein caupolican, serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 1 were also upregulated, providing more evidences to the stimulated transcription process of the LVB group. Therefore, these altered replication, transcription and translation processes might provide a plausible explanation for responses of oyster to long-term CO 2 exposure.",

                "text": "Calcium ion serves as a ubiquitous second messenger and impacts nearly all aspects of life activities (Clapham, 2007) . Marine organisms must have precise regulation mechanisms to ascertain calcium homeostasis. In the present study, the extracellular calcium content (calcium content in serum) displayed an increasing trend with the CO exposure time (Fig. 3B) . This result corresponded with the previous report in marine mussels that the Ca 2+ in hemolymph increased after long-term moderate hypercapnia treatment (Michaelidis et al., 2005) . The intracellular calcium ion concentration, however, decreased significantly after short-term CO 2 exposure and then recovered to the comparable level of the blank group after long-term exposure (Fig. 3A ), suggesting that there might exist mechanism for oysters to fully compensate the changes of intracellular Ca 2+ after 60 days' CO exposure. Previous studies indicated that calcium was essential for production of ROS (Camello- Almaraz et al., 2006; Gorlach et al., 2015) , and the improved cellular calcium homeostasis could reduce ROS production in both vertebrates (Hu et al., 2017) and invertebrates like the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis (Zhang et al., 2016) . In the present study, the ROS level in oyster hemocytes and H 2 O 2 content in the serum both increased significantly after CO exposure of seven days compared to that in the blank group (p b 0.05). However, they decreased and recovered to the normal level after long-term CO 2 exposure, a change corresponding to the variation of intracellular calcium concentration. The results suggested the cross-talk between intracellular calcium and ROS level under CO exposure. Such cross-talk has been widely reported that Ca 2+ controls ROS production which in turn regulate Ca 2+ by activating Ca 2+ channels (Mazars et al., 2010) . Collectively, these results demonstrated that oysters could fully compensate the calcium and ROS variation after long-term CO 2 exposure, which might be crucial for the homeostasis and survival of the living marine animals from the sensitive environment as well as OA. The process of Ca 2+ homeostasis represents precise control and involves the engagement of a series of components of the Ca 2+ regulatory toolkit including Ca 2+ channels, Ca 2+ buffers, Ca 2+ sensors and receptors in the plasma membrane and organelles (Schwaller, 2012) . In the present study, the significantly enriched calcium binding GO term (GO:0005509) (Table S6 ) and the up-regulation of a series of CBPs were observed in the LVB group, which supported the proposal of calcium compensation in response to CO 2 exposure (Fig. 2, Table 3 ). Based on the differently expressed CBPs identified in the present study, a calcium regulatory toolkit in oyster hemocytes was further proposed to govern the calcium compensation after long-term CO exposure (Fig. 5) . The membrane associated transporters such as polycystin-2 and voltage-dependent calcium channel type D subunit alpha-1 were up-regulated significantly after 60-day CO 2 exposure to balance the calcium ion concentration among the extracellular and intracellular fluids. The similar results about the increased expression of voltage-dependent calcium channel were reported in sea urchin (Evans et al., 2013) and pearl oyster (Li et al., 2016b) under OA. A series of intracellular calcium buffers or sensors including Troponin C (Tro C), CaM and cadherin were induced after CO 2 exposure (Table 3 ). Tro C works as a medium for calcium shuttling from cytoplasm to sarcoplasmic reticulum facilitated by reported sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCB) (Y\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2012) . CaM or CaM-like proteins are major calcium-binding messenger proteins and also fast calcium buffers that participate in transcellular transport step (Perry, 1997; Porta et al., 1996) . They can bind and regulate a number of different protein targets and thereby affect different cellular processes (Clapham, 2007; Li et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014) . Cadherins can act as Ca 2+ sensors in response to the fluctuations of external Ca 2+ and participate in cell-cell adhesion and communication (Aguilar-Camacho and McCormack, 2017; Timmins-Schiffman et al., 2019) . The compensation in intracellular Ca 2 + may be mediated by release from or sequestration into organelles, mainly sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The up-regulation of two extracellular CBPs (ECBPs)-MgluRs (Table 3 ) might contribute to Ca 2+ compensation through coupling to phospholipase C (PLC), inositol (1,4,5) triphosphate receptor (IP R), which could mediate the release of Ca 2+ from ER (Takahashi et al., 1996; Perovic et al., 1999) . In the present study, a series of extracellular CBPs (ECBPs) including proteins with EGF-like domain, cadherin domain, carboxyl glutamic acidrich domain, lectin domains and EF-hand domains were also found to be significantly up-regulated in the LVB group (Table 3) . In vertebrate, ECBPs participate in modulating various cellular functions such as Ca + transport, Ca 2+ homeostasis, cell-matrix interactions, cell-cell interactions, and receptor-ligand interactions (Y\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2012) . EGF-like domain containing CBPs (EGF-CBPs) could bind Ca 2+ and induce protein-protein interactions, receptor-ligand interactions (Rao et al., 1995) . The C-type mannose receptor and macrophage mannose receptor belonging to lectin domains containing CBPs (Lec-CBPs) are important pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and participate in the activation of the innate immune system or the defense repertoire of oyster (Song et al., 2010) . As there were no obvious signs of injury or infection of oyster after long-term CO 2 exposure, it could be surmised that the increase of extracellular calcium might directly induce the upregulation of these PRRs, representing a strategy to enhance survival from OA. Taken together, it was suspected that oysters could issue compensation mechanism, such as up-regulation of genes related to replication, transcription and translation processes and calcium binding to acclimatize themselves to acidification environment, although they underwent initial disruption of calcium concentration and oxidization stress after short-term CO 2 exposure.",

The results (Fig. 4A) agreed well with the RNA-seq data, which further confirmed the increasing trend of CBP transcripts after CO 2 exposure. To investigate whether the increases of CBP transcripts were the general cellular responses to elevated serum calcium, the transcripts of these six CBPs were detected in hemocytes of the oysters exposed to EGTA and CaCl (Pinto et al., 2010) . The transcripts of all the six genes arose to significantly higher levels (p b 0.05) after CaCl exposure than that after EGTA exposure (Fig. 4B ), revealing that they were important elements of the Ca 2+ homeostasis control machinery against elevated serum calcium. In addition, increases of intracellular calcium level and ROS level were detected in both CaCl and EGTA group (Fig. S2) , confirming the interplay between calcium homeostasis and redox reaction in response to the stressed environment. It was suggested that the induction of CBPs could be an effective strategy of oysters to maintain calcium homeostasis and adaption to the increasing calcium in serum after long-term CO 2 exposure.",

                "text": "Calcium-CaM pathway plays crucial roles in cell signaling and participates in the activation of many proteins such as nitric oxide synthase, phosphodiesterases and cytoskeletal proteins (Dineshram et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016a) . The changes of CaMs at both mRNA and protein level were detected after CO exposure. The two genes including a CaM (CGI_10005633) and a CaM-like (CGI_10027355) displayed an upregulation trend after CO 2 exposure (Fig. 4C1 ), indicating CaM in oysters could be induced by seawater acidification, which was similar to those in other marine organisms (Dineshram et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016a; Cao et al., 2018) . The selected two genes displayed different expression pattern after short-and long-term CO exposure (Fig. 4C1) , in which CaM (CGI_10005633) was only significantly up-regulated in the LVB group and CaM-like (CGI_10027355) was up-regulated in both groups. Moreover, three distinct bands about 15 kD, 35 kD and 70 kD were identified in oyster hemocytes (Fig. 4C2 ) by using the polyclonal antibody of a typical human CaM CALM1 (Chen, 2017) . The 35 kD and the 70 kD band were identified in all the blank, short and long groups, and the count values displayed an increasing trend with the CO exposure time (Fig. 4C2) . While the 15 kD band was mainly detected in the long group. These results suggested that Ca 2+ -CaM signal pathway might play vital roles in the acclimation of oyster, among which different CaMs might execute diverse regulation function in the response to CO exposure. The mRNA transcripts of NOS, a downstream target of Ca 2+ -CaM signal pathway in oyster (Jiang et al., 2016) was further detected in the present study. The expression level of NOS was significantly up-regulated in the long group while remained unchanged in the short group (Fig. 4C3) . In animals, the activation of NOS is Ca 2+dependent and requires the binding of a Ca 2+ /CaM complex (Kone et al., 2003) . Its products NO can directly or indirectly modulate the activity of Ca 2+ channels or can rapidly react with O 2 \u2022 \u2212 (Mazars et al., 2010) . Compared with vertebrate, there is only one NOS in C. gigas (Jiang et al., 2016) , and the invertebrate NOS was reported to respond to a variety of environmental stresses such as heat, pollution, pH, bacteria and air exposure (Chen, 2017; Giovine et al., 2001; Jiang et al., 2013; Novas et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2000) . Therefore these altered mRNA/ protein expressions could provide an explanation for the reduced oxidative stresses to long-term CO 2 exposure. The up-regulation of NOS indicated that the Ca 2+ -CaM-NOS signal pathway might play important roles in sustaining internal homeostasis and enhancing the capability to deal with environmental fluctuations under long-term CO exposure.",

GO annotation of DEGs revealed that the responses of C. gigas to short-and long-term CO exposure shared common mechanisms in metabolism, membraneassociated transportation and binding processes. While the DEGs related DNA or RNA binding and calcium binding were more abundant in the LVB group. It was suggested that C. gigas might be able to compensate the effect of long-term CO exposure by regulating calcium homeostasis and stimulating the transcription of a series of calcium signal pathways. These compensation responses had a mutual interplay on the physiological status, such as the level of redox reaction, which offered oysters the capability to acclimatize the dynamically changing environment. The results provided valuable information to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the responses of Pacific oyster to the gradually acidified ocean and might have implications for predicting the possible living strategy of marine organisms to the effect of global climate changes.

                "text": "During the past several decades, numerous reports from disparate geographical areas have documented an increased frequency of \"bleaching\" in reef-forming corals. The phenomenon, triggered by increased sea surface temperatures, occurs when the cnidarian hosts digest and/or expel their intracellular, photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts (\"zooxanthellae\" in the genus Symbiodinium). Although coral bleaching is often followed by the death of the animal hosts, in some cases, the animal survives and can be repopulated with viable zooxanthellae. The physiological factors determining the ability of the coral to survive bleaching events are poorly understood. In this study, we experimentally established that bleaching and death of the host animal involve a caspase-mediated apoptotic cascade induced by reactive oxygen species produced primarily by the algal symbionts. In addition, we demonstrate that, although some corals naturally suppress caspase activity and significantly reduce caspase concentration under high temperatures as a mechanism to prevent colony death from apoptosis, even sensitive corals can be prevented from dying by application of exogenous inhibitors of caspases. Our results indicate that variability in response to thermal stress in corals is determined by a four-element, combinatorial genetic matrix intrinsic to the specific symbiotic association. Based on our experimental data, we present a working model in which the phenotypic expression of this symbiont/host relationship places a selective pressure on the symbiotic association. The model predicts the survival of the host animals in which the caspase-mediated apoptotic cascade is down-regulated. B leaching of zooxanthellate corals is a global phenomenon that has dramatically reduced the abundance of corals in tropical reef ecosystems (1, 2) . The phenomenon occurs when environmental triggers lead to the expulsion, digestion, or loss of pigmentation of the photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbiotic algae (of the genus Symbiodinium) within the cnidarian host cells (3) (4) (5) . Although bleaching is highly correlated with increased temperature and high solar irradiance (6-10), it does not always lead to death of the cnidarian host (11) (12) (13) . However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms that lead to death of the cnidarian are not adequately understood (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .",

Some of the characteristic morphological changes during apoptosis (but not during necrosis) include cytoplasmic shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and DNA degradation. Most of these phenomena result from the action of cysteine proteases (i.e., caspases) (25, 26) . In vertebrates, caspase activity is up-regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (25, (27) (28) (29) . ROS can be generated in the coral endodermal cells by photosynthetic activity of the symbiotic algae and by aerobic respiratory activity in the host mitochondria, and are frequently related to coral stress (30) (31) (32) (33) .",

Phenotypic variability leading to regulation of the apoptotic cascade in the coral can potentially prevent death of the coral. We examined the relationship among increased temperature, irradiance, and caspase activity in a variety of zooxanthellate corals maintained under highly controlled conditions in aquaria and under natural environmental conditions in the field. Our results provide a mechanistic framework that combines the response of the algal symbionts and the cnidarian host to thermal stress, leading to the induction of an apoptotic pathway in the animal cells. Based on these results, we propose a phenotypic combinatorial matrix that provides a diagnostic and prognostic profile for assessing whether a cnidarian host is likely to live or die following a bleaching event.",

Transmission electron micrographs ( Fig. 1 ) revealed ultrastructural changes typical of apoptosis in S. pistillata, including membrane blebbing ( Fig. 1A ) and the lateral shift in chromatin to the periphery of the nuclei (Fig. 1C) . Caspase activity increased more than sixfold within 1 wk in S. pistillata ( Fig. 2A ), but decreased 10-fold during the same time period in S. hystrix and remained low for at least the following 2 wk (Fig. 2B ).

In zooxanthellate colonies exposed to 32\u00b0C for 11 h, ROS production was 3.5-fold higher than in control (maintained at 26\u00b0C). Caspase activity followed a similar trend (Fig. S2 ). To test whether ROS induces caspase activity, we examined the effect of exogenous ROS (hydroxyl anion radicals generated by the Fenton reaction) on corals grown at 26\u00b0C. The addition of hydroxyl anion radicals to zooxanthellate containing colonies of M. capitata in the low light regime led to a 40-fold increase in caspase activity after 11 h (Fig.  4B ). In the bleached M. capitata, the addition of exogenous hydroxyl radicals led to a 50-fold increase in caspase activity within 2 h under 26\u00b0C and 50 \u03bcmol photons m \u22122 s \u22121 (Fig. 4B) . In both experiments, the host animal subsequently died. In M. capitata (both containing zooxanthellae and in dark-bleached colonies), exposure to 32\u00b0C for 11 h at full sunlight resulted in increased caspase activity ( Fig. 4C ). However, the activity was much higher in colonies containing zooxanthellae, even at 26\u00b0C.",

Depending on the lipid composition in the algal symbionts, high temperature and irradiance can lead to the energetic uncoupling of the thylakoid membranes (34, 35) , resulting in an increased rate of production of ROS by the algae (35) (36) (37) . The thermal sensitivity of thylakoids is genetically dictated by the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the thylakoids and thus causes a chain of events that will effect numerous downstream reactions (ref. 38 , but see ref. 39) . We hypothesize that, when the net production of ROS by the algal symbiont has exceeded a threshold, these molecules activate a caspase cascade within the host cell (the second component). This second component, which appears to be genetically determined by the cnidarian host, has the potential to result in apoptosis and death of the host. This is supported by the differential response of S. hystrix and S. pistillata to thermal stress (Fig. 2B) . Although both corals bleached, the apoptotic response was elevated in S. pistillata that subsequently died, whereas it decreased in S. hystrix that survived. These results suggest that thermally induced bleaching and death of the host are independent, species-specific processes. That the death of the host resulted from apoptosis is further supported by analysis of the ultrastructural changes in the animal cells ( Fig. 1 ), DNA laddering (Fig. 3) , and the increase in caspase activity.",

                "text": "The likelihood of apoptosis serving as a key component inducing the mortality of host tissue is further supported by two of our experiments. In the first, the introduction of hydroxyl radicals induced high levels of caspase activity despite low ambient temperature and low irradiance conditions, regardless of whether the corals contained zooxanthellae (Fig. 4B) . The results obtained are in agreement with those reported by other investigators (33) (34) (35) (36) , and further suggest that, although zooxanthellae can potentially generate significant amounts of ROS in high light and thereby induce a caspase cascade, the algae can also scavenge ROS under low light conditions, thereby protecting the coral from chronic damage induced by radicals. Moreover, the addition of the caspase inhibitor VAD rescued the host, even under high ROS production. These results strongly suggest that, if the caspase cascade is interrupted, the coral can be rescued from apoptosis and moderate bleaching, regardless of whether elevated temperatures and/or light are the physiological triggers. The involvement of caspase(s) in the host apoptotic response is further supported by our Western blot analysis (Fig. 2) . Caspase activity was correlated with the abundance of an immunoreactive protein, the size of which is in agreement with the predicted amino acid sequence of a caspase cDNA cloned from heat-stressed S. pistillata (Fig. S3) . Hence, if the caspase cascade is arrested at an early stage, the apoptotic response does not occur. Moreover, this response may be controlled by the balance between pro-and antiapoptotic molecules, such as the Bcl-2 and Bax gene families (19, 24, 40) . The exact biochemical sequence triggering the caspase cascade in the host remains elusive; however, based on studies in metazoan models (41), we suggest that the ROS produced by the algal symbionts compromise the structural integrity of mitochondrial membrane in the host cells, thereby stimulating the release of factors initiating a caspase cascade. In the case of sensitive corals, it is most likely that ROS levels will continue to accumulate after bleaching as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction and further evoke the apoptotic machinery (6, 33, 42) .",

If the zooxanthellae are sensitive but 5 . A model explaining the two divergent responses of corals to bleaching, one leading to recovery of the host animal, the other to its death. According to this model, thermal-induced bleaching and apoptosis in zooxanthellate corals are comprised of two major components that form a combinatorial matrix: the first is related to factors that can trigger the apoptotic response. If the zooxanthellae are thermally sensitive (i.e., the physical integrity of the thylakoid membranes in the algal plastid becomes compromised), ROS production from the endosymbiotic algae is accelerated. Second, when the ROS leaks into the host cell, it can initiate a caspase cascade. If the latter occurs, the coral will bleach and die. In the case of sensitive zooxanthellae and a host that does not activate the cascade or down-regulates the activity of caspases, we expect that the bleaching will occur but the host tissue will survive the event. Potential reversion to the original algal community within the bleached colony may occur depending on the environment. If the zooxanthellae are thermally resistant, ROS production will not be accelerated. The host will probably not respond to a high temperature event, i.e., bleach, regardless of whether it has a propensity to activate a caspase cascade.",

Clearly, if sea surface temperatures continue to increase during the next century, a strong selection for corals with algal symbionts that generate less ROS or hosts that do not activate a caspase cascade in response to the production of ROS is to be expected. A similar selection pressure almost certainly occurred 55 million years ago, at the end of the Paleocene, when sea surface temperatures increased sharply in response to a sudden, massive increase in greenhouse warming (48) . Zooxanthellate corals survived that environmental crisis with apparently little loss of diversity, but during the ensuing 50 million years, a slow depletion in atmospheric CO 2 (driven primarily by geochemical weathering reactions), increasingly selected host-algal symbiotic associations that were adapted to lower sea surface temperatures (47) . High temperature-resistant symbiotic phenotypes have persisted in some locations (49) and are potentially poised to become increasingly dominant in the Anthropocene.",

For thermal stress experiments, triplicate colonies were transferred to 300 L aquaria, which were then heated to 32\u00b0C and maintained at that temperature for 2 mo or until the colonies died. P. damicornis and M. capitata were collected from Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. These two species were maintained in 300 L aquaria with flowing sea water at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. Triplicate colonies were tested under four conditions: full natural sunlight (maximum irradiance of 2,000 \u03bcmol photons m \u22122 s \u22121 ), low light (maximum irradiance of 50 \u03bcmol photons m \u22122 s \u22121 ), ambient temperature (26\u00b0C), and elevated temperature (32\u00b0C). M. capitata was induced to bleach by subjecting the colony to a 9-mo darkness stress (51) . The colony was fed with Artemia salina nauplii. For caspase inhibition, coral fragments were incubated for 1 h with 1 \u03bcM of caspase inhibitor VAD (Calbiochem). In all experiments, statistical significance of caspase activity levels between the control and treatment groups was tested by using one-way ANOVA and a t test.",

According to this model, thermal-induced bleaching and apoptosis in zooxanthellate corals are comprised of two major components that form a combinatorial matrix: the first is related to factors that can trigger the apoptotic response. If the zooxanthellae are thermally sensitive (i.e., the physical integrity of the thylakoid membranes in the algal plastid becomes compromised), ROS production from the endosymbiotic algae is accelerated. Second, when the ROS leaks into the host cell, it can initiate a caspase cascade. If the latter occurs, the coral will bleach and die. In the case of sensitive zooxanthellae and a host that does not activate the cascade or down-regulates the activity of caspases, we expect that the bleaching will occur but the host tissue will survive the event. Potential reversion to the original algal community within the bleached colony may occur depending on the environment. If the zooxanthellae are thermally resistant, ROS production will not be accelerated. The host will probably not respond to a high temperature event, i.e., bleach, regardless of whether it has a propensity to activate a caspase cascade.",

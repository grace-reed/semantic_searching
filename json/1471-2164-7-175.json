Microarray technology in particular offers the potential to measure thousands of gene responses simultaneously. However, it is important that microarrays responses should be validated, at least initially, using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). The accurate measurement of target gene expression requires normalisation to an invariant internal control e.g., total RNA or reference genes. Reference genes are preferable, as they control for variation inherent in the cDNA synthesis and PCR. However, reference gene expression can vary between tissues and experimental conditions, which makes it crucial to validate them prior to application. Results: We evaluated 10 candidate reference genes for QPCR in Daphnia magna following a 24 h exposure to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen (IB) at 0, 20, 40 and 80 mg IB l-1. Six of the 10 candidates appeared suitable for use as reference genes. As a robust approach, we used a combination normalisation factor (NF), calculated using the geNorm application, based on the geometric mean of three selected reference genes: glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and actin. The effects of normalisation are illustrated using as target gene leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase (Ltb4dh), which was upregulated following 24 h exposure to 63-81 mg IB l-1 .",

Microarrays are state-of-the-art tools for global gene expression profiling of the response of an organism in a particular biological context. However, expression levels of key genes responding on the microarray need to be validated [2] . The preferred technique of validation is by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) [3, 4] . Although QPCR is a fairly reliable technique, amplification can vary depending on factors such as RNA integrity, reverse transcriptase (RT) efficiencies, sample-to-sample variations in amplification efficiency, and variation in cDNA sample loading. Using the same sample sizes, assessing RNA integrity and equalising RNA concentrations prior to RT are some of the basic normalisation steps in QPCR [5] . However, normalisation to some internal control is essential for accurate QPCR to balance sample-to-sample variations within the RT and PCR reactions. Internal control is generally achieved using reference genes, also known as housekeeping genes.",

                "text": "Some of the most commonly used reference genes, such as \u03b2-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), are historical carryovers from northern blotting, a \"predecessor\" of QPCR [5] . It is good practice to rigorously validate the suitability of these reference genes under the specific experimental condition to which they are applied [5] [6] [7] . Total RNA and rRNA have also been suggested as internal controls, although again differences between tissue, individuals and experimental conditions apply [8] . Moreover, using RNA as an internal control has the disadvantage of not controlling for variation inherent in the RT and PCR reactions [5] . None of these genes or RNA products are completely invariable, and thus each needs validation before use [5] [6] [7] . A further problem of using only one reference gene for normalisation, is that it theoretically should have been normalised itself prior to target gene normalisation [9] . Various methods have been proposed to overcome these problems. One involves the use of a normalisation factor (NF) based on the geometric mean of multiple carefully selected reference genes. This NF can be calculated by geNorm (see Vandesompele et al., 2002 [10] and the geNorm website [11]) or other freely available Excel (Microsoft) based software applications, e.g. BestKeeper [12] (see Pfaffl et al., 2004 [9] ). Vandesompele et al., 2002 [10] recommend that NFs should be estimated from a minimum of three reference genes. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for the cumulative error of the entire process from RNA extraction to the QPCR.",

In a review on the molecular mechanism of NSAIDs in mammals, Tarnawski and Jones, 2003 [20] reveal that it is likely that NSAIDs exert many inhibitory effects, one of which is the inhibition of cell division. The observed suppression of Atb following exposure to IB could be linked to this, since alpha-tubulin helps form microtubules that are involved in cell division, cell structure, and transportation of vesicles and organelles.",

In union with other authors [5, 10, 21, 23] we would like to recommend some basic applications for QPCR: (i) apply a dissociation curve in every QPCR, and omit any samples diverging from the curve; (ii) use a minimum of two non-template controls (NTCs) in every QPCR, and omit any samples having a cycle threshold (C t ) value close to or higher than the mean NTC C t -value; (iii) avoid inter-assay comparison if possible, as it is more appropriate to duplicate the samples in one QPCR than using triplicates of each sample, but having to run two QPCRs (S.N. Peirson, personal communication); (iv) use a NF based on a minimum of three validated reference genes for target gene normalisation [10] ; (v) integrating the DART-PCR approach [23] , which verifies sample-to-sample variations in amplification efficiency with a normalisation factor software package, e.g. geNorm [10] , creates a powerful tool for analysing relative gene expression of target genes.",

This programmed workbook enables calculation of threshold cycles and amplification efficiencies for every sample. Differences in amplification efficiency were assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), based upon the null hypotheses: (i) that amplification efficiency is comparable within sample groups (outlier detection) and (ii) that amplification efficiency is comparable between sample groups (amplification equivalence) [23] . Outliers identified by DART-PCR and samples diverging from the dissociation curve were omitted prior to further analysis.Differences in relative expression were assessed on logtransformed data using ANOVA and Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) for post hoc comparisons. Equality of variance was tested using Levene's test. The relative expression of the reference genes calculated by DART-PCR was exported as an Excel workbook (Micro-soft) to geNorm version 3.4 [10] . The \"geNorm\" algorithm is based on the proposition that, in any set of assays, the expression levels of suitable reference genes should be perfectly correlated. However, because of technical difficulties in assessing correlation in circumstances when there is little variation, a modified procedure is adopted as follows [10] . First, the ratio of expression levels is calculated for any two candidate reference genes. Assuming that the expression ratios should not vary between assays, the variation between the expression ratios is used as an inverse measure, here referred to as gene variability, of the adequacy of the reference genes to be used for normalisation. Thus, the lower the variation, the better the reference genes. Variation is here measured as standard deviation. Given a set of assays that covers the treatments of interest, this procedure can be used to identify the best two reference genes from all possible pairs of reference genes available to the experimenter. A normalisation factor (NF 2 ) is then produced for these two genes, calculated as the geometric mean of their expression levels. The procedure is then extended to assess whether stepwise inclusion of additional reference genes -producing NF 3 to NF n -will reduce the average pairwise variation between them. The optimal number of reference genes to be included in a NF is estimated by comparing the pairwise variation between sequential normalisation factors [10] , e.g. NF 3 vs. NF 4 . All statistical tests were performed in SPSS 12.0.1 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) applying a significant level of 5%, except reference gene variability and NF analysis, which was computed in geNorm version 3.4 [10] .",

Expression levels are displayed relative to the mean control level. For comparison, the normalised relative expression of Ltb4dh is displayed by treatment group. Relative expression of Ltb4dh normalised to: Act (1); Atb (2); Cyp (3); GAPDH (4); SDH (5); TBP (6); WARS (7); UBC (8); 18S (9); 28S (10); NF 3 based on the geometric mean of Act, GAPDH and UBC (11); and Ltb4dh without normalisation (12) (gene name abbreviations as",

    "abstract": "Corals worldwide are facing population declines due to global climate change and local anthropogenic impacts. Global climate change effects are hard to tackle but recent studies show that some coral species can better handle climate change stress when provided with additional energy resources. The local stressor that most undermines energy acquisition is sedimentation because it impedes coral heterotrophic feeding and their ability to photosynthesize. To investigate if reducing local sedimentation will enable corals to better endure ocean warming, we quantitatively assessed the combined effects of increased temperature and sedimentation (concentration and turbidity) on the survival of coral recruits of the species, Porites astreoides. We used sediment from a reef and a boat basin to mimic natural sediment (coarse) and anthropogenic (fine) sediment (common in dredging), respectively. Natural sediment did not negatively impact coral survival, but anthropogenic sediment did. We found that the capacity of coral recruits to survive under warmer temperatures is less compromised when anthropogenic sedimentation is maintained at the lowest level (30 mg.cm \u22122). Our study suggests that a reduction of US-EPA allowable turbidity from 29 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) above background to less than 7 NTU near coral reefs would facilitate coral recruit survival under current and higher temperatures. Coral reefs are one of the most important and biologically diverse ecosystems on Earth. These habitats provide several essential ecosystem services and have significant economic value. Scleractinian corals construct the foundation of the reef by excreting calcium carbonate skeletons, and provide habitat, shelter, nursery areas, and/or food for thousands of plant and animal species 1. Coral reefs are essential in sustaining the livelihood of many coastal communities through the supply of seafood (fisheries), raw materials for medicines, and income through tourism. Reefs also provide important ecosystem services such as physical stabilization of the shoreline and control of the carbon dioxide-calcium budget 2. Corals face multiple natural stressors, but the worldwide population declines registered in the past decades are mostly due to anthropogenic impacts 3-8. Natural stressors include predation, intra and interspecific competition for space, and severe storms. Corals co-evolved with predators and competitors, thus their coexistence should be ecologically stable. Likewise, severe storms physically destroy reefs, however corals evolved in the storm-prone tropics, and thus, in the absence of anthropogenic stressors, corals should be able to recover from these disturbances through natural processes. Recovery after disturbances is dependent on the growth of the surviving coral population through asexual reproduction and/or recruitment through sexual reproduction. Successful coral recruitment requires larval availability, successful settlement, and post-settlement survival and growth. The slow or lack of recovery after disturbances observed in some coral reefs in the past few decades indicates that these natural recovery processes have been undermined by anthropogenic impacts, such as nutrient 8,12 and sediment 13,14 runoff from sewage and land development, and the loss of herbivores due to overfishing 15 or die off from disease (e.g. sea urchin, Diadema antillarum) 16. After a certain threshold, the combination of anthropogenic and natural stressors causes major phase shifts from coral-dominated reefs to less desirable states, such as macroalgae or sponge dominated reef ecosystems 7,16,17 .",

Although sedimentation occurs naturally through wind-driven waves and tidal currents, dredging can increase the duration, severity, and frequency of the sedimentation 18, 19 , with detrimental consequences for coral reefs 14, 20, 21 . Fine sediment (<125 \u03bcm) have the most harmful effects on corals 14, 21 . Natural sediment found on the reef usually has larger grain sizes compared to anthropogenic sediment from construction activities. When turbidity is increased due to the presence of fine particles in the water column, light availability is significantly reduced 14 . Higher levels of turbidity negatively impact corals. Corals obtain much of their energy from endosymbiotic algae Symbiodinium. Under low light conditions, Symbiodinium have lower capacity to photosynthesize and therefore provide less energy to the coral host 3, 20, 22 . Landfills, beach re-nourishment, and coastal construction can also cause burial and physical disturbance of corals 14, 18, 21 . Sedimentation can directly smother corals and block polyps, therefore reducing active feeding mechanisms and depleting energy reserves . In these situations, energy typically used for growth and reproduction is allocated towards clearing sediments that have settled on top of the coral subsequently blocking polyp-feeding structures 14 , lowering calcification rates 14, 23 and reproductive output 3, 14, 24 .",

We used temperatures that mimic the summer average temperature in northern section of the Florida Keys (in years without coral bleaching) and elevated temperatures predicted by climate change models.

Large grain sediment settled quickly and thus, turbidity remained very low (\u22641 NTU, Table 1 ), as is typical on undisturbed reefs 23 . Instead of detrimental, the coarse sediment settled on top of the coral recruits (completely covering them at highest sediment concentrations) reduced their mortality, likely due to conferring protection from excessive light. This study used a level of light irradiance that mimicked natural conditions on the reef (~240 \u03bcmol photons.m \u22122 s \u22122 ), which is ideal for adult corals. However, the ideal light irradiance for adult corals is often deleterious for newly settled corals . This is not surprising considering the well-known preference of coral larvae to settle on crevices and the downward face of settlement tiles, where they are shaded 34, 35 . The reasons for this remain to be understood, but it is possible that at this early stage of development, corals still have relatively small feeding structures and thus cannot provide enough substrate for Symbiodinium to perform photosynthesis, leading either to a depletion of their energy reserves (Symbiodinium burden hypothesis) or oxidative stress, similar to the one caused by increased temperatures 29, 36 . Natural sediment provides cryptic covering from excessive light due to its coarser grain sizes, while still allowing water to flow around the coral recruit and therefore does not limit the availability of oxygen 14 nor access to food. Previous experiments testing the effect of sedimentation on coral recruits in a shallow area assumed that the higher survival of coral juveniles placed in tiles facing downward (vs. vertical and upward) was reflective of lower exposure to sedimentation, and overlooked the reduced light Table 1 .

The observation that corals tend to successfully recruit facing downwards in shallow water, vertically at intermediate depths and facing upwards at greater depths in both the Caribbean 39 and Pacific 38 is also supportive of the hypothesis that light is deleterious during early development. Therefore, we conclude that, within the range tested, natural/coarse sediment is not deleterious for corals. In contrast to natural sediment, anthropogenic sediment hindered the survival of coral recruits. Anthropogenic sediment arising from dredging, construction, and development activities is mostly small grained (<180 \u00b5m), and often contains silt (<63 \u00b5m) and contaminants 14, 19 . Small-grained particles become easily suspended in the water column, increasing turbidity and therefore corals' access to light ( Table 1) . A decreased access to light is problematic for adult corals because it reduces the capacity of the symbiotic algae Symbiodinium to photosynthesize and thus feed the coral 14, 23 . For coral recruits, an increase in turbidity may actually offer protection from excessive light. Regardless, high levels of turbidity are indicative that the type of sediment that is covering the corals is deleterious. Fine sediment (silt) can smother corals, particularly coral recruits, because it damages the coral tissue and reduces the access to oxygen creating anoxic conditions that suffocate them and facilitate the development of active bacterial community, which can further harm them 14, 40 . For example, we found that, at current temperatures, increasing turbidity from 4.62 to >14.2 NTUs leads to a 50% drop in the survival of P. astreoides recruits in the first month (Fig. 2) .",

The coral recruits used in both experiments were in the same developmental stage (one-polyp), but had different ages (1 and 5 months, respectively). Due to the age difference, the effect of sediment type on coral recruit survival could not be statistically tested. However, considering that fine sediments have been repeatedly shown to be more harmful to corals than coarse sediment 40, 41 , and that corals have a strong age-and size-dependent mortality, with younger individuals being more sensitive to stress [42] [43] [44] , we argue that the differences are due solely to sediment type. Since we tested the natural (theoretically, less harmful) sediment first, i.e. on the younger individuals, if anything, the differences found in the effect of sediment concentration on recruit survival between the two sediment types may be underestimated.",

It is well known that increased temperatures cause coral mortality 26, 27, [45] [46] [47] . Corals evolved in a relatively stable thermal environment and thus can only persist within a relatively narrow temperature range 27, 48 . Exposure to warmer temperatures increases oxidative stress in corals 36 and causes the breakdown of the coral-algae symbiosis 29 . Higher temperatures also accelerate the metabolic rate of animals and thus lead to a faster consumption of energy reserves , heightening mortality. Increasing temperature (4 \u00b0C) caused a drop in survival similar to increasing anthropogenic sedimentation (Fig. 2) ; when both stressors are present, coral recruits displayed even higher mortality, which indicates that these stressors have an additive effect. The results of this study indicate that to properly understand and ultimately, regulate the deleterious effects of sedimentation, both deposited sediment concentration sedimentation and turbidity need to be monitored. Deposited sediment concentration alone is not a good indicator of impact on the coral, since whether the sedimentation effect is positive or deleterious seems to be dependent on the grain size of the sediment. Additionally, the levels of turbidity directly reflect the type of sediment that is covering the coral. When turbidity is high, it means that the sediment settled on top of the coral is fine grained and thus highly deleterious for coral recruits .",

Currently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates water turbidity for Florida coastal waters not to exceed 29 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units) above background, during construction and nourishment operations , regardless of the duration of the event. The results of this and many other studies 14, 22, 45 indicate that these limits are extremely high for coral reefs. After four weeks of exposure to low turbidity (<7 NTU), 80% of P. astreoides recruits remained alive; exposure to turbidity levels above 29 NTU led survival to drop to 10%. The coastline of Florida is composed of different types of ecosystems, such as mangroves, seagrass beds, oyster reefs, saltmarshes, and coral reefs, with different sensitivities and resilience to fine sedimentation and turbidity. Therefore, establishing ecosystem-specific limits may prove to be a more effective way to protect natural resources which are invaluable for the local fishing and tourism industries. Recently, the dredging of the Miami Port and beach re-nourishment projects in South Florida have negatively impacted hundreds of acres of coral reefs 18, 50 . Our results suggest that coral recruits were also likely negatively affected by the port dredging, undermining the recovery of the coral population 4, 10 . A reduction of sedimentation in coastal areas should positively contribute to the replenishment of local coral populations after natural and human-induced global disturbances, such as severe storms and bleaching events.",

Corals are very sensitive to warming, but a worldwide concerted action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is out of the sphere of action of local managers. However, coral resilience to this global stressor could be boosted by reducing the magnitude of local anthropogenic stressors that limit energy acquisition in corals, particularly when their effects are additive or synergistic. The survival of P. astreoides recruits under warm temperatures was maximized at the lowest anthropogenic sedimentation tested (30 mg.cm \u22122 deposited sediment, 6.55 NTU, Table 1 ), and is similar to the survival registered by recruits kept at current temperature (26 \u00b0C) and higher anthropogenic sedimentation (\u226560 mg.cm \u22122 , \u226514.2 NTU). This suggests that, if sedimentation is limited to lower levels (30 mg.cm \u22122 , <7 NTU), coral resilience to ocean warming is maximized. Furthermore, the additive effect of sedimentation and warming also indicate that, when unavoidable, dredging and costal construction should be restricted to cooler times of the year. This would minimize the deleterious additive effects of sedimentation and temperature which are more harmful to coral recruits.",

The scleractinian coral species Porites astreoides is a brooding species (i.e. releases fully developed competent planulae) abundant in South Florida and the Caribbean at depths of 3-20 m. Its shallow occurrence makes it vulnerable to bleaching and coastal construction 27 . Four days prior to the new moon in April 2015, eighteen adult colonies with less than 20 cm diameter were collected from two artificial patch reefs (24\u00b044.004\u2032 N, 80\u00b049.577\u2032 W and 24\u00b043.908\u2032 N, 80\u00b049.634W) off Layton, in the Florida Keys (ambient seawater temperature was 26 \u00b0C, and light irradiance was ~220 \u03bcmol.m \u22122 s \u22121 at noon, measured using a Li-Cor Li250A with an Underwater Quantum Sensor LI-192). Colonies were transferred to NSU's facilities and placed into individual 2 L plastic bowls within a recirculating 2000L outdoor tank, and supplied with filtered seawater at an average rate of ~ 1.3 L.min \u22121 . Temperature and light intensity were set to mimic conditions in nature, using shade cloths and a combination of heaters and chiller. Planulae were collected using a manifold system with rubber tubing that directed water into the bowl. The water flow transported the planulae from bowl into the PVC cups fitted with plankton mesh (100 \u00b5m) at the bottom. Every morning, the cups were examined for planulae. Larval release started on the day after collection and the peak release (~5,000 planulae) occurred two days before the new moon; the number of larvae released decreased gradually until two days after the new moon. Every day, the planulae were pooled to mimic natural production in nature, transferred to 100 L tanks equipped with air pumps, kept at 26 \u00b0C and containing ca. 50-100 pre-conditioned settlement tiles (ceramic tiles with 2.5 cm diameter and 0.5 cm height kept in the reef in Broward County, FL at 8 m depth for 2 months to be colonized by bacteria and crustose coralline algae that induce larval settlement). The tiles were inspected every 8 h for planulae settlement, for a maximum of 24 h. Once larvae had settled and metamorphosed, tiles with newly settled recruits were photographed to track juvenile placement. In order to eliminate potential intraspecific effects, when corals settled in group, only one was retained for the experiment (the other(s) were eliminated). Because the quality of the larvae of brooding species can vary over time , each day's batch of newly settled recruits was randomly divided in equal numbers by all treatments, at a maximum of 50 recruits per treatment per day (i.e. all treatments have equal proportions of larvae that settled in each day). The remaining coral recruits were kept in a 2000L outdoor recirculating tank at ambient conditions (26 \u00b0C and ~220 \u03bcmol photons.m \u22122 s \u22121 at noon) and used later on in the second experiment.",

Note that these sedimentation levels do not necessary reflect how much sediment was placed in each tank but the amount that deposited after one day (sediment was just added on the first day; one day was sufficient to cause the heaviest sediment to settle, finer sediment remained suspended due to water flow; turbidity and settled sediment were relatively constant afterwards). Each treatment was split between two 20 L tanks. The sediment was dried at 70 \u00b0C and its composition was assessed according to the Udden-Wentworth US standard classification scale 53 prior to the experiments. Chemical analysis to the sediment were performed by Florida-Spectrum Environmental Services, Inc. Turbidity within each tank was measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTUs) using a LaMotte 2020we Turbidity Meter. The recruit tanks were equipped with two ReSun SP-800 Submersible Aquarium pumps (flow 250 L/h) to allow oxygenation and sediment resuspension, and were individually heated using temperature-regulated, programmable Aqueon Submersible Aquarium 300 W digital heaters (\u00b10.5 \u00b0C). Temperature was monitored daily using a YSI (\u00b10.1 \u00b0C) and was always within 0.5 \u00b0C of the desired temperature. All tanks had a 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod with Aqua Illumination Sol LED lights, with gradual increase until reaching ~230 \u03bcmol photons.m \u22122 s \u22121 between 09:00 and 14:00. Salinity was measured daily using a refractometer, and corrected with RO freshwater whenever it increased above 35. Water quality was controlled and 100% water changes were performed weekly. All individual coral recruits were monitored weekly for survival.",

Specifically, we used the Kaplan-Meier estimator to describe the survival curves, and a Cox model to assess the effects of temperature and sedimentation coral recruit survival. To determine if the survival of coral recruits reared in warmer conditions could be ameliorated under lower sedimentation, we did pairwise comparisons of the survival curves using Mantel-Haenszel (log-rank) tests. Since the second experiment was only planned after the results of the first experiment were obtained, the experiments were analyzed separately and results were not directly compared, i.e. in each experiment we could only test the effects of different degrees of sedimentation on survival, but the data of the two experiments was not combined to test the effect of sedimentation type (natural vs. anthropogenic) on recruit survival.

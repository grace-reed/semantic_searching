    "abstract": "Identification and characterization of marine natural products with antimicrobial, antioxidant activity with minimal toxicity has received much interest over the past few years. Among, Acropora formosa is one of the unexplored marine organism for the screening of natural products in marine resources. In this study, a novel steroid 2-ethoxycarbonyl-2-\u03b2-hydroxy-A-nor-cholest-5-ene-4one (ECHC) was isolated from butanol extracts of A. formosa using vacuum liquid chromatography and sequentially purified by column chromatography. The chemical structure of the compound was elucidated based on spectroscopic analysis including GC-MS, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR and identified as ECHC. Moreover, in vitro antioxidant activity showed that ECHC was highly scavenged the oxidative stress generative molecules. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of ECHC showed excellent activity against human breast cancer cells. Further, in vivo acute toxicity of ECHC on zebrafish Danio rerio was showed no toxicity as well as no morphological damage was observed after 21 days exposure. Histological analysis revealed that there is no apparent difference was observed between ECHC exposure and control group of D. rerio. Together, these results confirmed that ECHC has in vitro antioxidant and anticancer activity and could be developed as a potential drug against most contagious disease like cancer.",

The microscopic analysis of ECHC treated MCF7 cells showed the changes in the cell growth as well as less number of cells compared with control. In other hands, the cytotoxic activity of ECHC against HBL100 normal cells was very less and indicated that ECHC has less toxicity against normal cells (Fig. 10) . The morphology of ECHC treated HBL100 cells showed the similar cell shape and healthy cells compared with control HBL100 cells. As shown in Fig. 11 , the cisplatin increases the cytotoxic activity by increasing the concentration as like as ECHC in MCF7 cells. The microscopic analysis of cisplatin treated MCF7 cells showed the loss of cells, cell detachment and reduced in cell density compared to control MCF7 cells. Together, these results confirmed that ECHC could be a potential anticancer drug in breast cancer treatment.",

A relatively small number of marine organisms studied have already yielded thousands of new chemical compounds; Porifera (class Demospongiae) and Cnidaria (class Anthozoa) being two main sources of new molecules [21] . Moreover, research of species from unexplored geographical sites with a high biological diversity and endemisms, such as species found in tropical regions, can provide novel marine bioactive compounds [22] . Despite the great biodiversity present along the coastline, an important source of potential biologically active compounds, chemical analysis of marine organisms is still incipient. So far, the chemistry of marine natural products has focused on corals, sponges, tunicates and brown algae [23] . The present study reporting that the steroid isolated from Scleractinia coral A. formosa collected in Gulf of Mannar, Southeast Coast of India specifically focusing on their structures and biological activities. Among the 10 different solvent extracts from A. formosa tested for antimicrobial activity against human clinical pathogens, the butanol extract showed good antimicrobial activity against all tested pathogens using agar well diffusion method. The usage of antibiotic disc susceptibility tests or disc-diffusion assays could rapidly identify active metabolites and particularly useful in the initial screening for antimicrobial activity and following activity during chemical purification [24] . Chemicals produced by higher organisms against co-occurring microorganisms may not simply kill or inhibit the growth of the target microorganism but can act selectively against particular phenotypes or characteristics that are expressed by the bacteria [17] . However, Geffen et al. [16] showed that the coral Pocillopora damicornis rapidly release antimicrobial compounds following a mechanical stress. On the other hand, stony corals, as opposed to soft corals, may use non-chemical defences against microorganisms that may include mucus production and sloughing [25] . Extracts of Hawaiian corals exhibited high levels of antibacterial activity, which was selective against different bacterial strains, and varied at the colony, population and species levels [16] .",

After identification of purified compound obtained from butanol extract of A. formosa through chemical characterization further tested for antioxidant activity using various assays. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including free radicals, oxygen ions, and peroxides, are implicated in cell damage. The use of DPPH provides an easy, rapid and convenient way to evaluate the antiradical activities of antioxidants independent of sample polarity [34] .

Unlike ascorbic acid and propyl gallate, the in vitro DPPH radical scavenging activity of vitamin C was significantly high [38] . Chukwurah et al. [39] reported that the absorbance of the control sample was low due to the decreasing of phenanthroline-Fe (II) and the addition of antioxidants can prevent phenanthroline-Fe (II) from oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. Compared to the controls, an increased absorbance was observed of which the magnitude corresponding to the concentration of black coral extract (BCE). The antioxidant compounds in BCE could reduce the oxidation of HO, and the absorbance of BCE groups was close to the blank by chelating reaction of Fe 2+ and phenanthroline [40] .",

The fluorescence quenching measurements have been widely used to study the interaction of drug with proteins such as BSA, HSA, lysozyme, etc. [41] . As results show the emission intensity of BSA depends on the degree of exposure of ECHC and the addition of ECHC resulted in the quenching of fluorescence emission suggesting that the complex formed between the ECHC and BSA. The two hydrophobic tryptophan side chains, 134 and 212 of the protein, to polar solvents and on their proximity to specific quenching groups is evident that changes in the protein secondary structure causing changes in tryptophan environment of BSA occur upon binding with the drug [42] . Histopathology is a basic technique in acute toxicity to provide helpful information for identifying the effect of the drug on various organs of experimental animal and its mechanism of injuries due to enhanced sensitivity of histological monitoring compared with other toxicological parameters such as mortality, behaviour and other physiological changes [43] . In the present study, histological parameters were monitored after 21 days exposure with ECHC and result suggested that ECHC may not cause the oxidative damage and morphological changes in major organs of D. rerio due to the potential antioxidant activity of ECHC. Further, the ECHC has excellent cytotoxic activity against MCF7 cancer cells as well as less toxicity against HBL100 normal cells indicates that ECHC could be a potential anticancer agent in breast cancer treatment. In our previous study, we have reported that ECHC induces the ROS generation in A549 lung cancer and activates p53 mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway [11] .",

The antioxidant analysis of purified compound confirmed that the compound has potent scavenger of cancer inducing oxidative molecules such as DPPH, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl. Further, ECHC has excellent in vitro cytotoxic activity against MCF7 human breast cancer cells.

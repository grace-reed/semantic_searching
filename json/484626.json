As a microeukaryote, it seems to have distinct genomic characteristics, like gene structure and regulation. In the present study, we characterized heat shock protein (HSP) 70/90 of C. polykrikoides and evaluated their transcriptional responses to environmental stresses. Both HSPs contained the conserved motif patterns, showing the highest homology with those of other dinoflagellates. Genomic analysis showed that the CpHSP70 had no intron but was encoded by tandem arrangement manner with separation of intergenic spacers. However, CpHSP90 had one intron in the coding genomic regions, and no intergenic region was found. Phylogenetic analyses of separate HSPs showed that CpHSP70 was closely related with the dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii and CpHSP90 with other Gymnodiniales in dinoflagellates. Gene expression analyses showed that both HSP genes were upregulated by the treatments of separate algicides CuSO and NaOCl; however, they displayed downregulation pattern with PCB treatment. The transcription of CpHSP90 and CpHSP70 showed similar expression patterns under the same toxicant treatment, suggesting that both genes might have cooperative functions for the toxicant induced gene regulation in the dinoflagellate.",

Some species (e.g., Alexandrium tamarense, Amphidinium carterae, Akashiwo sanguinea, Cochlodinium polykrikoides, Gymnodinium, and Karlodinium micrum) are responsible for harmful algal blooms (HABs), affecting fisheries and creating associated economic loss in aquaculture industries [1] . The ichthyotoxic Cochlodinium polykrikoides is one of the most common dinoflagellates that cause HABs, and it has expanded oceanic regions worldwide [2, 3] . Thus, its bloom can cause severe environmental impacts and huge economic losses, due to lots of fish mortalities in aquaculture [4] [5] [6] . In the last three decades, the causative organism has been extensively studied in terms of environmental survey, bloomforming mechanisms, and/or mitigation measures [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ;",

They are distributed into small HSP, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP100, depending on their molecular weight and sequence similarity [12] . HSPs have multiple roles, including membrane translocation, protein degradation, protein folding, and repair misfolded proteins, in regulation of protein homeostasis in normal and stressed cells for regulating protein homeostasis in normal and stressed cells [12, 13] . Hence, HSPs are one of the major genes that can be induced and respond to various stressors, and, of them, HSP70 may be firstly induced under stress conditions rather than other HSPs [12] . Moreover, HSP70 and HSP90 are the most conserved and abundant HSPs and are widely involved in the environmental stressors, such as thermal shock, heavy metal, oxidative damage, hypoxia, and xenobiotic chemicals [12, [14] [15] [16] . For this reason, either HSP90 or HSP70 is considered as biomarker for environmental monitoring [17, 18] . Furthermore, HSP90 and HSP70 may interact with each other, as well as cooperate with other HSPs or chaperone to regulate multisignal transduction pathway [19] [20] [21] .",

Only few studies have investigated the responses of HSP90 and/or HSP70 under environmental stress conditions [26] [27] [28] . For example, we reported HSP70/90 from the dinoflagellates Prorocentrum minimum, suggesting that both genes play diverse roles in physiological responses of the dinoflagellate [27, 28] . So, it is necessary to discover more molecular information for understanding gene regulation mechanisms in adaptive, survival strategies of dinoflagellates, as well as gene and genomic structures. In the present study, we determined full length sequences of HSP90 and HSP70 of the dinoflagellate C. polykrikoides and characterized their gene and genomic features.

CpHSP70 and CpHSP90 EST sequences were used for primer design for full length amplification ( Table 1 ). The 3 -and 5 -untranslated regions (UTR) of these genes were determined by using the 3and 5 -RACE, respectively. For the RACE, nest PCRs were employed, and the primers used in each PCR were listed in Table 1 . Reaction conditions for the primary and secondary PCRs were as follows: predenaturation at 96 \u2218 C for 10 min; 35 cycles of 95 \u2218 C for 30 s, 52 \u2218 C/54 \u2218 C for 30 s, 72 \u2218 C for 100 s, and extension at 72 \u2218 C for 10 min, respectively.

This result was similar to that of Amphidinium carterae [37] . On the other hand, interestingly, we found one intron as in CpHSP90 coding genome (KP010831) (Figure 3(c) ), which was 454 bp in length, but no intergenic region was found, as judged by PCR. This structure was different from that of A. carterae HSP90 genomic sequence (25 introns), and A. carterae HSP90 gene was encoded in tandem arrangement. Although A. carterae HSP90 and CpHSP90 proteins showed highly homologous phylogenic relationships, their genomic DNA represented quite different characteristics.

In the present study, the transcriptional expression of CpHSP90 and CpHSP70 showed similar expression pattern after CuSO treatment (Figure 4) . The transcriptional expression level of these two genes was first upregulated and then decreased with increased concentration of CuSO . The CpHSP90 transcription showed similar expression pattern under 1.0 mg L \u22121 and 5.0 mg L \u22121 CuSO 4 treatments with 5.1-and 4.7-fold changes compared to that of control, respectively. These expression patterns were also displayed by CpHSP70, showing 3.7-and 3.1-fold changes under 1.0 mg L \u22121 and 5.0 mg L \u22121 CuSO treatments compared to that of control. Either CpHSP90 or CpHSP70 was distinctly decreased compared to those of 1.0 mg L \u22121 or 5.0 mg L \u22121 CuSO 4 treatment (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). This result suggested that the CpHSP90 and CpHSP70 may be involved in CuSO 4 induced gene regulation in C. polykrikoides. This result was congruent with our previous results, showing that both genes were considerably induced by exposure of CuSO in the dinoflagellate P. minimum [27, 28] . However, we found that the expression patterns of HSP70 genes were different between C. polykrikoides and P. minimum (Pm) exposed to the same CuSO . The CpHSP70 expression was increased gradually till high dose (8.0 mg L \u22121 of CuSO 4 ), whereas the PmHSP70 expression was the highest level at 1.0 mg L \u22121 and then decreased, possibly due to cell deaths. According to these results, we predicted that the HSP90 and HSP70 are commonly involved in metal CuSO induced gene regulation in the dinoflagellates, but their expression patterns may depend on exposed doses and testing species.",

In the present study, the expression pattern showed response of CpHSP90 and CpHSP70 depending on the doses of the NaOCl. Interestingly, CpHSP90 and CpHSP70 were not induced by lower concentration (0.02 mg L \u22121 ) of NaOCl but significantly upregulated by relatively high concentrations (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg L \u22121 ) of NaOCl (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)). Both CpHSP90 and CpHSP70 in 0.3 mg L \u22121 NaOCl treated cells showed 8.5-and 13.4-fold changes compared to that of control, which were highest expression level among NaOCl treated cells.

The transcriptional expressions of CpHSP70 and CpHSP90 were gradually decreased with increasing PCB concentration ( Figure 5) , with lowest expression level of 0.42-and 0.23-fold under 0.5 mg L \u22121 PCB exposure compared to untreated cultures. However, neither PmHSP90 nor PmHSP70 was up-or downregulated by the PCB exposure in the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimums [27, 28] . According to these results, we speculated that the PCB may have a differential effect on the dinoflagellates among species. The aroclor 1016, which is one of dioxin-like PCBs, was employed. It is clear that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) mediated pathway is involved in the dioxin-like PCBs adverse effect mechanism [45, 46] . A dimer of HSP90 is essential compound that binds to the inactive Ahr protein in the cytoplasm and needs to be released from Ahr protein complex when Ahr is activated [47] [48] [49] [50] . According to these findings, we predict that the CpHSP90 may bind to Ahr and express at a high level in the normal conditions. The CpHSP90 may be released, and then the protein may be activated to participate in the signal transduction of the cells, when C. polykrikoides is exposed to PCB. The essential CpHSP90 amount was decreased with increasing concentration of PCB in the C. polykrikoides. At present, it was not clear; thus we needed more experiments to clarify these gene responses in the dinoflagellate, by using additional EDCs and testing species in future.",

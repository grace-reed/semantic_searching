Using C-labelled natural particulate matter, this study investigates the relationship between concentration and suspension feeding on fine SPM by four common species of Scleractinian coral on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia.

All study species assimilated a major proportion of the ingested label, but assimilation efficiency was inversely related to SPM concentration. At low concentrations (1 mg l), estimates of assimilation efficiency ranged from 89 to 95% of the ingested SPM, decreasing to 40-50% at the highest concentrations (30 mg SPM l). The maximum rate of SPM carbon assimilation can cover less than 5% of basic metabolic costs, which is not significantly different from reported contributions of zooplankton feeding to coral energy budgets. More importantly, SPM feeding at high particle concentrations may cover up to half of the carbon and a third of the nitrogen required for tissue growth.",

Ecol. 232 (1999) 85 -106 coral reefs are considered to be a stress factor for coral assemblages, mainly by reducing light for photosynthesis and smothering coral tissues (review by Rogers, 1990) . Nevertheless, many reefs with high coral cover are found in relatively turbid conditions, such as fringing reefs around inshore continental islands in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Lagoon (Done, 1982; Veron, 1986 ), suggesting that turbid conditions are not necessarily detrimental to corals. On coral reefs, SPM constitutes a diverse food source derived from a variety of sources including detrital matter (Marshall, 1965) , resuspended sediment (Larcombe et al., 1995) , coral mucus (Coffroth, 1990) and excretory products from other animals (e.g., from fish, Meyer and Schultz, 1985) . In addition, such particles are subject to colonisation by bacteria and microalgae, which increases the organic value of this food package (Riley, 1963; Wotton, 1988) .",

Corals on nearshore reefs in the GBR lagoon often experience high concentrations of fine SPM for extended periods of time (up to 20 mg l , Larcombe et al., 1995) which raises the hypothesis that SPM is a potentially more important food source in nearshore habitats than in oligotrophic (offshore) environments. Although heterotrophy has been recognised as an important function of hermatypic scleractinian corals for half a century (e.g., Yonge, 1930) , no studies have quantified the importance of SPM for corals. In a recent study, Mills and Sebens (1997) showed that corals ingest large particles (Artemia cysts) settled on their tissues. The organic content of bedload particles, however, may be less than 0.3% on coral reefs (Johnstone et al., 1990) , whereas that of fine suspended particles is typically above 3% (M. Dommisse, pers. comm.).",

Only a few studies, however, have tested the capacity of corals to utilise SPM (as defined above) as a food source, despite its abundance in many nearshore waters. Attempts to quantify feeding on SPM by corals have mainly used artificial food substrates, including colloidal graphite (Lewis, 1977) , plastic beads (Clayton and Lasker, 1982) , and Artemia cysts (Clayton and Lasker, 1982; Sebens and Johnson, 1991; Helmuth and Sebens, 1993; Johnson and Sebens, 1993) which have little resemblance to natural SPM. Important shortfalls in most early studies on suspension feeding in corals (or by suspension feeders in general) are that the experimental flow regime and particle concentration were often not characterised. Both parameters govern the rate of delivery to the feeding structures of passive suspension feeders (particle flux, Shimeta and Jumars, 1991; Abelson et al., 1993) . Recent studies on suspension feeding have focused on hydro-mechanical aspects of particle capture (e.g., Helmuth and Sebens, 1993; Sebens et al., 1997; Shimeta and Koehl, 1997) rather than on the energetic importance of particle capture. Due to this variation in objectives and experimental protocols among previous studies, the energetic importance of suspension feeding on particulate matter, especially for corals, is still uncertain.",

The choice of coral species was mainly based on two morphological and behavioural properties. Firstly, all species have a digitate to branching growth form and comparable polyp sizes (1-2 mm diameter, Fig.  1 ) which minimise potential effects of geometry on local flow patterns and thus flux of particles and rate of encounter with tentacles (Eckman and Nowell, 1984) . The use of branching rather than massive growth forms ensures that suspension feeding rather than gravitational deposition is quantified (Abelson et al., 1993; Johnson and Sebens, 1993) . Secondly, all species generally have their polyps extended during both day and night, which allows a direct comparison of diel SPM consumption among species.",

All other species were collected from a narrow subtidal depth range (3-4 m below datum) to minimise potential differences in heterotrophic capacity which could arise through differences in feeding strategies in different light regimes. Coral samples consisted of 4-6 cm long terminal branches, cut from the colony with bone cutters. Only one branch was sampled per coral colony, and only widely spaced colonies were sampled to maximise the number of clones in the analysis. Each branch was mounted on a stand consisting of a PVC cup (16 mm high 16 mm wide) with a vertical stalk for attachment to racks and to the bottom of flow tanks (Fig. 2) . The base of each branch was embedded in non-toxic wax to keep the coral firmly attached to its stand, and all mounted branches were placed on racks and transported while submerged to holding tanks with running seawater. Corals were held in the tanks for a maximum of one week prior to experimentation to avoid stress from prolonged exposure to laboratory conditions. ",

Corals were allowed to adjust to chamber conditions for 2-4 h prior to the experiments, during which period the chambers received a constant flow of seawater directly from the reef. The feeding phase was initiated when the polyps of all corals were fully extended, typically at 20:00 h. 14 Immediately prior to a feeding trial, the C-labelled SPM suspension was rinsed three times by centrifugation (3500 rpm for 10 min) to minimise dissolved organic label and added to each chamber through the injection port. Although, rinsing and centrifugation is likely to cause loss of labelled surface bacteria and organic films, the weight-specific radioactivity of the experimental SPM did not vary from that of the stock samples determined by filtration [750 dpm (mg SPM) , see above].",

Uptake of dissolved label was determined from the tissue-radioactivity of corals incubated in filtered (0.45 mm) water to which a labelled filtrate (0.2 mm) was added. This method was preferred over using corals with contracted polyps (non-feeding) as controls, since the latter have a reduced surface for uptake of dissolved matter and thereby produce underestimates of dissolved uptake by feeding corals. The amount of dissolved label added to these control chambers was based on the mean concentration of dissolved label during control runs without corals (sets of four chambers) using two different SPM concentrations (1 and 30 mg l ). To quantify this evolution of dissolved 14 C, four 2-ml water samples were taken at t 5 1, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min, filtered 0.2 mm through 13 mm Nucleopore membranes, fixed in 1% formalin to prevent microbial activity and consequent loss of CO , and determined for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting.

For three of the four species, rate of ingestion increased five-to ten-fold as a function of SPM concentrations between and 21 30 mg l . These three species (Pocillopora damicornis, Montipora digitata and 2 Acropora millepora) showed simple linear feeding responses (R from 0.82 to 0.96) over the wide range of SPM concentrations. P. damicornis showed a tendency to become saturated at high SPM concentrations as indicated by a significant fit to both the piecewise linear and curvilinear models, as well as to the simple linear model (Table 1) . However, estimates of the saturation (C , Hollings type 1) and half-saturation (K, saturation Michaelis-Menten) constants for P. damicornis were located in the upper range of the SPM concentrations used (20 and 28 mg l , respectively), which renders the non-linear models inappropriate for the feeding response of P. damicornis within this range of concentrations (see also Currie, 1982) . Only Porites cylindrica showed convincing saturation as the feeding rate did not increase significantly over the concentration range 4-30 mg l . The feeding response of P. cylindrica could be explained equally well by l , approximately an order of magnitude lower than that estimated for P. damicornis (27.562.0). Of the three linear feeding responses, ingestion rates of P. damicornis and M. digitata were generally higher compared to that of A. millepora as indicated by the results of the ANCOVA (Table 2) . Interestingly, the slopes of the linear feeding responses for P. damicornis, M. digitata and A. millepora were almost identical (0.12-0.136S.E. 0.01, F 50.85, p50.43, Table 1 ). Below the level of saturation, the slope of the feeding 2,71 response for P. cylindrica (0.29) was three-fold those of the three simple linear responses, suggesting that feeding of this species at low SPM concentrations is more directly related to particle availability than for the other species.",

Surprisingly, the relationship between particle concentration and rate of ingestion was a simple linear function of concentration rather than a traditional saturation curve for three out of the four species (P. damicornis, M. digitata and A. millepora). Even particle concentrations mimicking observed peak turbidity regimes in some nearshore coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon (16 and 30 mg l ), did not cause significantly lower rates of ingestion than expected from the linear model. Interestingly, since particle concentrations at the study sites rarely exceed 8 mg l , maximum experimental concentrations were at least three times higher than those normally experienced by these corals. Only P. cylindrica conformed convincingly to traditional saturation-kinetic models by reaching maximum rate of ingestion at low-to-moderate particle concentrations (4-8 mg l ). P. damicornis showed a tendency to become saturated at concentrations .16 mg l , and would most likely saturate at lower concentrations than both M. digitata and A. millepora over a broader range of concentrations.

For three of the four species (P. damicornis, M. digitata and A. millepora) such a plateau was not reached within the range of particle concentrations used in this study. The feeding responses for P. cylindrica, however, was equally well modelled by the rectilinear (Hollings type I) and curvilinear (Michaelis-Menten) relationships. Tentatively, feeding by coral polyps can be modelled analogous to active sites in enzyme kinetics, showing increasing levels of saturation with increasing substrate concentration (curvilinear response) rather than a linear increase up to a certain plateau (rectilinear response). Theoretical models of shapes of feeding responses for filter feeders also predict curvilinear rather than rectilinear responses (Lehman, 1976) . For passive suspension feeders the shape of the feeding response curve is likely to be governed by both morphological, physiological and behavioural characteristics of the organism (Hart and Latta, 1986; Leonard, 1989) . However, an explanation as to why only P. cylindrica showed saturation is not apparent from the results of this study, yet a number of hypotheses appear plausible. Firstly, a lower tentacle cleaning rate as determined by the velocity of ciliary feeding currents (Muscatine, 1973) may be a limiting factor at high particle concentrations. The low cleaning rate of the congeneric Porites lutea in sediment-rejection experiments (Stafford-Smith, 1993 ) adds support to this hypothesis. Secondly, space-limitations of polyp coelenterons may define a limit to ingestion (Lehman, 1976; Taghon and Jumars, 1984) and will be relatively more important for small-polyped species such as P. cylindrica and M. digitata. For example, 21 the maximum SPM ingestion rate for P. cylindrica of 2 mg (cm colony surface) h 21 21",

Furthermore, only 1-h incubations were used in this study (to minimise the build-up and uptake of dissolved label) which may be insufficient time to accumulate enough material to cause saturation (Patterson, 1991) . Periods of high turbidity over reefs are often of the scale of days to weeks (Larcombe et al., 1995) rather than of hours. A common slope (DI /DC) for the three linear responses of 0.12 to 0.13 (60.01, S.E.) indicates that the successful capture and ingestion of fine particles by P. damicornis, M. digitata and A. millepora increases only one-fold for every eight-fold increase in food availability. In the absence of saturation and other factors inhibiting capture and ingestion, the expected increment in feeding rate per increment in food concentration would be closer to unity for passive suspension feeders, given that potential particle capture is directly related to particle flux. For example, the expected slopes of prey capture rate to abundance for Madracis mirabilis (a small-polyped species, Sebens et al., 1996) and P. damicornis (Clayton and Lasker, 1982) in zooplankton feeding experiments were in the order of 0.5. The generally low feeding rates and low slope observed in this study may be related to the small particle size as suggested by aerosol-filtration theory (Rubenstein and Koehl, 1977; Shimeta and Jumars, 1991) . The spacing between tentacle tips for the coral species used in this study was of the order 500-2000 mm whereas the range of particle sizes was 10-100 mm, thereby excluding sieving as a likely mode of capture for corals feeding on fine SPM. Sieving is suggested to be an important mechanism in the capture of zooplankton for both octocorals (Sebens and Koehl, 1984) and scleractinian corals (Sebens et al., 1996) . For particles with diameters only 1 / 20 to 1 / 5 of the spacings between coral tentacles, and at flow velocities typical 21 of lagoonal coral reefs (5-10 cm s ) the predominant mode of capture is most likely direct interception, i.e., the particle follows a streamline that brings it within one particle radius of a tentacle (Rubenstein and Koehl, 1977) . In order for such small particles to be intercepted by a tentacle they must travel in streamlines closer to the tentacles than large particles, and thus have a lower probability of capture than larger particles of similar abundance. For spionid polychaetes, Shimeta and Koehl (1997) found that the probability of encounter increased as the square of the particle diameter, corresponding to an almost 100-fold increase in capture probability with an increase in particle size from 10 to 100 mm.",

According to the model by Abelson et al. (1993) , coral species with a high ratio of body height to basal width encounter high fluxes of small suspended particles, whereas massive and encrusting forms encounter fluxes of predominantly heavier, resuspended material. Also, Sebens et al. (1996) found that Madracia mirabilis (small polyps, branching) captured .36-times more plankton per unit of biomass than Montastrea cavernosa (large polyps, massive). The use of individual coral branches rather than whole colonies in this study, however, may overestimate in situ feeding rates due to partial depletion of the water by polyps upstream, especially in large clones (Anthony, 1997; Sebens et al., 1997) .",

Moreover, it raises the hypothesis that the suitability of a high-turbidity regime for a given coral species may be indicated by the saturation characteristics (parameters C or K) of that species. However, the relative saturation abundances of the four study species in habitats of different turbidity levels along an inshore-offshore transect across the Great Barrier Reef lagoon (Done, 1982) , does not add convincing support to this hypothesis. For example, P. damicornis is abundant in most coral reef habitats across the GBR lagoon from extreme inshore to exposed offshore reefs. Although M. digitata (the best SPM feeder) is often the dominant coral species on shallow mudflats where it is periodically exposed to extremely turbid conditions, P. cylindrica (the poorest SPM feeder) also prospers in extremely turbid habitats (D. Barnes, pers comm.) . Nevertheless, complete saturation of SPM feeding in P. cylindrica at concentrations as low as 2-4 mg l renders this species a poor heterotroph in high-turbidity regimes and supports previous assumptions that members of the genus Porites rely mainly on autotrophy (Johannes and Tepley, 1974; Edmunds and Spencer-Davies, 1989) . Saturation parameters of feeding response curves may therefore not serve as a useful proxy for detecting tolerance levels of corals to high particle loads, but provides a useful tool for estimating the capacity of a species to utilise the particle availability in a given turbidity regime.",

Although this labelling method is satisfactory to provide a marker for ingestion, assuming that the label is homogenously distributed among particles, it will almost certainly overestimate assimilation efficiency (Lopez et al., 1989) . Since most suspension and deposit feeders will readily digest and assimilate the live organic coating and reject / egest the less labelled refractory matrix (see review by Wotton, 1994) , assimilation will reflect the utilisation of the more intensely labelled live organic matter rather than the whole particles. Notwithstanding this source of error, the community of microorganisms coating the fine particles (which are targeted in the labelling process) presumably constitute the most nutritionally important component of suspended particulate matter. The results of this study demonstrate that the major proportion of this organic component is utilised by suspension feeding corals, even at the highest concentration used.",

This value is approximately eight times the feeding rate found in this study. However, the feeding rates of P. damicornis as found by Clayton and Lasker (1982) are not readily comparable to those in this study due to differences in experimental protocol and types of food. The mean size of Artemia nauplii is 600 mm compared to a particle size range of 10-100 mm in this study, resulting in a several-fold higher capture probability of nauplii due to size per se, and even more so if capture of nauplii is aided by sieving (see above) and gravitational deposition.",

                "text": "Relative to daily respiratory and photosynthetic carbon fluxes, the contribution of carbon from SPM appears to be insignificant. For example, using an organic carbon content of 5% for fine SPM in the study area (M. Dommisse, pers. comm.) and an assimilation efficiency of 79% (Fig. 6) (cm surface area) d at the highest particle concentration (30 mg l ). For comparison, Muscatine et al. (1984) reported rates of respiration and gross photo-21 21 synthesis in Stylophora pistilata of 125 and 138 mg C (cm surface area) d , respectively. Despite a small contribution to daily energy budgets, feeding on SPM may, however, be important for coral growth. It is well documented that most of the carbon translocated from zooxanthellae is lost as respiration or excretion (e.g., Spencer-Davies, 1984; Falkowski et al., 1984) , in part due to low contents of N and P necessary for tissue synthesis. Assuming a 1 to 5% daily increase in tissue mass in P. damicornis (Spencer-2 Davies, 1991) and an animal carbon content of 0.94 mg per cm surface area (Muller-Parker et al., 1994) , the carbon-specific growth rate of this species ranges from 9 to 46 mg C per cm per day (24 h). At high particle concentrations (30 mg l ), the daily assimilation of 4.75 mg organic carbon per cm from SPM can thus potentially account for 10-52% of the growth needs in P. damicornis. The low respiratory loss of C assimilated from SPM (13-34%, Fig. 7 ) supports the hypothesis that a large proportion of the heterotrophic carbon is channelled into growth. Applying similar calculations and assumptions to assimilation of nitrogen suggests that particle feeding can account for 7-33% of the tissue growth, given an organic C:N ratio of 6.4 for coral animal tissue (Muller-Parker et al., 1994) and 10 for fine SPM (Anthony, unpublished) .",

Based on a mass-balance estimate for Acropora palmata, Bythell (1988) suggested that 70% of the required nitrogen intake came from particulate feeding. Fine SPM provides a large surface area for colonisation by microorganisms and hence a coating with organic nutrients (Wotton, 1994) . Concentrations of macronutrients (N and P) bound up with fine SPM in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon are almost two orders of magnitude higher than concentrations of dissolved macronutrients (M. Dommisse, pers. comm.), rendering fine SPM a potentially important vehicle for nutrient delivery to corals, even at low rates of consumption.",

Daily intakes of SPM in this study are not significantly different from estimated feeding rates on zooplankton feeding by Scleractinian corals in situ. For example, Porter (1974) found that zooplankton feeding by Montastrea cavernosa could account for only between 0.2 and 11% of the coral's daily energy requirements. Furthermore, Johannes et al. (1970) estimated that the availability of zooplankton in coral-reef waters is sufficient to cover only 5.4% of the coral's dark respiration. Due to a high content of nitrogen and phosphorus in zooplankton (Corner and Davies, 1971) , however, this food source is likely to be more efficient than SPM in delivering nutrients to corals. Nevertheless, contrary to nocturnal zooplanktivores, the polyps of species such as P. damicornis, M. digitata, A. millepora and P. cylindrica are also expanded during the day, and thus have the potential for sustaining their heterotrophy full time. Furthermore, concentrations of fine SPM on inshore reefs do not show the diel patterns characteristic of zooplankton (Porter, 1974) and may stay high for extended periods of time, maintained mostly by wind and swell (Larcombe et al., 1995) . P. damicornis, M. digitata and A. millepora, which all ingest SPM as a linear function of concentration, may thus have higher daily heterotrophic intakes than nocturnal zooplanktivores in lagoonal, high-turbidity habitats.",

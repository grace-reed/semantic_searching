It has been widely shown that UV-B (290-320 nm) and UV-A (320-400 nm) penetrate the different skin barriers and lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2] , inducing oxidative damage resulting in lipid membrane alteration [3, 4] or DNA mutations [5, 6] . Up until recently, blue light (400-500 nm) irradiation effects were poorly investigated. Even though its impact on the sleep cycle, memory, and retina is clearly highlighted, its impact on skin cells is still under examination [7] [8] [9] .",

Some contain organic filters (i.e., avobenzone, octinoxate, benzophenone, or octocrylene) that are increasingly criticized by consumers and countries due to their environmental impact [10] [11] [12] . Indeed, Hawaii recently issued a bill, effective on 1 January 2021, against the use and sale of sunscreen containing avobenzone or octinoxate [13] . These molecules have been the subject of many studies in the last few years to demonstrate their negative impact on corals [14] [15] [16] . Indeed, avobenzone and octinoxate (Scheme 1) are two ingredients contributing to coral bleaching; if they do not directly kill corals, they put them under significant stress and subject them to increased mortality levels. Moreover, the (photo)degradation of these products in water promotes the formation of chlorinated phenols well-known to be mostly toxic [17] . Endocrine disruption related to these products has also been highlighted for several years [18, 19] and repeated exposures may induce serious developmental effects on reproductive organs and the central nervous system. Still, too few alternatives are proposed to reduce the use of this type of organic filter. The most common are mineral filters such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, which are also widely criticized [20, 21] . Indeed, nanoparticles may induce inflammatory diseases or exacerbate respiratory allergies and asthma [22] . They are also involved in cardiovascular diseases and promote certain lung cancers [23] . Although the existing UV filters regulatory lists greatly limits the use of new filters, particularly in China, it is essential to offer new organic UV-A and UV-B filters able to protect humans against the harmful effects of the sun while reducing environmental and public health risks.",

Indeed, nanoparticles may induce inflammatory diseases or exacerbate respiratory allergies and asthma [22] . They are also involved in cardiovascular diseases and promote certain lung cancers [23] .

Very similar spectra were obtained for the phenolic series with absorbance ranging from 300 nm to 475 nm ( Figure 1A ). The wavelength coverage for the simplest phenolic molecule (3) is close to that of avobenzone, but with a lower absorbance. Substituting the phenol moiety with auxochromes (-OH, OMe) resulted in a bathochromic shift of the maximum absorbance, leading to a wavelength coverage that includes part of the UV-A and blue light regions (1, 2, and 4). Switching from coumaric (3) to furan moiety (5) allowed to get a \u03bbmax (361 nm) closer to that of avobenzone (357 nm). Results for the furanic series ( Figure 1B) show a bathochromic shift alike the phenolic series, depending on the electronic effects of the substituents on the furan moiety. With just one substituent on the aromatic ring (7, 8, and 10), only a small blue shift is observed regardless of the substituent complexity. Introducing a second group on the furan ring leads to a further shift toward blue light that depends on the nature of the substituent and its impact on the conjugation. As expected, the presence of a benzene ring on compound (9) conjugated to the furan moiety further expands the \u03c0-system and results in a shift further into the blue light spectrum, but without a significant change in absorbance. An increase of the maximal absorbance can be observed with a significant increase of the conjugation on the furan moiety (11) . However, intermediate absorbance values and blue light shifts are obtained with two unconjugated and not bulky substituents (6) (i.e., methyl groups). Finally, the anti-UV properties of the pyrrolic moiety were investigated ( Figure 1C ). Compared to coumaric (3) and furan (5) , the presence of a simple pyrrole ring (12) afforded an absorbance at the frontier between UV-A and blue light regions (\u03bbmax = 393 nm). As seen with the previous two series, substitution on the aromatic ring (13) provided a bathochromic shift, accentuated with a higher conjugation (14) , without a significant modification of the maximal absorbance. The study of the structure-activity relationship on the different aromatic moieties highlights the fact that UV properties of such molecules can be fine-tuned by judiciously adjusting the nature of the substituents and conjugation system.

For both furanic series (9 and 11) and pyrrolic series (14) , an increase of conjugation, either with a benzene ring (9 and 14) or through a carbon-carbon double bond (11), led to a higher loss of absorbance. The same conclusion can be drawn for the introduction of a sensitive functional group such as an ester (10) . On the contrary, introduction of a primary alcohol in the furan moiety (8) did not result in a higher loss of absorbance as one could have expected with the aforementioned observations, but in a slightly lower loss of absorbance compared to its alkyl analog (7) . As with absorbance and wavelength coverage, photostability of the molecules is highly impacted by the extent of conjugation, the latter having a negative impact.",

Despite their natural presence, they can also be harmful when the organism is not able to regulate their level through endogenous antioxidants. Thereby, high concentrations of ROS, which can result from overexposure to the sun for example, have been linked to skin photoaging, inflammations, oxidative stress, or skin carcinogenesis [1] . To limit these harmful effects, antioxidants are conventionally added to sunscreen formulations. The most commonly used molecules are butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). If the novel filters developed herein exhibited antiradical properties in addition to UV absorption, they would protect the skin from UV/blue light radiation while preventing the negative consequences of such exposure by regulating the quantity of ROS generated, without having to add any other compound in the formulation. To determine the potential of the synthesized molecules as antiradicals, their EC 50 value (half maximal effective concentration), defined as the quantity (in nmol) of antiradical compound needed to reduce 50% of free radicals, was evaluated. The lower the EC 50 value, the better the antiradical. Tests were performed by using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) as a free radical and monitoring its disappearance, results are shown in Table 1 . Antiradical properties for the phenolic series have already been described and are in accordance with those measured [33] . Within the furanic and pyrrolic series, only three derivatives demonstrate antiradical activity (5, 8, and 11) but with poor EC 50 values (>80 nmol). Of all the synthesized compounds, as expected, only those possessing a phenol moiety exhibited antiradical properties, with only 1 and 4 being competitive against the two commercial references.",

This hyperpigmentation is due to an abnormal production of melanin, a pigment present in human skin cells that is initially responsible for tanning to protect the skin against UV radiations. This pigment is produced from tyrosine by the action of tyrosinase during melanogenesis. Pigmentary disorders result mainly from an overproduction of melanin due to cell degeneration linked to high sun exposure. One way to limit the appearance of these age spots is to inhibit tyrosinase activity, thus locally reducing the production of melanin and decreasing pigmentation. Tyrosinase inhibition is widely described in the literature [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . In tubo inhibition tests can be performed using a fungal tyrosinase to mimic human tyrosinase activity, making it possible to identify whether the molecules tested can potentially exhibit valuable secondary activity in addition to their UV filter and antioxidant properties. Kojic acid can be used as a reference in terms of in tubo tyrosinase inhibition [41] . In order to position our molecules with respect to this reference, we determined the EC 50 value, defined as the concentration (in \u00b5M) of product needed to reduce 50% of the tyrosinase activity ( Table 2 ). The lower the EC 50 value, the better the inhibition. Interesting values are obtained for the phenolic series, in particular for compounds 1, 2, and 4 that have EC 50 very close to that of kojic acid. Some molecules of the furan series exhibit EC which is relatively high (>100 \u00b5M) or has no activity at all. Pyrrolic series present no activity. Through this preliminary study of tyrosinase inhibition, three molecules were found competitive against kojic acid, but these results need to be confirmed on cells.",

                "text": "In the last years, studies have shed light on the ability of organic UV filters to act as endocrine disruptors [43, 44] whose continuous exposure can cause serious developmental effects on reproductive organs and the central nervous system [45] . To evaluate potential health risks associated to the newly synthesized UV filters, their ability to interact with estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1), androgen receptor (AR), and pregnane X receptor (PXR) was evaluated. ER\u03b1 activity is regulated by the steroid estrogen sex hormone E2 (17\u03b2-estradiol). AR is activated by binding with any androgenic hormones, and finally PXR is a member of the steroid and xenobiotic sensing nuclear receptors family. All three receptors were tested in the absence (agonist test) or presence (antagonist test) of their respective agonist control molecule, E2 (17\u03b2-estradiol), R1881 (methyltrienolone), and SR-12813 for ER\u03b1, AR, and PXR, respectively. Endocrine disruption assays were performed on four molecules-3, 5, 8, and 12-as they present the basic structures for phenolic, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and pyrrole derivatives. Tests were performed using different concentrations (from 3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M) and we focused on the results for the concentration of synthesized molecules needed to obtain the previously described UV properties (i.e., 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M). Results in Figure 4A show that the four molecules barely interact with receptors, demonstrating the absence of agonist effects. For antagonist properties, synthesized molecules were mixed with the agonist control molecule of each receptor.",

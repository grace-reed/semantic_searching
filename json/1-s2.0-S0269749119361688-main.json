    "abstract": "The potential influence of microplastic debris on marine organisms is an issue of great ecological and socioeconomic concern. Experiments exposing fishes and invertebrates to constant concentrations of microplastics often yield high variation in particle ingestion rates among individuals. Yet, despite an increasing interest in microplastic ingestion in the wild, the potential intrinsic drivers of inter-individual variation have received little attention so far. Here we assessed individual-level ingestion of Polyethylene microspheres by laboratory-reared juvenile anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris, in relation to (a) ambient particle concentrations and (b) repeatable behavioural traits. We show that microplastic ingestion is highly variable at all tested particle concentrations and that this variation can partially be explained by individual activity levels. Moreover, the relationship between ingestion and behavioural variation increased notably when only the most behaviourally consistent individuals (n \u00bc 40 out of 60) were considered in the analysis. Our findings indicate that microplastic ingestion rates in juvenile reef fishes may be less dependent on ambient concentrations than expected; instead they are to some degree phenotype-dependent. Care should thus be taken when reporting mean responses to microplastic exposure treatments, because some individuals may not be affected in the same way as others due to differential ingestion behaviour. We also discuss potential ramifications of non-random ingestion variability on population-and community-level responses.",

Plastic debris has now been detected in every marine ecosystem of the planet, ranging from coral reefs to the Arctic ice sheet and the deep sea (Auta et al., 2017) . Global input of plastic waste into the ocean continues to increase (Jambeck et al., 2015) and the weight concentration of plastics in the pelagic environment is predicted to double by 2030 (Isobe et al., 2019) . Microplastics are of particular concern because their small size (0.1 mm -5 mm) makes them available for inadvertent consumption by a wide range of taxa (Wright et al., 2013) , including mammals, reptiles, birds, invertebrates and fishes (Egbeocha et al., 2018; Markic et al., 2019) .",

                "text": "The ingestion of plastics may cause harm through damage to the gastrointestinal tract, intestinal blockage, creating a false feeling of satiation or leaching of toxic chemicals (Jovanovi c, 2017). However, the reported impacts of microplastic exposure on an organismal level vary widely (Foley et al., 2018) . For instance, some studies found limited to no impacts on physiology, behaviour or survival of marine fishes (e.g., Mazurais et al., 2015; Tosetto et al., 2017; Jacob et al., 2019) , while others detected significant negative effects on feeding rates, growth, body condition, survival, swimming speeds, as well as altered behaviours and differential gene expression (de S a et al., 2015; Mazurais et al., 2015; Barboza et al., 2018a,b; Choi et al., 2018; Critchell and Hoogenboom, 2018; Naidoo and Glassom, 2019) . The early life history stages of fishes are known to be particularly vulnerable to pollutants due to their small size and less developed immune systems (Weis and Weis, 1989) . At the same time, early life stages constitute a critical bottleneck for population replenishment because they naturally experience high rates of mortality (Hixon, 1991; Almany and Webster, 2006) . This mortality is not random across a cohort in that faster growing, larger individuals have a selective advantage comparted to slower growing, smaller conspecifics (Anderson, 1988; Meekan et al., 2006) . Individual growth rates in turn are affected by multiple intrinsic (e.g., size at hatching) and extrinsic (e.g., temperature) factors, but are largely driven by food consumption (Boisclair and Sirois, 1993; Wang et al., 1998) . It should thus be advantageous for an individual to maximise food intake relative to intraspecific competitors. Where natural planktonic food items are increasingly being replaced by microplastic particles, however, a high consumption capacity may work to an individual's disadvantage.",

However, not all individuals are equally consistent and there may be significant inter-individual differences in intra-individual variation in behaviour (Stamps et al., 2012) . In other words, some individuals are more predictable than others. Between-and withinindividual behavioural variation may have far-reaching ecological consequences (Biro and Stamps, 2015) and both may play a role in microplastic ingestion.",

Pairs were maintained in separate 90 l tanks with flow-through seawater at 28 C in a 12/ 12 h light cycle. Breeding pairs laid egg clutches on the inside of terracotta pots placed in their aquariums for shelter. On the night of hatching (7e9 days post laying), egg clutches were transferred from the parental aquarium to a 60 l black, round larval rearing tank. After hatching, larvae were reared in a semi-closed greenwater culture where aquariums had no water exchange during the day and were slowly flushed with filtered, UV-sterilized seawater each night (~1 l min \u00c01 ). This cycle ensured that larvae could feed ad libitum throughout the day and that any unconsumed food was removed each night. Each morning, diluted algal paste (Nanno 3600) was added to the rearing tank to increase turbidity, thereby reducing larval stress, increasing contrast for larval foraging and adding indirect nutrition (Palmer et al., 2007) . Larvae were fed rotifers (Brachionus sp.) at approximately 5 individuals ml \u00c01 each morning for the first 3 days, after which Artemia nauplii were added at 1 individual ml \u00c01 . The ratio of Artemia to rotifers was increased each day until larvae were only fed Artemia (5 individuals ml \u00c01 ) from day 8. Larvae were reared to the juvenile stage. To standardize hunger-levels, fish were not fed during the last 48 h before the experiments.",

Our findings indicate that microplastic ingestion by the coral reef fish A. ocellaris is not random and that some behavioural phenotypes may be more (less) exposed than others due to inherently higher (lower) consumption levels. Specifically, we found that (1) microplastic ingestion in juvenile anemonefish is highly variable, even among closely related individuals; (2) that this variation may be driven to some degree by inter-individual variation in behavioural traits; and (3) that this relationship is stronger in individuals exhibiting lower levels of intra-individual variation.",

In both cases, the quantity of ingested particles showed only limited relationships with fish size. Likewise, we found that size related to ingestion rates in some instances, but not in others (i.e., only within the highest concentration treatment [Table S1 ] and in the data subset but not the full data set [Fig. S4 , Table S3 ]). Critchell and Hoogenboom (2018) further reported that, in another experiment, neither the proportion of fish that had ingested plastics, nor the number of ingested particles per fish were related to the concentration of particles in different treatments (0e0.1 mg l \u00c01 , Polyethylene spheres, 1e2 mm, 1.38 g cm \u00c03 ). While here we did detect a mean increase in ingested spheres with particle concentration, we also found high variation of ingestion at all concentrations (Fig. 1a) . When large quantities of particles were available in the water, some individuals filled their entire gastrointestinal tract with plastics ( Fig. S1 ) while others ingested none or only a small number of spheres. This finding entails that microplastics act differently than most other anthropogenic impacts (e.g., Fig. 2 .

Coefficients of determination represent marginal pseudo-R 2 values estimated from linear mixed effects models (see methods section). temperature, ocean acidification or chemical pollution), in that exposure to and hence the potential effects of microplastics in laboratory studies will likely not be uniform across individuals. Care should thus be taken when reporting mean responses to microplastic exposure, as some individuals may not be affected in the same way as others due to differential ingestion behaviour.",

Among others, behavioural traits have been linked to the acquisition of food resources in that bolder, more aggressive and/or more active individuals typically have higher intake rates (Biro and Stamps, 2008) . Our findings indicate that more active behavioural phenotypes within populations (and even within clutches) of juvenile anemonefish may ingest more microplastic particles than less active individuals when exposed to the same particle concentration (Fig. 2) . More active phenotypes may hence be subject to higher microplastics exposure than less active individuals, even if they encounter similar ambient particle concentrations in the wild. Whether this observation is a result of inherently higher food intake rates of more active individuals that mistake microplastics for food (e.g., de S a et al., 2015) , or whether more active individuals simply have a higher encounter rate with suspended particles (e.g., L\u00f8kkeborg and Fern\u20ac o, 1999) remains to be investigated.",

                "text": "Phenotype-dependent microplastic ingestion may have farreaching consequences for marine fish populations and communities. Activity often forms a behavioural syndrome with boldness in that more active individuals are typically bolder and more prone to taking risks (Sih et al., 2012) . This syndrome represents a wellknown trade-off between higher growth rates (via increased food intake) and an increased probability of predation (via risky behaviour) (Biro et al., 2006) . This trade-off is mediated by the bigger-is-better hypothesis, where larger individuals have a selective advantage in terms of predation rates (Meekan et al., 2006) . However, if more active (possibly bolder) individuals are also more likely to consume larger quantities of microplastics, the relationship between consumption, growth and survival may be disrupted. Not only may higher plastic intake reduce individual growth rates (e.g., Critchell and Hoogenboom, 2018) , but short-term exposure may also increase predation-related mortality in the field (McCormick et al. unpublished results) . In highly plastic-contaminated areas, more active phenotypes may thus experience elevated vulnerability to predation due to a combination of their inherent behavioural predispositions (i.e., increased risk) and the effects of high microplastic ingestion (i.e., decreased body condition and escape performance). This hypothesis is particularly relevant for early life stages, because pelagic larvae may be more exposed than demersal life stages. Oceanographic features, such as surface slicks and eddies, were shown to aggregate both microplastics and fish larvae, resulting in higher particle exposure within such features than in adjacent waters (Markic et al., 2018; Lestrade et al. unpublished results) .",

Behavioural consistency hence appears to be an important factor driving phenotype-dependent microplastic ingestion, providing another indication that varying levels of intra-individual variation are more than random sampling noise (Stamps et al., 2012) . Behavioural variability in the less consistent third of individuals stemmed, to the most part, from a disproportionate increase in activity during the second open field trial (Fig. S2) . This pattern was unrelated to specific experimental runs or clutch identity. We can thus assume that these individuals have an inherently higher level of intra-individual variation, possibly making them less predictable not only in terms of activity levels, but also regarding plastic ingestion rates.",

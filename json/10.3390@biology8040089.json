The effects of salinity stress on physiological performance are largely species specific, but may also depend on intra-specific differences in physiological capabilities of sub-populations. We measured critical swimming speed (Ucrit) and metabolic rates during swimming and at rest at salinities of 0 and 10 in European perch (Perca fluviatilis) from a low salinity tolerance population (LSTP) and a high salinity tolerance population (HSTP). Ucrit of LSTP was significantly reduced at a salinity of 10 yet was unaffected by salinity change in HSTP. We did not detect a significant cost of osmoregulation, which should theoretically be apparent from the metabolic rates during swimming and at rest at a salinity of 0 compared to at a salinity of 10 (iso-osmotic). Maximum metabolic rates were also not affected by salinity, indicating a modest tradeoff between respiration and osmoregulation (osmo-respiratory compromise). Intra-specific differences in effects of salinity on physiological performance are important for fish species to maintain ecological compatibility in estuarine environments, yet render these sub-populations vulnerable to fisheries. The findings of the present study are therefore valuable knowledge in conservation and management of estuarine fish populations.",

Consequently, species diversity is highest in either fresh or marine habitats, and decreases from both ends of the salinity gradient towards intermediate salinities in estuaries, which constitute a mixing zone between fresh water and oceanic seawater [3] . Estuaries usually have high biological productivity due to nutrient input from terrestrial run-off [4] and the high food availability and low inter-specific competition may be a strong driving force for physiological adaptation to tolerate and perform well at intermediate salinities [5, 6] . Adaptation to diverging environments develops on intra-specific level either through adaptive phenotypic plasticity, that is, the ability of one genotype to produce multiple phenotypes in response to different ambient environments [7] , or through genetic adaptation [8, 9] . Such intra-specific differences in physiological performance can be crucial for species for maintaining high fitness in novel environments [8, 10] .",

                "text": "The European perch (Perca fluviatilis) is a freshwater fish native to the major part of Eurasia and, furthermore, has been introduced in parts of southern Europe, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand [11] [12] [13] . Although considered a stenohaline species, it also inhabits brackish waters in estuaries such as the Baltic Sea, one of the world's largest estuaries. European perch is an ecologically important predator with a significant top-down regulating effect on the environment it inhabits [14, 15] . However, its predatory lifestyle is a major issue in Australia, where it preys on endemic species and therefore is considered invasive [16] . In Europe, the species is popular for human consumption, and consequently a target for both a significant commercial and recreational fishery, as well as development in aquaculture rearing [12, 13, 17] . However, the abundance of European perch in the Baltic Sea has declined markedly in recent decades, probably owing to anthropogenic pollution of the environment [15, 18, 19] . A recent study showed that European perch originating from brackish water in the Baltic Sea had a markedly higher maximum salinity tolerance and an enhanced osmoregulatory capability compared to European perch originating from an inland freshwater lake, which has been supported by genetic divergence between the populations in these two habitats [17, 20] . However, it remains unknown whether this intra-specific difference in salinity tolerance and osmoregulatory capability translates into an alternated physiological performance that could be an ecological advantage for the species in estuaries. European perch thus constitutes an ideal candidate for studying intra-specific difference in the effect of salinity change on physiological performance and to evaluate its ecological importance.",

Although osmotic distress is presumably lowest where the ion and water gradients between the ambient water and the internal milieu approach zero, only some studies have shown critical swimming speed (Ucrit; the maximum prolonged swimming speed) to be highest in iso-osmotic water conditions, that is, at a salinity of around 10 [23,24,27] , while other studies have shown the highest Ucrit in either fresh or sea water or no effect of salinity on Ucrit at all [5, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Salinity change may also induce an energetic load through an added cost of osmoregulation. This should be apparent from the standard metabolic rate (SMR), that is, the temperature specific metabolic rate of a resting, non-digesting fish [33] , which should in theory be lowest in iso-osmotic conditions and increase at salinities departing from this level [31, [34] [35] [36] . Furthermore, the cost of osmoregulation may also depend on the activity level of the fish. Activity increases ventilatory flow to meet elevated oxygen demands, which enhances the potential for diffusion of water and ions over the gills, and, in turn, increases the energetic need for osmoregulation [34, 35, 37] . However, as for Ucrit, there is no consensus around near iso-osmotic conditions being favorable for the metabolism of fish, as studies have also shown that metabolic rates are not necessarily lowest at this level [38] . Neither is there agreement on the magnitude of the cost of osmoregulation, which varies from not measurable on SMR, to more than 30% of SMR. In addition, fish may also reduce the permeability of their gills to limit osmotic water movement and ion diffusion, at the cost of reducing respiratory gas exchange, a phenomenon known as the osmorespiratory compromise [39] . This may have energetic implications by reducing the maximum metabolic rate (MMR), that is, the highest achievable metabolic rate of a fish at a given temperature [40] . Both increased SMR and reduced MMR may reduce the aerobic scope, that is the magnitude by which an animal can increase its metabolic rate above that of SMR, in turn limiting the capacity for performing crucial activities in fish, such as swimming and digestion [41] .",

Such intra-specific difference has been shown in a variety of species, and is considered important for obtaining ecological compatibility, colonizing, and diversifying in habitats of different salinities [6, 20, 28, 29, 42, 43] . In the present study, we measured Ucrit and whole-animal metabolism by means of oxygen consumption rates (\u1e40O2), while swimming and at rest, at salinities of 0 and 10 in European perch. The fish originated from a low salinity tolerant population (LSTP) from a freshwater lake and from a high salinity tolerant population (HSTP) from a brackish water estuary [20] . It was hypothesized that iso-osmotic conditions (a salinity of 10) would be favorable for swimming performance due to lower osmotic gradient between the environment and internal milieu of the fish, and thus minimal osmotic distress. Furthermore, \u1e40O2 was expected to be highest in fresh water due to the cost of osmoregulation and that the cost of osmoregulation would increase with increasing swimming speed due to a higher potential for osmotic diffusion caused by increase in ventilation rate. In addition, we anticipated that HSTP would perform best along the salinity gradient, as the population has superior capabilities to cope with salinity changes.",

The salinity in this area is on average 10 [44] [45] [46] , but fluctuates considerably between 0 to 22 over time due to tides, stratification, patterns in river run-off, and periods of heavy winds, either forcing the high salinity water from Kattegat into the Baltic Sea or low salinity water from the Baltic Sea into Kattegat [47] [48] [49] . The fish were tagged with passive integrated transponders in the dorsal musculature to allow for identification, and were kept in 160 L aquaria, with four fish in each, at a water temperature of 20 \u00b0C. Before any acclimation or experimentation commenced, the fish were kept in fresh water (unchlorinated Elsinore tap water with a salinity of 0.4, henceforth rounded off to a salinity of 0) for three weeks to acclimate to the laboratory facilities and start eating. The fish were fed sliced herring twice a week. To maintain proper water quality, excess food was siphoned out, 60% of the water was renewed every week, and the water thoroughly aerated and continuously filtered through a trickle filter. To minimize stress, artificial seaweed and pipes were used as shelter structures and the light level kept low. The lighting period was 12 h light, 12 h dark.",

The experiments were conducted repeatedly on the same individuals at the two salinities. This approach was chosen to minimize inter-individual variation as the effects of salinity on physiological performance and metabolism may be subtle in fish [38, 50] . The fish were acutely transferred to the desired salinity, and subsequently acclimated for one month before being experimented on. After having gone through both experimental trials at the first salinity treatment, the fish were acutely transferred to the other salinity treatment and acclimated for another month before being experimented on again. To allow testing for carryover effects of the repeated measurement half of these individuals experienced the salinities in the order 0-10, the other half in the order 10-0. Brackish water was obtained by mixing tap water with filtered sea water from Oresund with a salinity of around 30. The salinity was checked daily with a handheld meter (WTW Multi 3410 conductivity meter, Xylem Analytics, Weilheim, Germany) and adjusted as necessary. The fish were fasted 5 days prior to experimentation, and their BM, TL, depth (D), and width (W) were measured before each experiment.",

At each salinity, the fish was first placed in a 11.8 L Steffensen Mk III swimming respirometer, set up as in [31] , at a swimming speed of 0.5 body length per second (BL s \u22121 ). The fish was left undisturbed overnight (between 15 and 20 h) to recover from handling and to acclimate to the respirometer. During the next day, the fish was subjected to a Ucrit swimming protocol [51] where the speed was increased with increments of 0.5 BL s \u22121 every 40 min until fatigue (Ucrit). Fatigue was determined as the point where the fish had rested against the rear grid of the swimming section in the respirometer for more than 10 s. \u1e40O2 was measured at each speed with a fiber optic oxygen sensor (Fibox 3, Presence Precision Sensing GmbH, Regensburg, Germany) by automated intermittent-flow respirometry, which allows for multiple and precise measurements of \u1e40O2 over long time series [52, 53] . Two \u1e40O2 measurements were taken for each speed. The flush time was 330 s to ensure a 95% water exchange between measurements, the wait time was 150 s to ensure proper mixing of the water in the respirometer before measurements, and the measuring time was 720 s to ensure a regression R 2 of >0.95 of the linear decrease in oxygen partial pressure per time. One background respiration (BR) measurement was taken after each trial at a water speed of 0.5 BL s \u22121 , without the presence of the fish. The BR measurement was taken immediately after removing the fish with a wait period of 300 s and a measuring time of 2400 s. The long measurement time for BR measurement was necessary to ensure a regression R 2 of above 0.95 due to low decrease in oxygen partial pressure per time [53] .",

On the contrary, we found that the LSTP reduced swimming performance at a salinity of 10. The decrease in Ucrit was apparently not associated with any of the measured energetic components: salinity stress did not impose a metabolic load on either SMR or \u1e40O2 during swimming, which would otherwise have implied an energetic cost of coping with salinity change and thus reduced the energy available for swimming, that is, the aerobic scope [41] , in turn restricting Ucrit. MMR was also not affected by salinity change, indicating a reduction in oxygen uptake to minimize osmotic water exchange and ion diffusion over the gill epithelium (an osmo-respiratory compromise) [39] , which would also have limited AS and hence Ucrit. However, the blood plasma osmolality of LSTP is known to increase between salinities of 0 and 10, while the blood plasma osmolality of HSTP remains unaffected by salinity in this range [20] . A change in internal osmotic pressure with changing salinity in LSTP could challenge regulation of muscle ion content and enzyme efficiency [63] , in turn affecting muscle functionality, leading the LSTP fish to fatigue earlier at elevated salinities.",

Near iso-osmotic water conditions are theoretically an energetic advantage for fish due to the added energetic cost of osmoregulation at salinities departing from this level, which could potentially explain high in situ growth rates of fish in estuaries, provide explanations for seasonal anadromous and catadromous migrations, and optimize growth of fish in aquaculture. However, in the present study, SMR and \u1e40O2 during swimming of European perch was not significantly higher in fresh water than in iso-osmotic water. We also found no evidence for the cost of osmoregulation to increase with increasing swimming speed, which we otherwise expected due to a higher potential for osmotic diffusion caused by increase in ventilation rate [31, 34, 35, 37] . These results are consistent with a multitude of other studies which also did not find an effect of salinity on whole-animal \u1e40O2 (reviewed in [38, 50] ), and suggests that the cost of osmoregulation is probably modest in teleost fish.",

We furthermore employed repeated measurements on the same individuals across the experimental salinities to reduce impacts from between-individual variation. A power analysis showed that the lowest detectable level of cost of osmoregulation in the present study was 10% of SMR, and the actual cost of osmoregulation in European perch is presumably lower than this. The estimated sample size needed to circumvent the issue of inter-individual variation and potentially detect the cost of osmoregulation, which is theoretically around 5% of SMR [59] [60] [61] , was extensive. In agreement with our analyses, a study on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) employing a sample size of 120 could not detect any difference in SMR between the iso-osmotic water and fresh or sea water [32] .",

For instance, a rise in cortisol level, at a level corresponding to the one associated with salinity change, induced increased \u1e40O2 in cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) parr [71] . Food intake and food conversion ration may also be affected by salinity [72] , and as metabolic rates are influenced by growth trajectory [73] , significant differences in \u1e40O2 between salinities may, in part, be caused by the nutritional condition of the fish. Although whole animal respirometry has been a widely applied to assess the cost of osmoregulation in fish [38, 50] , the many factors that potentially generate variance in \u1e40O2 determinations when measuring \u1e40O2 in relation to salinity change, combined with the presumably minor effect of salinity on \u1e40O2, render the methodology inappropriate for assessing the cost of osmoregulation compared to other approaches [59] [60] [61] .",

In monocle bream (Scolopsis bilineata), for instance, SMR determined by extrapolating \u1e40O2 in relation to swimming speed to a swimming speed of 0 was different from SMR determined in a static respirometer [74] . In Atlantic cod, MMR determined with swimming respirometry during a Ucrit trial was found to be lower than MMR with static respirometry after an exhaustion protocol (after the Ucrit trial and manually chased) [75, 76] . However, the opposite has been shown in the case of Atlantic salmon, where MMR was markedly higher when measured by means of swimming respirometry during a Ucrit trial than when MMR was measured with static respirometry after an exhaustion protocol [77] . Such differences arising from the respirometry method may yield different results across treatments in comparative studies. The respirometry method therefore needs to be taken into careful account when planning and conducting studies to produce reliable results. Metabolic rates have been extensively used to study the effect of perturbations of fish in the wild, such as fisheries, species invasion, climate change, and pollution [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] , and proven useful for predicting future distribution ranges of fish species and thereby aiding conservation [84] [85] [86] . In the present study, we found no differences in SMR and MMR of European perch when using swimming or static respirometry, and the species is thus a robust and ideal model organism for future studies on the response in metabolic rates of fish, for instance, in relation to climate change [38, 54, 87, 88] .",

European perch is a target for a substantial fishery in the Baltic Sea [12, 13, 46] , where their abundance has recently declined substantially [15, 18, 19] . Our findings of intra-specific differences in physiological performance in relation to salinity change therefore raises conservation concerns about the species in the area. Should extinction of local populations of European perch in the Baltic Sea occur, the results of the present study also show the importance of reintroducing fish from another estuarine population if re-establishment is to be successful [91] . This may not only apply to European perch, but also to Northern pike (Esox lucius), which is another ecologically and economically important freshwater fish species of the Baltic Sea that is currently declining in numbers in the area [15, 18, 19] . The present study is therefore important knowledge for ecologists, conservation biologists, and estuarine management.",

Grey circles represent \u1e40O2 before a critical swimming speed test, where \u1e40O2 is represented by open circles. (b) \u1e40O2 from the swimming respirometry trial in relation to U. A two-parameter exponential function was fitted to \u1e40O2 vs. U during the Ucrit test (solid line). Standard metabolic rate (SMR) was estimated by extrapolating this fit to a swimming speed of 0.0 BL s \u22121 and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) estimated by extrapolating the fit to the critical swimming speed (dashed lines). (c) \u1e40O2 of the fish over time in a static respirometer (open circles), where the solid line indicates SMR and the dashed line indicate MMR. (d) Histogram of the \u1e40O2 during the static respirometry trial (black columns; bins = 2 mgO2 kg \u22121 h \u22121 ). A double Gaussian distribution was fitted to the \u1e40O2 histogram (red line), sorting SMR determined into the distribution with the lowest mean value, and spontaneous activity into the other."

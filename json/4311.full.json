    "abstract": "Inherited loss of P/Q-type calcium channel function causes human absence epilepsy, episodic dyskinesia, and ataxia, but the molecular \"birthdate\" of the neurological syndrome and its dependence on prenatal pathophysiology is unknown. Since these channels mediate transmitter release at synapses throughout the brain and are expressed early in embryonic development, delineating the critical circuitry and onset underlying each of the emergent phenotypes requires targeted control of gene expression. To visualize P/Q-type Ca 2\u03e9 channels and dissect their role in neuronal networks at distinct developmental stages, we created a novel conditional Cacna1a knock-in mouse by inserting the floxed green fluorescent protein derivative Citrine into the first exon of Cacna1a and then crossed it with a postnatally expressing PCP2-Cre line for delayed Purkinje cell (PC) gene deletion within the cerebellum and sparsely in forebrain (purky). PCs in purky mice lacked P/Q-type calcium channel protein and currents within the first month after birth, displayed altered spontaneous firing, and showed impaired neurotransmission. Unexpectedly, adult purky mice exhibited the full spectrum of neurological deficits seen in mice with genomic Cacna1a ablation. Our results show that the ataxia, dyskinesia, and absence epilepsy caused by inherited disorders of the P/Q-type channel arise from signaling defects beginning in late infancy, revealing an early window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention.",

P/Q-type channels were first identified in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) (Llinas et al., 1989; Mintz et al., 1992a) and consist of a protein complex of pore-forming Cacna1A and auxiliary subunits (Catterall, 2000) . In PCs, somatodendritic P/Q-type channels are a major source of Ca 2\u03e9 transients and contribute to the firing and waveform of action potentials Hartmann and Konnerth, 2005) . At presynaptic sites, P/Q-type channels trigger the vesicular release of neurotransmitter (Dunlap et al., 1995; Catterall and Few, 2008) . P/Q-type channels share the release function with other Ca 2\u03e9 channels, including N and R type, with variable contributions to evoked transmitter release during development (e.g., early postnatal transmitter release can rely on a high contribution of N-type channels followed by a P/Q-type dominance in the second postnatal week), whereas at other synapses, N-type release remains dominant (Iwasaki et al., 2000) .",

Human ataxic phenotypes with cerebellar atrophy include SCA6 and EA2 (Kordasiewicz and Gomez, 2007; Strupp et al., 2007) . Mouse models show varying degrees of cerebellar pathology, from minimal dendritic atrophy and PC loss in tottering to more severe dystrophy in other alleles (Fletcher et al., 1996; Burgess and Noebels, 1999; Mori et al., 2000; Zwingman et al., 2001; Kodama et al., 2006; Sawada et al., 2009; Pietrobon, 2010) . Mutations in the auxiliary subunits Cacnb4 (lethargic) and Cacna2d2 (ducky) and targeted Cacna1adeficient mutants also show similar mild atrophic pathology (Fletcher and Frankel, 1999; Jun et al., 1999; Barclay et al., 2001; Fletcher et al., 2001; Brodbeck et al., 2002) . Along with the cerebellar atrophy and associated ataxia, Cacna1a mutations produce seemingly unrelated paroxysmal phenotypes appearing at distinct developmental stages (Pietrobon, 2010) . Absence seizures arising from aberrant oscillations in synaptically linked neocortex and reticular and thalamic relay circuits in mouse models appear as early as postnatal day 13 (P13) (Zhang et al., 2004) . Episodic dyskinesias have been linked to basal ganglia and cerebellar networks (Neychev et al., 2008) and, along with the ataxic gait, appear after 1 month of age.",

                "text": "Genomic DNA for construction of the conditional targeting vector was isolated from a RPCI-22 BAC library of 129 DNA in the Genome Resource Facility at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and verified by extensive Southern blot and sequence analyses. Ten RPCI-22 mouse BAC clones tested positive for the Cacna1a region of interest. The NheI restriction sites were used to isolate and directly subclone the 8 and 2 kb fragments into pcDNA3.1(\u03e9) (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Positive clones were detected by bacterial lifts with probes to exon 1 (8 kb) or intron 1 (2 kb) and verified by sequence analysis to the mouse genomic sequence reference NM_007578 (University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, Genomic Browser). The conditional targeting vector for Cacna1a was designed under the guidance and expertise of Dr. S. O'Gorman (O'Gorman et al., 1997) . Briefly, an 8 kb Cacna1a genomic DNA was subcloned into pSP72 backbone (Promega). Citrine (Heikal et al., 2000) , a third-generation yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) derivative, was flanked on the 5\u0408 end with a loxP and inserted in frame into a SacII site in exon 1. The floxed Citrine insertion is flanked by a 2 kb 5\u0408 untranslated region (short arm) and 6.5 kb intron 1 (long arm) region of homology. To ensure that the position of Citrine in Cacna1a does not disrupt the function or distribution of P/Q-type Ca 2\u03e9 channels, a YFP-labeled rat Cacna1a cDNA that is over 99% identical to the mouse cDNA in the N-terminal region (100% on protein level) was generated in the same position. Proper physiological function and membrane expression was demonstrated. In addition, a 1.8 kb genomic fragment containing exon 1, Citrine, and part of intron 1 was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. A fragment of \u03f365 kDa was produced in HEK293 cells and distributed in a punctate manner to the periphery of the cells. The neomycin gene [pOG277 (O'Gorman et al., 1997) ] flanked by loxP sites was inserted into a PvuII site in intron 1 for positive selection of targeted genes, and the HSV thymidine kinase gene [pNT-TK (Tybulewicz et al., 1991) ] was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pSP72 backbone (Promega) at HindIII site 5\u0408 to the short arm region of homology as a negative selection for improperly targeted genes. Intronic insertion of a neo gene may decrease levels of Cacna1a mRNA and cause premature splicing events. To avoid this problem, the neo cassette was inserted 800 bp downstream from the 5\u0408 end of intron 1 and flanked with loxP sites for subsequent deletion of the gene with Cre recombinase. After linearization of the conditional targeting vector with PvuI, the Transgene and Targeting Service at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH) targeted the Cacna1a-Citrine vector in embryonic stem (ES) cells containing the mouse protamine 1 promotor-Cre recombinase (PrmCre) trangenes (O'Gorman et al., 1997) . The Prm1 promoter restricts the expression of Cre to the haploid spermatids in mature mice, therefore reducing the number of electroporations and their time in culture, which increases the chances of ES cells of going germ line. Positively expressing ES cell lines were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Isolated genomic DNA from potential targeted ES cell lines were digested with BglII and probed with the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 external probe by Southern blot analyses (see Fig. 1 ). Successful homologously recombined targeting vectors produced a fragment at 7.5 kb and a WT fragment of 10.8 kb versus unsuccessful neo gene-alone recombinants at 12 kb. Positive ES clones were also confirmed by Southern blot analyses with a 3\u0408 internal probe after BglII digest for proper recombination of the long arm and by PCR and sequence analysis for successful recombination of the loxP sites, Citrine, and neomycin genes. Positive ES cell clones containing the Cacna1a-targeted gene were prepared and injected into blastocysts by the standard protocols of the Transgene and Targeting Service at Case Western Reserve University.",

Conditional Cacna1a Citrine mice were obtained by a series of matings. Briefly, male chimeras containing the targeted allele and the PrmCre transgene were initially mated with several WT females to generate four genetically different offsprings. Only the Cacna1a null(\u03e9/ \u03ea) and Cacna1a Citrine(\u03e9/ \u03ea) females also carrying the PrmCre were further mated with WT males to ensure the conservation of the conditional alleles (PrmCre recombinase activity occurs only in the male spermatids) and subsequent replacement of the PrmCre with a WT allele. Cacna1a null (\u03e9/ \u03ea) and Cacna1a Citrine(\u03e9/ \u03ea) mice not carrying the PrmCre gene were then crossed with each other to obtain complete knock-out mice (Cacna1a null( \u03ea/\u03ea) ) or homozygous knock-in mice (Cacna1a Citrine(\u03e9/\u03e9) ). Cacna1a Citrine mice were then further crossed with transgenic PC-specific CRE (Tg Pcp2-cre ) mice to create the purky mice (Cacna1a purky ). The genetic background of the mice was determined by PCR of genomic DNA from tail biopsy. To detect Citrine incorporation into the Cacna1 gene, PCRs were performed with primers to Cacna1a, Citrine, Cre recombinase, and Prm promoter.

Sagittal slices were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed, and incubated with the secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature to overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cells were embedded in Prolong Gold antifade (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and analyzed using VOLOCITY software (Improvision). For quantification of P/Q-type channel staining in cerebellar slices (see Fig. 4 ), images were acquired using the same settings on the LSM 510. Regions of interest (soma or dendrites) were selected, the average pixel intensity was measured, and the ratio between the red channel and the green channel was determined.",

For this study, three Cacna1a Citrine mice at P14, four Cacna1a Citrine mice at P23-P28, three Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice at P14 -P15, and five Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice at P17-P22 were used (gender not determined).

To examine the firing properties of PCs, we used extracellular recording methods as described previously (Edwards et al., 1989; Womack and Khodakhah, 2003) . Briefly, brains from three male mice per genotype were removed after decapitation and incubated immediately in ice-cold ACSF. The cerebellum was dissected, and sagittal slices (300 m) were cut on a VT1000S vibratome (Leica). Slices were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before recording and perfused with ACSF (pH 7.35; in mM: 128 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2.5 CaCl 2 , 1.2 MgSO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 1.23 NaH PO 4 and 10 D-glucose) equilibrated with 95% O and 5% CO 2 . To block excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input onto PCs, slices were perfused continuously with 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium (CNQX; 10 M; Tocris) and picrotoxin (100 M; Tocris). PC neurons were identified by their characteristic morphology using infrared optics. Experiments were performed at 35 \u03ee 0.5\u00b0C using a heated slice chamber in combination with a temperature controller (WPI). Extracellular recordings were analyzed with IgorPro. Spike detection, calculations of interspike intervals, and generation of interspike interval histograms were performed using a customized analysis protocol. The raw trace of each recording was first digitally filtered in Igor using a low-pass 1 kHz filter (FilterFIR; IgorPro) with the following parameters: the end of the pass band frequency was set to 0.02; the start of the reject band was set to 0.021; and the number of FilterFIR coefficients was set to 101. Spikes were then detected in the extracellular trace using an automated scanning protocol to detect a downward deflecting peak in each 5 s trace in 5 ms window steps. Downward deflecting peaks whose value exceeded the average value of the trace in each window by \u03fe200 V were defined as spikes. The interspike interval was then calculated by subtracting the difference between arrival times of the (i \u03e9 1)th and ith spikes. Histograms (128 bins) of the interspike intervals were then generated using the histogram analysis function within Igor. Bin width was set to 0.5 ms. Interspike intervals for cells with the trimodal pattern of activity were only analyzed during the tonic epoch of activity.",

                "text": "To study the distribution and function of P/Q-type channels in living mice, we engineered a conditional knock-in mouse model in which the P/Q-type channel can be visualized and deleted from a specific cell type. As indicated in Figure 1A , we inserted a GFP variant, Citrine (Heikal et al., 2000) , in frame within the first exon of the Cacna1a gene. This insert adds a Citrine tag to the Cacna1A subunit protein with a 12 amino acid linker on its amino terminal end representing the translation of an engineered loxP site. Two additional loxP sites flanking the neomycin gene are located within the first 1 kb of intron 1. The Citrine allows the visualization of the P/Q-type channel \u2423 1 subunit, whereas the loxP sites can be used to delete the expression of the P/Q-type channel protein using Cre recombinases. Before constructing the targeting vector, we verified that the insertion of the Citrine GFP variant at the corresponding N-terminal site in the rat and human recombinant P/Qtype channel does not interfere with the biophysical properties of the channel in HEK293 cells ( Fig. 1E-G ) (see also Hummer et al., 2003) . Neither the activation nor the inactivation properties were altered by the variant. Having established that the fluorescent protein does not interfere with P/Q-type current, we created the Cacna1a tm-Citrine\u03e9/\u03e9 mice using homologous recombination (see Materials and Methods). Briefly, the Cacna1a-Citrine vector was targeted in ES cells containing the mouse protamine 1 promotor-Cre recombinase (PrmCre) (O'Gorman et al., 1997) transgene. The PrmCre recombinase activity is restricted to haploid spermatids, which results in functional deletion of the P/Q-type channel in the first generation (Fig. 1A) . Deletion of the complete P/Q-type channel by the Prm1-Cre recombinase resulted in a null phenotype as described previously (Jun et al., 1999; Fletcher et al., 2001; Todorov et al., 2006) . These mice are smaller than WT mice, are ataxic, and develop severe seizures and die 3-4 weeks after birth (from now on called Cacna1a null( \u03ea/\u03ea) ) ( Fig. 1D ; supplemental Movie 1 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Functional deletion of the neomycin gene by PrmCre results in mice bearing a floxed Citrine P/Q-type channel knock-in (Cacna1a tm-Citrine\u03e9/\u03e9 ; from now on called Cacna1a Citrine ). These mice are viable, fertile, and indistinguishable from their WT littermates (supplemental Movie 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). To verify the correct distribution of the Citrine-tagged P/Q-type channel, we used Figure 1 . Creating Cacna1a Citrine mice. A, Design of the targeting vector to create Cacna1a Citrine mice. The WT gene with exon 1 (ex1) flanked by the 5\u0408 untranslated region (UTR), and intron 1 is depicted at the top, the targeting vector in the second line and the correctly targeted gene in the third line. An 8 kb Cacna1a fragment was subcloned into pSP72 backbone (Promega). Citrine gene (cit) flanked by a loxP site on the 5\u0408 end was subcloned into a SacII site in exon 1. Neomycin (neo) gene was subcloned into a PvuII site 800 bp downstream from the Citrine insertion in intron 1. Thymidine kinase (TK) gene was subcloned in a HindIII site in the pSP72 backbone. Male chimeras containing the targeted allele and the PrmCre transgene were mated with several WT females to generate four genetically different offspring: wild type, conditional null, Neo/null, and Citrine. Detection strategy of the conditional knock-in and knock-out mice by PCR after Cre recombinase excision by Protamine-CRE is shown in the schematic. B, Southern blot analyses for the detection of correctly targeted genes. Isolated genomic DNA from potentially targeted ES cell lines was digested with BglII and probed with the 5\u0408 external (lanes 1-3) or digested with KpnI and SpeI and probed with a 3\u0408 external (lanes 4 -6) probe. Lanes 1 and 4 are bands expected from WT ES cells, lanes 2 and 5 are bands expected from a positive clone G3, and lanes 3 and 6 are bands expected from a positive clone H5. Successful homologously recombined targeting vectors produced a fragment at 7.5 kb (lanes 2 and 3, top blot) and a WT fragment of 10.8 kb (lanes 1-3, top blot) with the 5\u0408 external probe and a 11.4 kb (lanes 5 and 6, bottom blot) and a WT fragment of 14.4 kb (lanes 4 -6, bottom blot) with the 3\u0408 external probe. C, PCR analysis and distinction between WT, Cacna1a Citrine , and Cacna1a null( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice. Depiction of PCR results from a WT, Cacna1a Citrine , and Cacna1a null( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice with three different primer combinations, specific for detecting the different mouse genotypes. D, Phenotypic differences between WT, Cacna1a Citrine , and Cacna1a null( \u03ea/\u03ea) . Whereas WT and Cacna1a Citrine reveal similar phenotypes, the Cacna1a null( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice develop severe seizures and die within 3-4 weeks after birth. E-G, N-terminally YFP-tagged Ca v 2.1 channels reveal the same biophysical properties as the untagged channels. The YFP tag was inserted into the conserved SacII site, which is the corresponding position in exon 1 of the mouse gene. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with either Ca v \u2423 1 2.1 (untagged) or Ca v \u2423 1 2. a GFP antibody to analyze various tissue and brain regions from Cacna1a tm-Citrine\u03e9/\u03ea female founder mice at 3 months of age where P/Q-type channels are typically expressed (i.e., cerebellum, hippocampus, pancreas, and neuromuscular junction) (Herlitze et al., 2003) . As shown in Figure 2 , the Citrine tag can be detected with the GFP antibody in all tissues analyzed and colocalizes with the endogenous P/Q-type channel. Thus, our results demonstrate that insertion of the floxed Citrine construct into the first exon of the Ca v 2.1 channel does not grossly interfere with the developmental function of the channel in vivo, allows for the visualization of native P/Q-type channels in brain sections using GFP antibodies, and permits conditional deletion of P/Q-type channels using the promotor-specific expression of Cre-recombinases.",

We analyzed the activity of PCs in acute cerebellar slices under conditions in which fast excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs were blocked with CNQX and picrotoxin. Extracellular recordings of PCs from Cacna1a Citrine mice revealed robust spontaneous activity at both P21 and P48 (n \u03ed 10 and 16, respectively) ( Fig.  5C,D) . As described previously in WT mice (Womack and Khodakhah, 2002; Walter et al., 2006) , PCs from Cacna1a Citrine mice fired either in a regular tonic pattern or in a trimodal pattern characterized by bursting, silent, and tonic activity (Fig. 5A) . The interspike interval of spontaneous tonic firing activity was 13 \u03ee 4 ms at P21 (n \u03ed 10) and 17 \u03ee 5 ms (n \u03ed 16) at P48 and was not statistically different from that observed in WT mice (Fig.  5B) . We found that 90% (n \u03ed 9 of 10) of PCs from P21 Cacna1a Citrine mice and 81% (n \u03ed 13 of 16) of PCs from P48 Cacna1a Citrine mice were spontaneously active (Fig. 5A) . In contrast, in P21 Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice, only 2 of 30 cells demonstrated spontaneous activity in cerebellar slice recordings (Fig.  5B,C) . At P48, we observed a complete loss of spontaneous activity as none of the PCs displayed AP firing even after 30 min of recording (n \u03ed 0 of 30) (Fig.  5B,D) . Thus, PCs from Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice lose their capacity to fire APs spontaneously in cerebellar slices between 3 and 7 weeks after birth. To evaluate whether the loss of P/Q-type channels in PCs affect the firing properties of cerebellar neurons in the living animal, we performed in vivo recordings in the PC layer of anesthetized mice (Fig. 5E ). We combined recordings of all neurons with simple spikes within the proximity of putative PCs (given by the electrode position), because of the difficulty in detecting complex spikes, and the decreased frequency and increased CV in Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice.

To determine whether P/Q-type channel reduction alters release at PC axon terminals, we analyzed the contribution of P/Q-type currents to evoked synaptic transmission in the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN). Evoked GABAergic IPSCs were recorded in DCN neurons. We found that IPSCs were completely blocked by application of AgaIVA in Cacna1a Citrine cerebellar slices (Fig. 6A,C) . In contrast, AgaIVA did block synaptic transmission only by \u03fd10% in Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice. However, IPSCs were reduced by \u03f360% after application of the N-type channel blocker CtxGVIA (Fig. 6B,D) . IPSCs were completely blocked by the GABA A receptor antagonist Gabazine (10 M; data not shown). The loss of P/Q-type channels at the presynaptic terminal was correlated with a fivefold reduction in the evoked IPSC size. Averaged IPSC amplitude was 2.53 \u03ee 0.38 nA (n \u03ed 7) in Cacna1a Citrine mice and 0.47 \u03ee 0.1 nA (n \u03ed 6) in the Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice 2-3 weeks of age. These results suggest that synaptic transmission at PC terminals of Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice in the DCN is reduced but persists in the absence of P/Q-type channels, relying mainly on N-type channel-mediated exocytosis.",

Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice develop a mild to severe ataxic gait after 2 weeks of age. The ataxia can be easily visualized in a footprint assay of spontaneous gait that demonstrates a difference in stride length and forelimb/hindlimb overlap (print positions) of 3-month-old Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice compared with their Cacna1a Citrine littermates (Table 1 ). To quantify their motor deficit, we performed additional tests, including the rotarod, vertical pole, inclined screen, grip strength, and Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) evaluation with 3-to 6-month-old mice. Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice performed extremely poorly on the rotarod test. While Cacna1a Citrine control mice were able to stay on the rotorod for an average of 100 s at a turning speed of up to 14 rpm and improved their performance during a 3 d trial period to 160 s at a final turning speed of 20 rpm, littermate Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice fell off the rod after 20 s at a turning rate of 5 rpm and did not improve their performance during the 3 d trial period (Fig.  7B) . Similar deficits were observed on the inclined screen ( Fig.  7C ) and vertical pole (Fig. 7D) tests. Cacna1a Citrine mice needed 27 and 32 s, respectively, for a 60\u00b0and a 90\u00b0incline, whereas the PC P/Q-type channel knock-down mice needed approximately twice that time to reach the platform (Fig. 7C) .",

The Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice received a BMS score of 5.5, consistent with frequent plantar stepping and some coordination between the forelimb and the hindlimb step (Fig. 7F ). Although stride length between forelimb and hindlimb was reduced, Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) were still able to move with a consistent speed and distance as seen in the footprints (Fig. 7A and Table 1 ). To determine whether the loss of P/Q-type channels in PCs also reduced coordinated motor strength, we performed a grip strength assay and detected differences in the forepaws but not hindpaws (Fig. 7E ). This may partially reflect a fine motor grasp deficit rather than a difference in muscle strength, since Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice had difficulties coordinating their forepaw grip.",

                "text": "As early as 3 weeks after birth, Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice develop spontaneous episodes of paroxysmal dyskinesia ( Fig. 8 A and Table 2 ; supplemental Movie 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). These unprovoked events consist of sustained axial dystonia and repetitive clonic limb movements without changes in the cortical EEG as described in the tottering and leaner alleles of mice with spontaneous Cacna1a mutations (Noebels and Sidman, 1979; Khan and Jinnah, 2002) . The mean frequency of spontaneous dystonic attacks within a 24 h period was 2.3 \u03ee 4.1 (n \u03ed 18), and the episodes showed a typical duration of about 40 min. These dyskinesias could also be induced in adult mice (3-18 months old) by stress or chemicals, such as a new environment, cage transport, short restraint, or administration of caffeine and alcohol (Table 2) . Finally, to fully evaluate the phenotypic triad characteristic of P/Q-type loss of function, we looked for generalized, nonconvulsive spike-wave neocortical discharges by performing prolonged video EEG monitoring in awake, behaving mutant mice at 1-4 months of age. Surprisingly, we found that the purky mice show stereotyped 6 -7 spikes/s generalized spike-wave seizure discharges accompanied by behavioral arrest identical to those in genomic Cacna1a mutants (Fig. 8 B) , despite the lack of obvious differences in the distribution of P/Q-type channels in thalamic relay or parvalbumin-positive reticular neurons between Cacna1a Citrine and Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice (Fig. 8C) . This pattern of seizure activity has long been considered to reflect alterations in the interplay between neurons in neocortex, reticular, and thalamic relay nuclei. We therefore analyzed P/Q-type channelmediated GABAergic synaptic transmission at the nucleus reticularis of the thalamus (nRT). These neurons send inhibitory projections into the thalamic relay cells and undergo a developmental shift between N-type and P/Q-type channels between P10 and P19 (Iwasaki et al., 2000) . We recorded the GABAergic IPSCs from thalamocortical relay neurons in the laterodorsal thalamic nucleus after stimulation of the nRT. We found that at P19 -P21, synaptic transmitter release is uniformly and almost completely blocked by the P/Q-type channel blocker AgaIVA in Cacna1a Citrine mice (91.5 \u03ee 3.7%; n \u03ed 7) (Fig. 8 E) . In contrast, in Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice we found a high degree of variability in P/Q-type channel-dependent IPSCs, ranging from 10 to 80% (32.9 \u03ee 9.2%; n \u03ed 7) suggesting a \"leaky\" partial deletion of Cacna1a in nRT (Fig. 8 F) . There was no significant change in the amplitude of evoked IPSCs (Cacna1a Citrine : 3.46 \u03ee 0.53 nA; n \u03ed 7) and Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) : 2.17 \u03ee 0.57 nA; n \u03ed 7). To determine whether these results could be explained by either an alteration in cerebellar output regulating the development of thalamocortical projections or a small residual expression of Cre recombinase in GABAergic interneurons driven by the PCP2 Cre promoter, leading to the deletion of the P/Q-type channel outside of the cerebellum, we compared the P/Q-type channel protein levels of the adult forebrain. We found that the protein level in Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice is reduced by 16% compared with Cacna1a Citrine mice (84 \u03ee 9%; n \u03ed 5) (Fig. 8 D) . This result suggests that a sparse expression of Cre recombinase in the PCP2-Cre mouse line within the thalamus and probably elsewhere in the brain can likely account for the abnormal thalamocortical signaling in purky mice.",

We tagged the channel in the first exon of the Cacna1a gene and flanked the Citrine with loxP sites for the Cre-recombinase-mediated excision of exon 1. The endogenous GFP-tagged channel retains WT function in cerebellar PCs, as evidenced by unaltered cellular firing properties and the lack of a neurobehavioral phenotype in these mice. To reduce the number of electroporations and time in culture, we introduced our Cacna1a-Citrine targeting vector into ES cells containing PrmCre, allowing knock-in of a floxed Citrine of Cacna1a in the first generation of mice. The phenotype of these PrmCre-mediated knock-out mice resembled other P/Q-type channel mutations where exon 3 was deleted (Jun et al., 1999; Fletcher et al., 2001; Todorov et al., 2006) . This new construct should prove valuable in future genotype-phenotype analyses aimed at dissecting the role of Cav2.1 function in a variety of Cre-expressing lines targeting specific CNS networks.",

The very weak immunofluorescence detected in older animals is likely caused by nonspecific background staining; however, we cannot exclude that a low level of P/Q-type channel remains. We saw no obvious changes in PC number from Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice at 3 month of age; however, the cerebellar cortical molecular layer appears abnormally thin when compared with Cacna1a Citrine mice. A careful investigation of changes in PC number and dendritic morphology will be needed to reveal how Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice compare with other ataxic P/Q-type Ca 2\u03e9 channel mouse models (Rhyu et al., 1999a,b; Hoebeek et al., 2008) .",

Our results agree with previous studies showing that inhibition of VGCCs and/or P/Q-type channels blocks spontaneous activity and is important for PC firing (Swensen and Bean, 2003; Khaliq and Raman, 2006; Levin et al., 2006) . P/Q-type channels in PCs are coupled to Ca 2\u03e9 -activated K \u03e9 channels , which also regulate intrinsic repetitive AP firing properties (Llinas and Sugimori, 1980a,b; Tank et al., 1988; Walter et al., 2006) . Additionally, we found reduced firing frequency and increased CV of cerebellar neurons in purky mice. A decrease in the precision of PC firing has also been detected in other P/Q mutant alleles, such as ducky, leaner, and tottering, and has been suggested to contribute to the ataxic phenotype (Hoebeek et al., 2005; Walter et al., 2006) . We also observed low-frequency oscillations in some cerebellar neurons from purky (data not shown) as described recently in tottering (Chen et al., 2009) . We analyzed the functional consequences of PC-specific loss of P/Q-type channels at the presynaptic terminal and found that after 3 weeks of age, severely ataxic mice completely lost most of their sensitivity to the P/Qtype channel blocker AgaIVA, which correlated with a reduction in IPSC amplitude. The remaining synaptic transmission relies mainly on N-type channels. A similar finding has been reported at central synapses in tottering mice (Qian and Noebels, 2000; Inchauspe et al., 2007) .",

                "text": "an impairment of central motor pathways beginning in embryonic development, an early signaling defect coinciding with postnatal cerebellar development, or a dysfunction that commences once cerebellar development is essentially complete during the juvenile period. We found that delaying the ablation of P/Q-type channels until the second postnatal week produced a deficit in cerebellar function comparable to those seen in inherited models of Cacna1a deficiency. In addition, the delayed loss of P/Q-type channels in PCs results in similar episodes of dyskinesia (supplemental Video 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Identical episodes of dyskinesia (paroxysmal dystonia with clonic limb shaking) are also observed in other P/Q-type channel loss-of-function mutants such as tottering, ducky, and lethargic (Noebels and Sidman, 1979) , and their exact neural mechanism is unknown (Fletcher et al., 1996; Burgess et al., 1997; Fletcher and Frankel, 1999; Barclay et al., 2001; Khan and Jinnah, 2002; Pietrobon, 2005) . Cerebellar pathways are involved (Pizoli et al., 2002) , and the episodes are eliminated when PCs are genetically removed (Campbell et al., 1999) ; however, their dependence on normal PC signaling patterns has not been previously demonstrated. An unexpected phenotype in Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice was the appearance of generalized absence epilepsy, since the brain regions considered critical for the generation of thalamocortical absence seizures include the sensorimotor areas of the neocortex and associated reticular and thalamic relay nuclei but not cerebellar circuitry (Steriade and Llinas, 1988; Buzsaki, 1991; Timofeev and Steriade, 2004; Meeren et al., 2005) . We considered several possible explanations for this thalamocortical network excitability phenotype in purky mice. First, since small changes in GABAergic transmission have been shown sufficient to induce abnormal discharges in thalamocortical networks (Sohal and Huguenard, 2003) , one possibility is that the spike-wave discharges reflect slight defects in forebrain inhibitory network synchronization because of leakage of the PCP2/L7 promoter, impairing release at a small population of critical synapses in neocortex and thalamus (Barski et al., 2000) . In agreement with this, we found a change in the P/Q-type channel dependence of GABAergic transmitter release in inhibitory interneurons and a 16% reduction in forebrain P/Q-type channel protein levels. The results suggest that residual nonspecific Cre activity outside the cerebellar PCs reduces forebrain P/Q-type channels, consistent with a recent finding that other transgenic PCP2-Cre-driver lines reveal scattered Cre-mediated dtTomato expression in the forebrain (Madisen et al., 2010) . However, it remains surprising that the synchronization phenotype can arise from this small reduction in P/Q-type channels, since mice heterozygous for tottering, lethargic, and ducky mutations, as well as juvenile mice haploinsufficient for the Cacna1a locus that lack 50% of the normal population of P/Q-type channels, are phenotypically normal without evidence of cortical discharges (Pietrobon, 2010) . An additional possibility is that normal oscillatory patterns in thalamocortical circuitry could depend on early cerebellar input to thalamic nuclei. The decreased output of PCs in purky mice reduces inhibition of neurons in deep cerebellar nuclei; if this disinhibition increases the output of the cerebellar projection to the thalamus, it could contribute to a developmental alteration in firing properties in adult thalamocortical circuitry contributing to the epileptic phenotype, including changes in T-type Ca 2\u03e9 current densities in thalamic neurons or plasticity changes within excitatory or inhibitory neurons in the thalamocortical network. These mechanisms could be induced indirectly by changes in the thalamic input via abnormal cerebellar output activity patterns or directly via sparse, random loss of the P/Q-type channel within the thalamocortical circuit itself.",

A, Nine-month-old male Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mouse during an episode of motor dyskinesia. The picture was taken from supplemental Movie 4 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and illustrates the typical exaggerated truncal posture with forepaw clonus. B, Spontaneous bilateral generalized 6 -7 s spike discharge in cortical EEG recording from left (L) and right (R) hemispheres accompanied by behavioral arrest in an awake Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mutant. Abnormal discharges were never observed in control Cacna1a Citrine mice. Calibration: 1 s, 300 V. C, Comparison of P/Q-type channel staining (green) in parvalbumin-positive neurons (red) showing similar evidence of P/Q-type expression in thalamic neurons of 6-week-old Cacna1a Citrine and Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice. Scale bar, 40 m. D, Right, Western blot analysis of forebrain homogenates from adult Cacna1a Citrine and Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mouse brains. Left, Relative protein expression of Cacna1A and \u2424-actin as a loading control was determined. E, F, Alteration of P/Q-type channel contribution for synaptic transmission from GABAergic interneuron to thalamic nuclei neurons in Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) mice compared with Cacna1a Citrine mice. Left, Time course of inhibition of IPSC by Ca 2\u03e9 channel blockers recorded in LD thalamic nucleus neurons of Cacna1a Citrine (E) and Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) (F) mice. A total of 0.2 M AgaIVA and subsequently 1 M CtxGVIA were applied. Middle, Example traces of IPSCs before and after application of the indicated Ca 2\u03e9 channel blockers for Cacna1a Citrine (E) and Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) (F) mice. Right, Plots showing the remaining fraction of IPSCs after blocked by the indicated blockers for Cacna1a Citrine (E) and Cacna1a purk( \u03ea/\u03ea) (F) mice. Plots are connected for the same cells. The number in parentheses indicates the number of experiments.",

As calcium is involved in many important metabolic activities, in this study, we cloned the calmodulin-like protein (CaLP) gene of one of the scleractinian corals, Galaxea astreata. We also detected the relative mRNA expression levels of gaCaLP using the calcium channel blocker verapamil and CaCl 2 treatment under conditions of light and dark, and compared expression levels under controlled temperature conditions. Full-length gaCaLP cDNA comprised 1290 nucleotides and contained 498 bp open reading frame that encoded a protein with 165 amino acids. With CaCl 2 , expression levels of gaCaLP only increased in the presence of light, suggesting that light may be a restrictive factor in CaLP expression when sufficient calcium is available in the environment. In addition, after verapami treatment, we noted that a down regulation of gaCaLP, suggesting that the expression of CaLP is closely related to extracellular Ca 2+ influx. Under temperature stress at both high (30\u00b0C) and low (20\u00b0C) temperatures, expression levels of gaCaLP showed an initial increase, followed by a decreasing trend as treatment progressed. Expression levels reached their maximum value at 24 h. This result showed that CaLP participated in a temperature stress response, and Ca 2+ homeostasis was disrupted during stress.

The formation of biomineralized structures, which are products of Ca 2+ metabolism, is controlled by biochemical and physiological activities and many Ca 2+ -binding proteins are involved, such as calmodulin (CaM) and calmodulin-like protein (CaLP), which have EF-hand domains for calcium binding. The EF-hands are characterized by a helix-loop-helix structure, and are closed in the absence of Ca 2+ ; the Ca 2+ -free form of the EF-hand protein is not active (Chen et al. 2015) . In calcium signal transduction, calcium triggers CaM and CaLP conformational changes, which result in activity changes and allow interaction with downstream proteins (Maki et al. 2002) .",

                "text": "Calmodulin-like protein (CaLP), a multi-functional calcium-sensing element that belongs to the CaM superfamily, has already been studied in nematodes (Karabinos 2016) , fruit fly (Fyrberg et al. 1994) , rats (Tomizawa et al. 1993) , and humans (Hashimoto et al. 2017) . CaLP is involved in human epithelial cell differentiation (Me'hul et al. 2000) , and the regulation of Ca 2+ -induced release of Ca 2+ in human and rat cell lines (Kasri et al. 2003) . In addition, it has been shown to be modulated by elevated pCO exposure in bivalves (Jeffrey et al. 2017) . Compared with CaM, CaLP had a greater role and more research significance in calcified organisms. For example, it has the maximal expressed levels in scallop Chlamys farreri mantle, a key organ involved in shell formation, whereas CaM expression levels are basically similar in each organization (Lin et al. 2014) . Moreover, its expression increased more in the shell notching experiment in C. farreri and shell Yuanjia Huang and Jigui Yuan contributed to the work equally and should be regarded as co-first authors. regeneration in Pinctad fucata than that of CaM, thereby suggesting that CaLP participated in biomineralization (Lin et al. 2014; Fang et al. 2008) . Among highly calcified organisms, coral calcification results in the formation of approximately 284,300 km of coral reefs (Spalding et al. 2001) , which are formed through enriched bonding of Ca 2+ , C, and O atoms in the ectoderm (Geng et al. 2017) . Corals are temperaturesensitive organisms; in fact, 20\u00b0C is the minimum seawater temperature for scleractinian coral growth and 30\u00b0C is the maximum temperature for mass propagation (Zhu 1987) . Regrettably, high sea water temperature has already caused major coral bleaching events (De'ath et al. 2012) . Huang et al. (1998) showed that intracellular Ca 2+ sustained increases in isolated coral cells over 24 h of thermal stress. Given that calcium signaling is closely connected to exocytosis, some studies have pointed out that one of the relationships between calcium signaling and bleaching can be explained by zooxanthellae exocytosis triggered by increasing intracellular Ca 2+ concentration (Fang et al. 1997) . Since CaLP has an important role in the calcium signaling pathway, temperature stress also affects CaLP expression. In a previous study, our transcriptome data (unpublished) revealed that Galaxea astreata CaLP was up-regulated after 12 h in 35\u00b0C. However, this temperature was too high to conform with real conditions, and a moderate temperature treatment was needed to obtain more meaningful data.",

                "text": "Light provides a primary source of energy for coral reefs and accelerates CaCO skeleton precipitation in scleractinian corals, which is called light-enhanced calcification. This positive correlation between light and coral calcification has been observed in both laboratory and field studies. For example, Moya et al. (2006) reported that coral calcification rates in Acropora spp. showed a 2.6-fold enhancement at 12 AM compared with that observed at 12 PM. In Acropora horrida and Porites cylindrical, light caused significant changes in calcification rates by measuring related indexes after nubbins were incubated for approximately 4 h (Suggett et al. 2013) . Higher coral calcification rates also mean higher calcium uptake rates. In a study of calcium incorporation, calcium uptake was through calcium channels, thereby suggesting the involvement of verapamil-sensitive Ca 2+ channels in some marine invertebrates, such as crustaceans, echinoids and corals, based on pharmacological evidence (Zoccola et al. 1999) . Tambutt\u00e9 et al. (1996) studied the transcellular passage of Ca 2+ in Stylophora pistillata by using verapamil. In addition, CaCl was also studied in coral Ca 2+ incorporation (Al-Horani et al. 2005) . Using verapamil and CaCl to study calcium-sensing elements in both light and dark conditions can better elucidate the molecular mechanism of coral calcium uptake.",

This was one of the most abundant coral species in Xuwen Coral Reef National Nature Reserve (Shen et al. 2016) . However, coral coverage rate in Xuwen rapidly declined because of human activities and other environmental factors, thereby resulting in a corresponding decline of G. astreata. It is therefore necessary to understand the physiological and stress tolerance molecular mechanism in G. astreata. To this end, we cloned and characterized the full-length CaLP cDNA of G. astreata and conducted a transcript expression analysis in CaCl 2 and verapamil culture under light and dark conditions respectively, and at varying times after hot (30\u00b0C) and cold (20\u00b0C) treatments.",

Our study found that gaCaLP expression level was reduced in the treatment of verapamil under both light and dark conditions, suggesting that CaLP expression was affected by extracellular calcium influx. In C. farreri (Lin et al. 2014) and Hyriopsis cumingii (Ren et al. 2013) , CaLP expression increased with the increase of the concentration of Ca 2+ in the environment within a certain range. This result was consistent with the role of CaLP as a key calcium sensor, storage, and trafficking protein.",

The stress protein was highly expressed at the beginning of the stress conditions, and protein synthesis decreased due to heat tolerance or to the gradual decrease in energy supply. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), observed under heat stress, also have a similar expression pattern (Carpenter et al. 2010) . Li et al. (2004) reported that the expression of HSP70 in heat stress is regulated by CaM. Since the structure and function of CaLP have high similarity with CaM, the reaction mechanism of CaLP after heat stress may also be consistent with CaM. In addition, CaLP expression changes provided evidence of disruption of Ca 2+ homeostasis during temperature stress. Ca 2+ homeostasis disruption was observed during thermal stress experiments on Caribbean coral Montastraea faveolata for 10 days and 17 h, which was demonstrated by down regulation of CaM and an EF-hand protein (Desalvo et al. 2008) . A previous study also showed intracellular calcium concentrations sustained increases under heat treatment over 24 h (Huang et al. 1998 ). This same trend was observed in our experiments. Compared with thermal stress, cold stress also generated remarkable fluctuation in gaCaLP expression. CaLP belonged to a member of the CaM superfamily. Earlier studies have shown that cold can lead to CaM expression increase in fish, and over expression experiments on tobacco showed that CaM enhances plant cold resistance (Yang et al. 2013) . Under cold stimuli, membrane depolarization was generated by an increase in the Ca 2+ conductance and a decrease in the K + conductance (Kuriu et al. 1997) . Previous studies also showed that some calcium channels were activated in cold temperatures and cold-induced Ca 2+ increase in cytosol (Yang et al. 2013) . However, how CaLP participates in temperature stress response requires further study.",

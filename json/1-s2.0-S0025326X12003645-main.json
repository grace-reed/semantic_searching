More data on OA impacts on calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) shell forming organisms (called ''calcifiers'') are urgently needed because OA could exert deleterious effects not only on organism's ability to make their shells but also on their metabolism and physiology (Fabry et al., 2008) . Global mean ocean pH has already decreased 0.1 units because of OA, and is predicted to drop by 0.7 units before 2300 under the IPCC's worst case scenario for CO 2 emissions (Zeebe et al., 2008) . This excess H [+] combines with carbonate ions to form bicarbonates. The carbonate ions that are in depletion this way concurrently reduces the saturation state of all forms of CaCO 3 minerals, which makes marine organisms harder to form their shells and/or even trigger their shells to dissolve (Feely et al., 2009) . Due to OA, southern oceans are already corrosive to shells of many invertebrates, making them harder to form their shells or even have their shell dissolved (Fabry et al., 2009) . This OA effect is gradually spreading into tropical seas (Kleypas et al., 1999) .",

This newly hatched larva feeds on micro-algae, develops into advanced larval stage, called pediveliger, and finally enters into benthic life by attaching on hard substrates (Collet et al., 1999) . Although this pelagic life aids them to disperse and colonize diverse habitats, it is achieved only at an extremely high cost (Thiyagarajan, 2010) . Generally, >90% of larvae dies before they reach attachment stage due to predation and environmental stress (Jessopp, 2007) . Thus early larval life stages are not only highly susceptible to stressors; their physiological fitness would also determine the success of pre-and post-larval life (Pechenik, 1999) . When analyzing the effects of OA on shellfishes, it is thus critical to study their effects not only on adult stage but also on larval stages (Dupont et al., 2008; Gazeau et al., 2010; Kurihara et al., 2007; Talmage and Gobler, 2010) . The larvae of oysters are particularly at risk because they use aragonite (MgCO 3 ) in their shell, which is 30 times more sensitive to OA than normal calcite (CaCO ) based adult shells (Medakovi\u00e9 et al., 1989) .",

These symptoms could most probably be due to the down-regulation of genes responsible for calcification, and energy metabolism (Todgham and Hofmann, 2009) . Expression of gene (s) does not always correlate with their product (protein) (s) (G\u00f6rg et al., 2004) . Therefore, knowledge of protein expression pattern is necessary to understand the direct link between OA stress and larval physiological response (Hofmann et al., 2008) . However, differential expression of proteins (proteome plasticity), especially in early larval life stages, in response to OA has not yet been well explored (Wong et al., 2011) . Recently, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) based proteomics has emerged to be a highly useful tool to study global protein expression pattern in a variety of non-model larval species (Thiyagarajan and Qian, 2008; Wong et al., 2011) . Using similar larval proteomic approach, in this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the negative effects of OA on early larval stage (e.g. decreased shell growth) are mediated through differential expression of proteins associated with calcification, metabolism, and stress tolerance. We also explored the role of protein expression variation in acclimation to OA. To accomplish our objectives, (1) embryos of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) were cultured at high (OA) and ambient CO (control) conditions for 6 days, and (2) larvae of similar physiological age and shell size (on Day 4) from the OA and the control groups were analyzed by 2dimentional electrophoresis (2-DE), and selected (differentially expressed) proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).",

Through air and CO 2 gas flow adjustment system, a steady-state carbonate system was reached and maintained, i.e. pH $8.0 for control and pH $7.5 for OA treatment using gas flow rotameters (Cole-Parmer, USA). This decreased pH 7.5 and concomitant increase in the partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2 ) $2275 latm ultimately resulted in under saturation of aragonite in OA treatment tanks. This high amount of pCO 2 was required in our system to reduce pH from 8.0 to 7.5 because of relatively high total alkalinity (TA) in ambient water (1977 \u00b1 29) . Two of the carbonate system parameters, pH (NBS scale) and total alkalinity, were measured according to the standard protocols (Dickson et al., 2007) . Titration alkalinity measured data were verified using measurements obtained from seawater reference materials (Batch 103, A.G. Dickson, Scripps Institution of Oceanography). Then, the whole carbonate system was calculated using the program co2sys.xls spreadsheet (Pelletier et al., 2005) by inputting pH, alkalinity, temperature and salinity and by using standard dissociation constants (Dickson and Millero, 1987) .",

By using these standard protocols, carbonate system variables such as pH, pCO 2 , CO 2\u00c0 3 ion concentration, and CaCO 3 mineral saturation levels were maintained at significantly different levels between the control and the OA treatment. In this study, when the pH reduced from 7.92 (\u00b10.02, control) to 7.48 (\u00b10.01, OA treatment) by bubbling with high-CO air, the pCO 2 increased 3 times (to 2273 \u00b1 349) and CaCO minerals became under saturated (X aragonite = 0.6 \u00b1 0.02; X calcite = 0.9 \u00b1 0.03). There was no significant change in total alkalinity between the control and the OA treatment. Although the pH or pCO levels chosen in this study are expected only in the year 2300 or beyond (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003) , this slightly extreme perturbation level is invaluable to understand OA effects at both physiological and molecular levels (Hale et al., 2011; Melzner et al., 2009; Widdicombe and Spicer, 2008) . Nevertheless, the perturbated carbonate system in a 450 L OA treatment tanks allowed us (1) to maintain a highly stable carbonate system (compared to small-scale culture containers, authors unpublished data), (2) to perform the OA experiment using typical oyster hatchery procedures such as water change and larval filtration and feeding strategies as described in typical hatchery manual (Breese and Malouf, 1975) , (3) to obtain enough larval samples for proteomics analysis and finally, (4) to extrapo-late obtained results to commercial oyster hatchery conditions. To our knowledge this is the first study to use such large volume cultures to examine OA effect on oyster larvae (but see (Gazeau et al., 2010) . However, this experimental design and scale was not suitable and not aimed to determine the effects of OA on embryo or larval developmental and success rates.",

However, there were significant difference in shell size between the control and the OA treatment groups on Day 6. It appears that larval physiology that is required for normal shell growth (e.g. calcification) seem to be hindered by OA only from Day 4. Therefore, the Day 4 larvae with similar shell size or developmental stage between the control and the OA treatment were used for proteomic analysis. This similarly sized sample between the control and treatment groups were necessary for us to determine the potential impact of OA on larval proteome without interference of other co-variables such as delayed growth due to OA effect (Sam Dupont, personal communication). On Day 6, for example, larvae from OA group were significantly smaller in shell size though they were at same age of control group. This issue of larval age and size in molecular OA studies has recently been discussed as ''virtual age'' (Dupont et al., 2010) .",

It appears that OA effects are highly species-specific in oysters. For instance, a slight drop in pH (0.3 units from ambient level) hindered larval shell growth in the Suminoe oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis) but not in the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) (Miller et al., 2009) . Among various carbonate system (OA) parameters, only the carbonate ion concentration appears to be detrimental to early larval life stages of oysters (Gazeau et al., 2011) . Oyster embryos and early life stages of some species do not appear to have an efficient calcification compensatory mechanism to overcome OA effects especially when the carbonate ion concentration goes below the saturation level. This might explain the observed negative effects of OA on Pacific oyster early life stages. The negative effects of a delayed and/ or impaired early larval development under OA conditions on oyster production at hatchery and fishery scale have been highlighted in various recent literatures (Havenhand and Schlegel, 2009; Miller et al., 2009; Parker et al., 2009; Talmage and Gobler, 2009; Waldbusser et al., 2011; Watson et al., 2009) .",

To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of oyster larval proteome using 2-DE approach. Generally marine invertebrate larvae tend to have this range of numbers of soluble (in lysis buffer) proteins that can be resolved using conventional 2-DE approach, i.e. there were about 350 in corals (Deboer et al., 2007) , 250-500 in polychaete tubeworm (Zhang et al., 2010) , 400 in barnacles (Thiyagarajan and Qian, 2008) and 450 in mussels (L\u00f3pez et al., 2005) . However, larval proteome structure (i.e. distribution of proteins according to their pI and MW) is highly species specific. For instance, majority of proteins in the larvae of tube-worm, Hydroides elegans, was visualized in acidic region of the gel (pI 3-6) and were of low-molecular weight (ranged between 50 and 10 kDa) (Zhang et al., 2010) . On the other hand, results from the current study showed that oyster larval proteins lie between pI 4-8 and spread between MW 100 and 10 kDa (Fig. 2) .",

Similarities in the global expression pattern of replicate gels in both groups were estimated with a TMEV heat map that resulted from hierarchical clustering analysis of normalized protein spot volume data of all the 6 samples. The proteome or samples were clearly grouped in two well-differentiated clusters, the control and the OA treatment (Fig. 3) . Subsequent statistical analysis also revealed dramatic OA dependent changes in several protein spots. Surprisingly, large numbers of low-MW proteins (<40 kDa) completely down-regulated after OA exposure (see Fig. 2B in comparison with Fig. 2A ). Such massive down-regulation may be associated with larval metabolic depression in response to OA. There are many strategies that marine organism may employ to tolerate OA stress, and one of which could involve metabolic depression (Hofmann and Todgham, 2010) . For instance, oysters tend to reduce their overall metabolic activity and energy metabolism in response to OA stress (Lannig et al., 2010) . In larval sea urchin, expression of many genes in the biomineralization, metabolic, cellular stress and apoptotic pathways were down-regulated in response to OA (O'Donnell et al., 2010; Todgham and Hofmann, 2009) . Therefore one would expect a down-regulation of a large numbers of proteins in response to OA to conserve energy as part of one of the compensatory responses (Wood et al., 2008) . Our results provide preliminary evidence to support the above hypothesis.",

In the mantle tissues of an eastern oyster, expressions of only 12% of their total 456 proteins have been altered by OA (Tomanek et al., 2011) . Similarly, only 9 of the total 566 proteins in the intertidal barnacle larvae (Balanus amphitrite) have been altered by OA (Wong et al., 2011) . Thus, in contrast to oyster larval proteome, proteome of oyster mantle tissue and the barnacle larvae appear to be robust to OA stress. Such species specific response to OA at proteome level was not surprising because the sensitivity of OA was not uniform across animal groups (Doney et al., 2009) , i.e. some species are robust to OA (e.g. barnacle larvae) than do other species (e.g. oyster larvae) even at pH 7.4 (Whiteley, 2011) . Altogether, our global protein expression analysis demonstrates the presence of a compensatory response to OA stress at the level of protein expression. Representative gel image of larval proteome analyzed by 2-DE are shown. There were three biologically independent gels per treatment. The 1st dimension was performed on pH 3-10 linear IPG strips; the 2nd dimension was run on home made 12.5% T acrylamide gel. Gels were stained with silver nitrate solution. Sample amount of protein loaded was 100 lg for each sample. Proteins identified are marked, and spot numbers refer to Table 1 .",

In this study, 3 calcium metabolism related proteins (two calmodulin and a troponin C protein) have been identified with high confidence using MS/MS evidence alone, which were significantly down-regulated in response to OA stress (Table 1) . During CaCO 3 shell formation process, the uptake, transport and assimilation of calcium ion are key steps which are governed by action of calmodulin and a potential calcium binding proteins such as troponin C (Yan et al., 2007; Yamamoto et al., 1987) . Their down regulation, as observed in this study, is likely to slow down calcification process in OA exposed larvae. It should be noted that, oyster larvae used in this study have started to grow at slower rate in OA treatment soon after the Day 4. Repression of these calcification-related proteins by OA in Day 4 larvae could be a preparatory phase or machinery for subsequent slow calcification growth phase. However, only future investigations will confirm and determine the nature of this hypothetical correlation between low production of calcium metabolism proteins and slow larval shell growth as a compensatory response to OA. Along with these calcification-related proteins, expression of cytoskeleton proteins was decreased substantially in response to OA (Beta-tubulin and tektin in Table 1 ).

In oyster, oxidative stress occurs in response to OA which in turn suppress cytoskeleton production (O'Donnell et al., 2010; Tomanek et al., 2011) . Overall, these results suggest that both calcification and cytoskeleton related proteins were highly suppressed by OA. Vacuolar H [+] -ATPase was seen up-regulated indicating that oyster larvae respond to the changes in the acidic environment, by altering its cellular proton transportation at the expense of ATP. Up-regulation of this pump possibly increases the rate of proton exchange maintaining normal intracellular functions (Lopez-Martinez et al., 2009) . Other OA studies demonstrated that down-regulation of ion transporters (Todgham and Hofmann, 2009) or unchanged activity in long term exposure (Lannig et al., 2010) and their up-regulation in early stages of exposure (Hu et al., 2011; Stumpp et al., 2011) . One of the larval responses to OA stress is the induced expression of a large number of genes whose products (proteins) are assumed to be involved in various adaptive functions under stress conditions such as heat-shock proteins (Cummings et al., 2011) . Unfortunately, heat shock proteins (hsp) have not been identified that were differentially expressed in OA treatment. Alternatively, annexin -a stress related protein similar to hsp's was found to be increased within such a short exposure period in OA treated larvae (Gerke and Moss, 2002; Rhee et al., 2000) . Probably, hsp's might have been differentially expressed but not expressed in abundance to enable us to identify them using our 2-DE approach. Most studies on molecular plasticity to OA to date have only focused on the changes in gene expression, whereas there is no information available on their functional products, proteins (Hofmann and Todgham, 2010; Tomanek, 2011) . Genes exhibiting a plastic expression pattern with respect to OA stress have been identified as candidates with putative roles in OA stress tolerance compensatory mechanisms (Martin et al., 2011) . In this study, plasticity of the oyster larval proteome was revealed, and about 18% of the protein spots were affected by OA stress (see Fig. 2 ). We believe that these differentially expressed proteins or proteome plasticity might allow oyster larval to survive in OA but with delayed shell growth (Fig. 1) . However, for firm conclusion and to prove this hypothesis, future studies should confirm functional role of the identified OA stress responsive proteins in stress tolerance using chemical inhibition and gene knock procedures.

A simple and a reproducible 2-DE based proteomic approach have been described to examine proteome level changes to high-CO 2 . Surprisingly, the expression of 71 out of 379 proteins was either decreased or completely lost or expressed below the detection limit after exposure to OA just for 4 days from fertilization. Importantly, expression of proteins related to calcification and cytoskeleton production appears to be severally suppressed by OA; however, further in vitro tests should be performed to confirm this hypothesis. Nevertheless, demonstrated altered expression pattern of proteins appears to be a part of biochemical compensatory mechanisms (a short-term adaptive response) in oyster larvae to OA stress. Thus, the application of recent advances in mass spectrometers and bioinformatics tool for protein identification, proteome maps generated using conventional 2-DE technique provides new insights into the effects of OA on organisms at molecular level.",

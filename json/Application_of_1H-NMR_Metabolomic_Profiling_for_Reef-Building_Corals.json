Metabolomic profiling can describe the response of individuals to disturbance (i.e., shifts in environmental conditions) across biological models and is a powerful approach for characterizing and comparing coral metabolism. For the first time, we assess the utility of a proton-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-NMR)-based metabolomics approach in characterizing coral metabolite profiles by 1) investigating technical, intra-, and inter-sample variation, 2) evaluating the ability to recover targeted metabolite spikes, and 3) assessing the potential for this method to differentiate among coral species. Our results indicate 1 H-NMR profiling of Porites compressa corals is highly reproducible and exhibits low levels of variability within and among colonies. The spiking experiments validate the sensitivity of our methods and showcase the capacity of orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) to distinguish between profiles spiked with varying metabolite concentrations (0 mM, 0.1 mM, and 10 mM). Finally, 1 H-NMR metabolomics coupled with OPLS-DA, revealed species-specific patterns in metabolite profiles among four reef-building corals (Pocillopora damicornis, Porites lobata, Montipora aequituberculata, and Seriatopora hystrix). Collectively, these data indicate that 1 H-NMR metabolomic techniques can profile reef-building coral metabolomes and have the potential to provide an integrated picture of the coral phenotype in response to environmental change.",

This feature reflects the combined physiology of a diverse assemblage of microorganisms and algal partners that comprise the coral holobiont [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . While research has focused on describing differential responses of corals and their partners to environmental stress [12, 13, [16] [17] [18] [19] , the development of tools that can be broadly deployed and used to rapidly assess coral health trajectories is still in its infancy. Applications of 'omics' techniques are enhancing these efforts and are describing coral resistance, resilience, and function [20] . While there are challenges and limitations in interpreting these large datasets [20] , global analyses of genes [21] , transcripts [22] , and proteins [23] are advancing our understanding of holobiont responses to ecological disturbances. However, these techniques are currently too expensive to apply in reef-wide monitoring programs. Consequently, there is still a need for cost-effective molecular tools that can be proactively used to assess coral metabolic states.",

For instance, select groups of compounds, such as sugars, lipids and mycosporine like amino acids have received considerable attention in the literature due to their biochemical roles in maintaining coral metabolism. However, other metabolites such as steroids, isoprenoids, alkaloids, and sulfur containing compounds, such as dimethylsulphoniopropionate and acrylate, are also critical for coral reproduction, growth, survival and maintenance of symbiotic status [24] [25] [26] [27] . A more comprehensive description of coral metabolite composition could further elucidate the role of metabolites and pinpoint metabolic pathways essential for coral resilience to environmental change, thereby providing a means to gauge coral biological performance.",

This holistic approach takes advantage of metabolite profiling methods using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and/or mass spectrometry (MS) techniques to capture organism responses to external conditions.

These methods are applicable across scientific disciplines and can identify bioactive compounds, assess food safety, and describe the function of unknown genes [28] [29] [30] . Of particular interest to coral reef scientists is the capacity of metabolomic tools to identify metabolites and profiles that may serve as biomarkers for disease or stress response [31] [32] [33] [34] .

Furthermore, 1 H-NMR techniques have been used to quantitatively investigate the concentration of select metabolites in Acropora spp. corals [38, 39] . To determine the efficacy of profiling reef-building coral metabolomes using 1 H-NMR methods, we conducted three independent experiments to assess the variability, sensitivity, and ecological relevance of our methods. First, we investigated variation in 1 H-NMR profiles within and among multiple coral colonies. Then, we explored the sensitivity of our techniques by spiking samples with various concentrations of metabolites known to occur in reef-building corals. Finally, we compared metabolite profiles from four coral species to determine if our methods describe signatures inherent to taxonomic divisions. Our results collectively demonstrate that 1 H-NMR techniques are a viable and powerful tool for assessing the metabolomes of reef-building corals.",

Spectra were acquired using a water suppression pulse sequence (PRESAT), consisting of 132 (extraction method 1) or 64 (extraction method 2) transients of 32 K data-points with a relaxation delay of 1 s (extraction method 1) or 3 s (extraction method 2) over a spectral window of 5500 Hz. Resulting spectra were zero-filled to 64 K and multiplied by a line-broadening factor of 0.5 Hz prior to Fourier transformation. Spectra were imported in to MestreNova (Mestrelabs version 7.1.2), where spectral baselines were adjusted using Whittiker smoothing and normalized to the total area. Three alignments were created to compare 1 H-NMR (1) profile variability, (2) spectra spiked with the metabolite cocktails, and (3) fingerprints among coral species. All alignments were reduced to ASCII files. Variables corresponding to the residual water impurity (4.48-4.92 ppm) and an observed acetone contaminant (2.22-2.27 ppm) were removed. Alignments were imported into Metabolink (http://metabolink.knoesis.org), where a dynamic adaptive binning routine was used to identify each peak as a separate variable [43] . For each alignment, bins were found between 0.5 to 10 ppm. R statistical environment (version 3.0.0, R Development Core Team 2013, http//www.R-project.org) was used for all further analysis, including normalizing spectral intensities to extract weights for comparison across samples.",

OPLS-DA was applied to discriminate between H-NMR profiles arising from (1) spiking treatments and (2) among coral species (for source code see http://birg.cs.cofc.edu/index.php/O-PLS). Model strength was assessed using both R 2 and Q 2 metrics. R 2 values report the total amount of variance explained by the model in both the H-NMR data (R X) and independent variables (R 2 Y; e.g., spiking treatment or species identity). Q 2 reports model accuracy and is calculated by 10-fold cross validation. The resulting Q 2 statistic was compared to a null distribution to test model significance (p,0.05). OPLS-DA is advantageous over analogous methods (e.g., partial least squares-discriminate analysis) because it looks to partition between-group variation (t) in H-NMR profiles from within-group variation (t-orthogonal), which enhances the interpretability of the resulting model [46] . Implementing the n-group OPLS-DA model. OPLS-DA typically is employed to discriminate between two treatment groups [46] . However, when there are more than three groups, the resulting model is influenced by group order. To facilitate comparing metabolite fingerprints among spiking treatments and reef-building corals, we developed an iterative strategy based on the magnitude of Q 2 to determine group ordering in the model. The algorithm finds the maximum Q 2 value between the two groups with the largest separation along the t-axis. Additional groups are inserted into the model based on the magnitude of Q . The overall Q 2 value is determined from model projections after allowing groups to cluster together based on profile similarities. This strategy allows the OPLS-DA model to dictate where added groups should reside with respect to those present. Furthermore, it provides information describing the similarity between groups (i.e., groups with similar profiles will have similar t values and be plotted closer together). Finally, the OPLS-DA algorithm calculates coefficients describing the contribution of each variable to the model.",

Intra-colony variation in H-NMR spectra from P. compressa was low and equal to that of technical replicates. As expected, variation in metabolite fingerprints is higher among different coral colonies. Together, these results indicate that while metabolite composition is relatively homogeneous within a coral colony, genotypic differences among colonies elevate variability in metabolite profiles. Notably, the variability in metabolite profiles described here are consistent with reports [44] for fish, marine invertebrates, and mammals, where relative standard deviations (RSD) across 1 H-NMR bins are lower across technical replicates (median RSD range 1.6-20.6%) and increase with biological replication (median RSD range 7.2-58.4%).",

However, after Chenomx identified and quantified signals from the spiking compounds (alanine, glucose, and glycolic acid), a Kruskal-Wallis test only detected significant differences in the 10 mM treatment group in comparison to the others (Table 3 ). These results suggest that detecting small differences in individual metabolite concentrations (i.e., between the control and 0.1 mM treatments) may be constrained by dynamic signals within the coral metabolome or by background noise in 1 H-NMR spectra. It is clear that the majority of the 1 H signals arising from alanine, glucose and glycolic acid fall in regions of high peak overlap in coral 1 H-NMR spectra (Fig. S2 and Fig. S4 ). This limits the ability to detect small differences in metabolite concentrations. For instance, a recent targeted application of 1 H-NMR spectroscopy detected significant differences in dimethylsulphoniopropionate and acrylate, both of which resonate in regions of low spectral complexity, as low as 1.4 nmol/mm 2 between corals exposed to ambient and high temperature conditions [39] . These compounds did not contribute to separation in metabolite profiles among spiking treatments or coral taxa investigated here, which is expected given that they naturally occur in similar concentrations across individuals [38] . While targeted studies using 1 H-NMR techniques are informative towards describing and quantifying known metabolites, shifts in coral metabolomes may occur inside regions of high peak overlap. Furthermore, by comparing spectra with multivariate techniques, we can identify combined signals that better resolve differences in metabolite concentrations. Taken together, the current data suggest multivariate techniques enhance the capacity to identify small fluctuations in coral 1 H-NMR profiles in comparison to univariate methods. Consequently, when using H-NMR techniques to investigate coral metabolomes analyzing complete spectra may be more informative than comparing changes in individual compounds.",

However, of these 27 compounds, only a few were matched to Chenomx database entries and include trigonelline, alanine, several branch chained amino acids (e.g., valine, isoleucine and leucine), and organic acids (threonine or lactate). Our work highlights the challenges associated with metabolite identification using 1 H-NMR metabolomics. NMR instrumentation is less sensitive than mass spectrometry. Overlapping signals, variation in sample pH, ionic strength, temperature and acquisition conditions can obscure accurate database assignments. Past studies have typically identified between 2 and 15 compounds that separate 1 H-NMR profiles in non-model species such as Mytilus edulis or Carcinus maenas exposed to disturbance (e.g., copper exposure or ocean acidification [52, 56] ). In contrast, 1 H-NMR-based metabolomics have identified upwards of metabolites driving differences in the metabolism of model organisms (e.g., impacts of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections in mice [57] ). Lack of taxa-specific metabolite databases reduces the capacity to identify small compounds in non-model species. To overcome these challenges, research is focused on developing analytical (e.g., cyroprobes, increases in magnet strength, 2D-NMR techniques; reviewed by [58, 59] ), bioinformatics [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] and databases tools [65] to facilitate matching 1 H-NMR profiles to known metabolites.",

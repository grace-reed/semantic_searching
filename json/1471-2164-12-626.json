    "abstract": "Background: Fish under intensive culture conditions are exposed to a variety of acute and chronic stressors, including high rearing densities, sub-optimal water quality, and severe thermal fluctuations. Such stressors are inherent in aquaculture production and can induce physiological responses with adverse effects on traits important to producers and consumers, including those associated with growth, nutrition, reproduction, immune response, and fillet quality. Understanding and monitoring the biological mechanisms underlying stress responses will facilitate alleviating their negative effects through selective breeding and changes in management practices, resulting in improved animal welfare and production efficiency. Results: Physiological responses to five treatments associated with stress were characterized by measuring plasma lysozyme activity, glucose, lactate, chloride, and cortisol concentrations, in addition to stress-associated transcripts by quantitative PCR. Results indicate that the fish had significant stressor-specific changes in their physiological conditions. Sequencing of a pooled normalized transcriptome library created from gill, brain, liver, spleen, kidney and muscle RNA of control and stressed fish produced 3,160,306 expressed sequence tags which were assembled and annotated. SNP discovery resulted in identification of~58,000 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms including 24,479 which were predicted to fall within exons. Of these, 4907 were predicted to occupy the first position of a codon and 4110 the second, increasing the probability to impact amino acid sequence variation and potentially gene function. Conclusion: We have generated and characterized a reference transcriptome for rainbow trout that represents multiple tissues responding to multiple stressors common to aquaculture production environments. This resource compliments existing public transcriptome data and will facilitate approaches aiming to evaluate gene expression associated with stress in this species.",

During transportation and sorting, several factors may also lead to stress including handling and tank confinement [3, 4] . Osmoregulatory disturbance may be an outcome of stress, for which altered salinity is routinely used to mitigate negative effects, however high salinity such as in adaptation to seawater induces a stress response [5] . These and other stressors which are common to aquaculture production can induce physiological responses which may have adverse effects on traits important to producers and consumers, including those associated with growth, nutrition, reproduction, immune response, fillet quality, and environmental impacts [1, 2, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .

                "text": "Studies which aim to characterize global gene expression in response to stress often use hybridization-based approaches (i.e. microarrays) to identify differences between challenged and control fish [14] [15] [16] . Hybridization techniques including those that employ microarrays can be high-throughput and are relatively inexpensive, however they present some limitations [17] . For instance: 1) the preparation of custom-made arrays requires previous knowledge of the target transcriptome expected to be represented in a sample; 2) hybridization data often present high background levels due to crosshybridization; and 3) microarrays are not suitable for genes expressed at very low or very high levels because there is a limited range of detection due to background and saturation [18] . Sequencing-based methodologies have also been used to characterize gene expression, full-length cDNA and EST (expressed sequence tags) libraries have been sequenced using Sanger technology, however, this method is low-throughput, expensive and usually not quantitative [17, 18] . Tag-based short sequence reads methodologies like SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) or MPSS (massive parallel signature sequence) are also high-throughput and quantitative, however the sequence reads cannot be unambiguously mapped to the reference genome; the transcriptome is still partially analyzed; and it is usually not possible to distinguish different gene isoforms [18, 19] . Recently developed high-throughput sequencing technologies offer a new approach (RNASeq) for characterizing transcriptomes through high-throughput sequencing, mapping and quantification [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . This approach is especially advantageous for non-model species, because it is not restricted by the unavailability of a genome reference sequence. Additionally, RNASeq has very low background and sequences can be unambiguously mapped to reference sequences. The quantification is based on the number of sequences obtained, therefore it offers the detection of a higher expression range and it is possible to identify low or highly expressed genes. Furthermore, this approach permits additional analysis such as the identification of putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can be identified in transcribed regions and have the potential to affect gene function [32] . RNASeq has previously been used for transcriptome characterization of non-model species, including butterfly [20] , silkworm [21] , garter snake [22] , coral [23] , pearl oyster [24] and several fish species [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , including rainbow trout [31] .",

The library construction included a normalization process [22, 23, 33] such that the reference transcriptome would constitute a qualitative resource attempting to represent the maximum number of unique transcripts from each of the tissues/treatment combinations as possible [26] . Although the majority of stress gene expression research in rainbow trout has concentrated on evaluating the effect of only one stressor on one specific tissue [34] [35] [36] , our goal was to capture and characterize a collection of transcripts from multiple tissues from fish exposed to one of five stressors. As a result we aim to establish a comprehensive stress transcriptome resource that will facilitate understanding stress responses in this species. To this end we selected stressors that are among those commonly experienced by rainbow trout during aquaculture production and transport including high temperature, low temperature, low DO/high CO 2 , seawater transfer, and handling/ confinement.",

Also, low temperature combined with sea water tolerance was analyzed by Findstad et al [38] who transferred fresh water acclimated rainbow trout to sea water at 1 and 8\u00b0C, and Saunders et al [39] who first acclimated the fish to salt water and placed them in floating cages until temperatures fell below 0\u00b0C. In this project we used similar parameters for high and low temperature and salinity treatments however we were conducted treatments independently. Previous studies have suggested that oxygen concentrations above 6 mg/l are not limiting factors for growth [40] and carbon dioxide in culture tanks should range between 10 and 20 mg/l [41] therefore we combined effects of low DO and high CO 2 by supplying fish with re-use water, a common practice in aquaculture production which uses water from rearing sites \"upstream\" to increase production capacity [42] . Finally, fish were subjected to a handling and confinement stress routinely used for rainbow trout stress response research [15, [43] [44] [45] [46] .",

The desired parameters for each treatment were obtained within three hours of the beginning of the respective experiments. Water pH values varied between 7.5 and 7.9 for both treatment and control conditions. Concentrations of nitrogenous compounds levels were also within acceptable limits. In the \"high temperature\" treatment tanks, temperatures were elevated from 14.3\u00b0C to an average of 22.6\u00b0C within three hours (time 3) and remained elevated until the six hour (time 6) sampling period, at which temperatures averaged 24.8\u00b0C. For the \"low-temperature\" treatment, water temperature was reduced to 1.8\u00b0C within three hours (time 3), and was maintained at an average of 2.3\u00b0C until time 6. DO levels are one of the most critical water quality parameters in trout culture and exposure to low levels of DO (5.0 -6.0 mg/l) can result in mortality [54] . However, critical levels are directly correlated with other water quality parameters, like water temperature. DO levels oscillated between 7.16 and 22.40 mg/l across the experimental tanks. Although the average DO concentration at sampling time (time 6) was lower in the reuse water treatment tanks than the control tank (7.8 versus 10.0 mg/l), it remained within acceptable limits for trout production. However, CO levels were significantly higher (67.8 mg/l average) in treatment tanks compared to control (21.7 mg/l). Recommended upper limits for dissolved CO range between 10 and 20 mg/l [55] .",

Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the response of plasma glucose, lactate, chloride and cortisol concentrations in addition to lysozyme activity, respectively, compared across all treatments and controls. Values from all control tanks were pooled and presented as a single mean, which was compared to the mean for each stress treatment. Plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower than control in high temperature and re-use water treatments, and significantly higher than control in the low-temperature treatment. Plasma lactate concentrations increased greater than 2-fold in high-temperature and saline treatments, and also increased after the handling treatment. In contrast, low temperature and re-use water treatments decreased plasma lactate concentrations. High temperature and saline treatments increased, while low temperature and re-use water treatments decreased plasma chloride concentrations compared to control. Lysozyme activity was slightly decreased in the re-use water treatment. Finally, plasma cortisol concentrations increased dramatically, between 5-to 12fold, compared to the controls, across all treatment groups. The magnitudes and directions of the differences of these parameters between treatments and the control groups reflect unique physiological response portfolios that result from each stressor, such that a sequencing a collection of transcripts isolated from tissues from stressed fish would serve as a qualitative representation of various physiological responses.",

The expression of p53 was reduced in the reuse water and salinity treatments and increased in the high temperature treatment (Figure 4b ). Nupr1 is also a multifunctional protein and similar to p53, this protein can be induced by different stressors and takes part in apoptosis regulation [60, 61] . Momoda et al. [35] studied gene expression in rainbow trout liver after handling stress, and documented an increased expression after 3 hours of stress and even higher after 21 h. However, in the current study, nupr1 expression was not significantly different from the control for any of the stress treatments. Heat shock proteins (HSP) were initially identified as being induced after stressful thermal conditions; however, it is presently known that this group of proteins also responds to other environmental stressors [37, 62] . Expression of hsp70b was up-regulated in high temperature and salinity treatments, with a dramatic 600-fold increase in expression with the high-temperature stress.

Ions like Na + , Cl -, Ca 2+ are actively transported across the gill epithelium to maintain high levels of ions in the blood. Euryhaline fishes that move from freshwater to salt water transform their gills from ion absorbing mechanisms to an ionsecreting epithelium, resulting in an increase of Na+/K +-ATPase (nakatp) gene expression [63, 64] . A previous study of nakatp expression in rainbow trout gill [64] found that isoforms nakatpa1c and nakatpa3 did not respond to salinity exposure, while isoform nakatpa1a decreased expression within one day after being transferred to salt water and isoform nakatpa1b gradually increased its expression. In this study, expression of the nakatpa1a, nakatpa1b, and nakatpa1c isoforms were significantly reduced by high temperature treatment only. Isoform nakatpa3 showed increased expression in fish exposed to the salinity treatment ( Figure 4 ).",

Detailed information on the assembly results is presented in Table 1 . Newbler aligned 2,708,437 reads (85.7%) including 990,882,504 base pairs to contigs and 235,486 (7.4%) reads were identified as singletons. The sequences were assembled into 110,031 contigs with an average depth of 17.9\u00d7 coverage; 90,417 of them were at least 100 base pairs long. The contigs were linked to form 83,166 isotigs in 41,879 isogroups. In addition, 1,123 contigs were entered in the assembly results of isotigs. Those contigs were larger than 500 base pairs and did not belong to any isotigs. Thus, the total number of sequences assembled into isotigs was 84,289. Additionally, 235,486 reads that presented a certain level of redundancy were considered singletons by Newbler. Those sequences were re-assembled using MIRA3. Consequently, 91,926 more reads were assembled, resulting in 37,143 MIRA3 contigs. This step improved the prediction of different gene variants. For example, there are two known variants of the apaf1 gene, and Newbler assembly only predicted one of them, but MIRA3 identified the other variant. Sequence and assembly information for contigs, isotigs, and isogroups are available at http://www.ars.usda.gov/Research/docs.htm?docid= 8033.",

Moreover, the 143,560 reads listed on MIRA3 results as debris (singletons), were masked with RepeatMasker using the INRA (National Institute for Agricultural Research, France) Rainbow Trout repeat and cGRASP Salmon masker databases, and 39,210 masked sequences that have more than 300 base pairs of continuous non repetitive segments were also included in the annotation process.

In summary, of the 43,382 sequences that were assigned GO terms by B2G; 35,538 are involved in biological processes, 37,837 have molecular functions, and 36,316 are cellular components. Most of these sequences (86%) are distributed among two or three general GO term domains. In the biological process distribution, cellular process is the most abundant group (19%), followed by metabolic process (14%), and biological regulation (11%). Binding (51%), catalytic activity (26%), and molecular transducer activity (6%) are the top three distributed molecular functions. For cellular component, cell (44%) is the most found component, and other abundant cellular components are organelle (29%), macromolecular complex (12%), and membrane-enclosed lumen (9%). These results are presented in Additional File 2 Figure S2 . To evaluate the representation of genes associated with stress response in the stress reference transcriptome, we searched the Hit Description and Gene Ontology Term annotation in Additional File 1 (Table S2 Gene Ontology Annotation) for keywords associated with the treatments in our study. Results in Table 2 show that a significant number of sequences were identified from annotation associated with stress responses. Current rainbow trout transcriptome sequence datasets available in NCBI include 287,967 EST sequences in dbEST and the 454-pyrosequencing data submitted to SRA, which include 1,298,911 sequences of a Swanson double-haploid fish and 1,507,274 other rainbow trout cDNA sequences submitted by INRA. In addition, there are 116,463 sequence clusters generated from 391,356 rainbow trout mRNA and EST sequences in NCBI Uni-Gene database and 161,818 rainbow trout transcriptome reference sequences generated by Salem et al. [31] . We compared our sequence reads with all of these datasets, and found that 69.1%, 78.5%, and 56.2% of the reads can be mapped to the rainbow trout sequences in NCBI EST, NCBI SRA for double-haploid fish, and NCBI SRA from INRA, respectively. Moreover, only 67.5% and 55.2% of the reads can be aligned or partially aligned to the rainbow trout cluster sequences in NCBI UniGene database, and the transcriptome reference sequences of Salem et.al., respectively. These comparisons suggest that significant amounts of new data have been generated in our dataset.",

A total of 57,207 SNPs were identified from the [65] . To determine the potential for sequence variation to influence gene function we identified the location of putative SNPs in relation to gene sequences based on BLASTx alignments. Overall, 24,479 putative SNPs were determined to fall within exons, 4907 of which were located in the first position of a codon and 4110 the second, both sets expected to impact amino acid sequence and potentially gene function. We also predicted that 15,321 putative SNPs are located in the third position, which as expected is much more than the first and second positions combined. An additional 1322 SNPs were determined to be within exons however discrepancies of SNP positions across multiple alignments resulted in uncertainty of codon position. It is likely that some of the putative SNPs are actually paralogous sequence variants (PSVs), and therefore are the result of gene duplication events and not sequence variation [66] . In salmonids we expect a high frequency of PSVs due to an evolutionarily recent genome duplication event [67] . However, as all the sequences are transcribed differences may still be relevant to gene function as evolutionarily diverged paralogs sometimes have unique expression profiles [68] . These putative SNPs will be incorporated into a data set previously isolated from a genomic DNA reduced representation library [69] for genetic analyses in rainbow trout (Additional  File 3 Tables S3 and S4 Figure 5 shows the species represented in the top BLASTx hit for each isotig. experiment would not produce meaningful quantitative data. However, additional studies of these samples using RNA-Seq will permit such an analysis, yet we must first determine how to distinguish differential expression of allelic variants from that of closely related genes resulting from the genome duplication events.",

Subsequently, GS De Novo Assembler (Newbler) v 2.5p1 was used for sequence assembly. Default parameters for the algorithm of transcriptome assembly were selected, except for specific threshold parameters for generating isotigs. To further ensure the quality of the input reads, the contaminant database included in SeqTrim [79] package for screening of contaminant sequences such as those of Escherichia coli and cloning vectors was used as the optional trimming database of Newbler, in which a read is screened out if it entirely matches with a sequence in the contaminant database. The transcriptome algorithm of Newbler aligns one read completely or partially to a contig. This pipeline also identifies whether a read is repetitive, a singleton or too short (< 50 base pairs) to be used in the computation, or even if it is problematic for assembly. Portions of repetitive reads were included in the assembly results if they aligned to unique contigs. A unique feature of Newbler v2.3 and higher, is the ability of inferring splice-variants in its transcriptome assembly algorithm, in which all contigs are grouped into collections called isogroups based on the contig branching structures and the contig branching structures in each isogroup are further traversed, resulting in a set of isotigs, each representing a possible traversing path of the contigs in the isogroup. Therefore, there is a hierarchical structure among isogroups, isotigs, and contigs. An isogroup, which is analogous to a gene, is composed of a set of isotigs, which can be thought as all possible isoforms (splicing variants) of the gene; and an isotig contains one or more contigs, which can be roughly considered as exons in the gene as demonstrated by Ewen-Campen et al. [80] . In our study, some threshold parameters for generating isotigs were set to the maximum allowed values: the maximum number of isotigs in an isogroup was set to 1000, the maximum number of contigs in an isogroup to 1000, and the maximum number of contigs in one isotig to 200. These parameters enabled the program to generate all possible isotigs for most isogroups. After analysis, several reads were considered singletons by Newbler which included similar sequences, therefore Newbler singleton sequences were re-assembled using MIRA3 (MIRA-3.2.1).",

Using ssaha2 [84] , repeat masked sequences with less than 100 base pairs of consecutive unmasked bases were mapped to the assembly contigs that were longer than 100 base pairs. Then ssaha_pileup pipeline was used to detect sequence variations among the mapped sequences. In order to increase the accuracy of the prediction, the identified putative SNPs were then further processed. First, putative SNPs having total component reads less than five or the component reads for the minor allele less than two were excluded. Then, to address the homopolymer errors commonly found in 454 sequences, only putative SNPs that were at least 50 base pairs apart from other putative SNPs were included. Additionally, flanking sequences were required to be at least 25 base pairs long. Alignment results for the Newbler isotigs and MIRA3 contigs from the BLASTx phase of the BLAST2GO annotation (see below) process were queried to identify query start, query end, and SNP position. These data were used to identify whether or not the SNP occurred inside an exon; if so they were used to calculate if the SNP is in the first, second or third position of the codon. Only data that was in agreement across all BLASTx alignments for each query was considered a positive result.",

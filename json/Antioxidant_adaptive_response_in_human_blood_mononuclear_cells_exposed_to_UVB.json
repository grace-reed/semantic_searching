This antioxidant adaptive response appears to be directed towards the maintenance of low intracellular steady state concentrations of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide and a low rate of reactions initiated by oxygen free radicals [6] [7] [8] .",

Because so many stimuli elicit the same cellular defence mechanism, researchers commonly refer to it as the stress response through the expression of stress proteins [ 12] . The adaptation of bacteria to oxidative challenges has been extensively studied [ 12] . Analogous responses have been identified in human cells, such as the induction of haem oxygenase by UVA/H202 [ 13] , tyrosine phosphatase by H202, UV and menadione [ 14] in fibroblasts and superoxide dismutase by paraquat [ 15] in leukocytes. Lymphocytes show increased antioxidant enzyme activities when supplemented with rose bengal (RB), and a threshold of chromosomal damage (two chromosomal aberrations per cell) is apparently required to activate oxidative stress genes [4] . Human blood mononuclear cells exposed to visible light (400-550 rim) show increased activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and DT-diaphorase, with a small decrease in cell viability [5] .",

The induction reported by us agrees with the view that both superoxide dismutase and DT-diaphorase may display a concerted antioxidant role in vivo [31] . DT-diaphorase catalyses the two-electron reduction of quinones and related quinonoid acceptors to quinols [ 32] , whose auto-oxidation products, superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, must be kept at low intracellular steady state concentrations [ 6, 33 ] .

The process of signal transduction leading to the antioxidant adaptive response is certainly complex and probably includes endogenous photosensitization in which the generation of the excited species (A*) constitutes the first step, as follows A~A* A* +02\"*02 +A + A* J\u00a2~ O2 \"~ 102q-A Molecules (A) absorbing in the UVB range include flavoproteins, quinones, cytochrome c (W band) and NAD (P)H, which may lead to the production of superoxide anion (type I process) or singlet oxygen (type II process) [35, 36] , both reactive oxygen species capable of acting as secondary messengers. This mcchanism provides a basis for explaining the effects of visible light, RB, RB and visible light and UVB (280-315 nm) light. RB is taken to its excited state (RB*) by energy transfer from endogenously generated excited carbonyls [ 37] RB + RCO* -o RB* + RCO Although different mechanisms are involved, the effect of UVB in human cells, producing both the inactivation of enzymes (succinate dehydrogcnase and cytochrome oxidase) and increases in enzyme activity (DT-diaphorase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) [4, 5] , may resemble the effect of UVC in prokaryotes in which irradiation produces structural damage, e.g. thymidine dimers, and triggers UV damage repair mechanisms [ 38] .",

UVB radiation is known to penetrate almost completely the stratum corneum of Caucasian skin, and to irradiate a significant number of ceils in the peripheral circulation; 35% of 313 nm radiation may reach the viable layer of the skin [39] .

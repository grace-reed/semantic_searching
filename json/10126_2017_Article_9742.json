This study aimed to determine whether the baseline gene expression of abalone before a laboratory-induced summer mortality event was associated with resilience to summer mortality. Tentacle transcriptomes of 35 greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) were sequenced prior to the animals being exposed to an increase in water temperature-simulating conditions which have previously resulted in summer mortality. Abalone derived from three source locations with different environmental conditions were categorized as susceptible or resistant to summer mortality depending on whether they died or survived after the water temperature was increased. We detected two genes showing significantly higher expression in resilient abalone relative to susceptible abalone prior to the laboratory-induced summer mortality event. One of these genes was annotated through the NCBI non-redundant protein database using BLASTX to an anemone (Exaiptasia pallida) Transposon Ty3-G Gag Pol polyprotein. Distinct gene expression signatures were also found between resilient and susceptible abalone depending on the population origin, which may suggest divergence in local adaptation mechanisms for resilience. Many of these genes have been suggested to be involved in antioxidant and immune-related functions. The identification of these genes and their functional roles have enhanced our understanding of processes that may contribute to summer mortality in abalone. Our study supports the hypothesis that prestress gene expression signatures are indicative of the likelihood of summer mortality.",

Higher water temperatures are known to result in chemical changes in water quality (elevated ammonia, changes to pH, lower dissolved oxygen, and nutritional factors) which compromise the immune system and make species more vulnerable to mass mortality from diseases such as those caused by Vibrio sp.

The value (e.g., growth and quality) of surviving animals can also be impaired (Morash and Alter 2015). Age is known to be an important factor for mollusks when investigating their reaction to stressors brought on by climate change (Clark et al. 2013) . Adult mollusks are known to be more susceptible to the effects of summer mortality than juveniles (Travers et al. 2009 ). When exposed to increased temperatures, the survival rate of 2-year-old H. laevigata has been demonstrated to be significantly higher than when compared to 3-year-old H. laevigata (Stone et al. 2014) . The timing and energetic requirements of reproduction are suggested to be important factors in determining resistance to summer mortality, with resistant oyster lines known to possess slow gametogenesis and diminished reproductive potential (Huvet et al. 2010) . By studying the differential gene expression patterns of the gonads between summer mortality resilient and susceptible Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), it has been suggested that the need to invest in reproduction may be resulting in energy trade-offs from important processes such as antioxidant defense, which can result in oxidative stress and mortality (Fleury et al. 2010) .",

These genes are thought to normally have a higher baseline expression in heat-resilient individuals compared to heat-susceptible under ambient temperature. Several molecular chaperones and antioxidant genes have been identified to be more highly expressed in southern populations of the marine snail, Chlorostoma funebralis under ambient temperatures, in comparison to northern populations (Gleason and Burton 2015) . The authors suggested that the preadaptation to heat stress contributes to the higher thermal tolerance of southern populations. The specific actions of genes with a lower baseline expression in heat-resilient individuals are unclear. However, Barshis et al. (2013) suggested that they might represent a different type of frontloading, with their limited expression having direct effects on the expression of other vital stress-response genes. To date, there has been no study that has specifically analyzed the gene expression differences between summer mortality-susceptible and summer mortalityresilient abalone preceding a heat spike event.",

Abalone used in this trial were spawned in 2009. In June 2012, the abalone were stocked in aquaria at the Port Lincoln Marine Science Centre, South Australia (Fig. 2 ). Weight and length were measured and abalone were stocked into 16 tanks with a tank capacity of 60 L. Tanks were filled to half capacity, stocked with ten abalone each and acclimatized to conditions at~18\u00b0C for 5 days. The water quality parameters including temperature and dissolved oxygen were recorded once per day. Abalone health was monitored each day after the acclimatization period over the duration of the experiment. Any abalone recorded to be moribund or dead were removed from aquaria, sampled, and frozen (\u221280\u00b0C). On day 6, the heaters for each tank were set to 19\u00b0C. Water quality (temperature and dissolved oxygen) was recorded twice per day from this point. On day 9, heaters were raised to 20\u00b0C. On day 18, the heaters were lowered to 18.5\u00b0C following the sample collection. Mortalities throughout the experiment were recorded up to day 75 of the experiment, with the last mortalities recorded on day 56 (Fig. 2) . The results from the epipodial tentacle samples taken after temperatures were increased (i.e., on days 5, 13, and 18) will be the subject of further study focusing on differential gene expression during heat stress and are outside the scope of this study. The present study focuses on differential expression prior to heat stress. Abalone that survived the heat trial experiment and remained alive after the 75day period were deemed to be Bresilient.^Abalone that survived after day 18 but died before day 75 were considered to be Bsusceptible.^Following the rapid increase in temperature and 2 weeks of heat stress, 60 abalone died (deemed susceptible abalone) ( Fig. 2) , as expected for a summer mortality event.",

The Elliston population consisted of five resilient and six susceptible abalone, while the Farm Beach population consisted of four resilient and six susceptible abalone. The sex of the abalone was unable to be determined as the animals were immature. Total RNA was extracted from epipodial tentacle samples collected 6 months prior to stress tests using an RNeasy\u00ae Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Tissue samples were disrupted and homogenized using a desktop homogenizer (Janke & Kunkel, Ultra-Turrax T25). RNA quality and quantity was estimated using a Thermo Scientific Nanodrop 2000. Quality control and sequencing was outsourced to the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF). The quality of the RNA was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Expert Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), using the Eukaryote Total RNA Nano assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples had RNA integrity number (RIN) value equal to or greater than 9.6.

To test for differential gene expression, individual sequence reads for each sample were mapped back to the assembled transcriptome with the alignment program Bowtie (Version 1.0.0) (Langmead et al. 2009) as implemented in Trinity (version 10.5.2012) (Grabherr et al. 2011) . Total counts were determined for each gene model by counting the number of reads aligning to each gene model while avoiding multiple counting for reads that mapped to more than one isoform (gene expression sequence data used in this study will be deposited into the NCBI Short-Read Archive under Bioproject PRJNA286263). Count data was then used as input for the R package EdgeR (Robinson et al. 2010) which tests for differential expression based on a negative binomial distribution. Tests for differential expression were performed pairwise between different groups of susceptible and resilient abalone. Genes were deemed significantly differentially expressed if they had a Benjamini Hochberg adjusted P value (FDR) <0.05 which accounts for multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg 2000) . Four differential expression analyses were performed to examine the differences in gene expression between susceptible and resilient abalone prior to a summer mortality event: (I) all susceptible vs. all resilient, (II) susceptible vs. resilient Elliston sourced abalone, (III) susceptible vs. resilient Aquaculture sourced abalone, and (IV) susceptible vs. resilient Farm Beach sourced abalone. Weight, length, or growth rate were tested for association with stress resistance, but since no relationship was found, these factors were not included in the analysis model in the interest of parsimony. Family groups (two broad family groups exist for each source location, Online Resource 1: Fig. S1 and S2) and fitness groups (susceptible or resilient) were both included as factors in a general linear model for each location.",

The kyphoscoliosis peptidase isoform was significantly upregulated in resilient abalone from Elliston (Log 2 FC 7.42 FDR = 1.32E\u221202). Genes associated with two types of dynein heavy chains, and the gene related to the protection of telomeres had reduced expression in resilient Elliston abalone ([Log 2 FC \u22122.07, FDR = 2.88E\u221202], [Log 2 FC \u22122.37, FDR = 1.10E\u221202], [Log FC \u22121.52, FDR = 4.67E\u221203] respectively); however, the opposite trend was observed for Farm Beach, where upregulation was detected in resilient abalone. CD109 antigen (Log FC \u22122.26, FDR = 4.75E\u221202), calumenin (Log FC \u22121.70, FDR = 1.95E \u221202), sulfotransferase (Log FC \u22121.84, FDR = 1.26E\u221202), and the Toll-like receptor gene (Log FC \u22123.03, FDR = 3.63E\u221202) were all downregulated in resilient Elliston abalone. Similar gene trends were found in both Aquaculture and Farm Beach populations; however, they were not significant (Fig. 3) .",

Detailed gene expression signature patterns are difficult to interpret when displayed across all samples and differentially expressed genes at once (Fig. 5) . Comparing the resilient individuals within these closely related abalone identifies groups of genes that appear to correlate with whether an individual may be resilient or susceptible to the effects of summer mortality (Fig. 4) . Genes in clades B and C demonstrated similar gene expression patterns between the resilient individual (R269) (in clade 1) and its resilient cousins in clade 2. Notably, the susceptible siblings had a different gene expression profile to their resilient sibling R269. For example, differential gene expression is observed between susceptible and resilient abalone in genes related to ankyrin repeat domains (ANR65 HUMAN) and sodium and chloridedependent glycine transporters (SC6A9 XENLA). These two genes are significantly upregulated in resilient compared to susceptible abalone. In direct siblings, the expression pattern of these two genes appears to be representative of resilient and susceptibility. Furthermore, these two genes possessed a similar gene signature pattern (upregulation in resilient abalone) across both the Aquaculture and Farm Beach populations. However, the differential expression within these two populations was not significant (Fig. 3) .",

Both of these genes were significantly upregulated in resilient abalone in comparison to susceptible abalone. One of these genes was annotated as the transposon Ty3-G Gag Pol polyprotein based on homology to a protein from the anemone E. pallida. When each population was analyzed separately, we identified 68 genes that were each differentially expressed between resilient and susceptible abalone for particular source locations. These genes could potentially be responsible for mounting preparative defenses prior to stress exposure and summer mortality or potentially resulting in the activation of cascading downstream molecular pathways. These gene signatures may also reflect historical environmental conditions. Tissue and hemolymph from the epipodium has been used by previous studies to measure the transcrptomic response of abalone exposed to temperature stress (Liang et al. 2014) . The presence of differentially expressed genes identified in our study between heat stress-resilient and heat stresssusceptible abalone also suggests that the epipodium tissue, specifically that of the tentacles, is a valid tissue to use for transcriptomic analysis of heat-stressed abalone.",

One of these genes could not be annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database using BLASTX (no E-value cutoff). This suggests that this gene could be abalone specific, and as yet unknown due to the abalone being a non-model organism. The second gene identified in this analysis was assigned a significant match to a transposon Ty3-G Gag-Pol polyprotein gene in the anemone (E. pallida). Although this transcript shares a region of around 140 AA with a sea anemone transposon, direct homology with a confirmed Ty3-G Gag-pol protein could not be established. It is difficult to say for sure that it is a transposon without access to a H. laevigata genome. The transcript has no clear dominant reading frame and has stop codons in the same frame as the Ty3-G blast alignment. This suggests that while it may still be associated with transposon activity, its precise function is unlikely to be the same as Ty3-G. Transposable elements are capable of altering the function of genes with which they become associated through insertion into different positions in the genome. Transposable elements have also been suggested to have a role in epigenetic and adaptive response to environment and stress (Slotkin and Martienssen 2007) . No information is currently available for the function of transposable elements in abalone. Similar transposable elements have been shown to be induced by environmental stressors including temperature in the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and were suggested to have stressspecific regulation and have the potential to be used as effective biomarkers (de la Vega et al. 2007) . However, no specific mutagenic activity or function of these elements could be suggested without further sequencing or characterization (de la Vega et al. 2007) . Even if these elements do not result in direct transposition, they may still have a significant effect on the Fig. 4 Heatmap of the 59 significantly differentially expressed genes between susceptible and resilient abalone from a closely related group with Elliston ancestry (Online Resource 1: Fig. S1 and S2 ). Gene clades: (A) and (C) up-regulated in resilient abalone and (B) downregulated in resilient abalone. Tree labels indicate direct family sibling groups: (1) three direct siblings and (2) three direct siblings and one-half sibling (tag no. 42). Abalone labels are indicated on the bottom axis indicating condition (S susceptible, R resilient) and abalone ID. Family relationships of all individuals are indicated in Online Resource physiological status by affecting the regulation of surrounding genes (Krasnov et al. 2005) . The Ty3 gene pathway has been studied in many taxa including yeast (Menees and Sandmeyer 1996) , mammals (Volff 2009), fungi, plants, insects (Miller et al. 1999) , and fish and starfish (Britten et al. 1995) . The Ty3 pathway transposition has the potential to dramatically alter gene function and genome structure (Kumar and Bennetzen 1999) . The dose and duration of heat and copper stress is positively correlated with the ability of such transposable elements to reshape the genome of fungal plant pathogens, leading to adaptation (Chadha and Sharma 2014) .",

A similar gene to the sodium and chloride-dependent glycine transporter was found to be differentially expressed in the Pacific oyster (C. gigas) in low-salinity environments and has been suggested to be involved in hypo-osmotic adaptation (Meng et al. 2013) . Proteins that contain ankyrin repeats are sometimes known to be associated with immune responses (Voronin and Kiseleva 2008), and genes involved with the regulation of G-protein signaling pathways play a major role in cellular responses to extracellular stimuli (De Vries et al. 2000) . The naturally high expression of such genes in resilient abalone in comparison to susceptible abalone may play a role in enhancing preparatory defense mechanisms (Dong et al. 2008) , potentially enabling the resilient abalone to respond, cope with, or recover from the sudden stress brought on by a sharp increase in water temperature.",

CD109 antigen, calumenin, sulfotransferase, and Toll-like receptor genes were all significantly downregulated in resilient Elliston abalone, with the same general pattern seen in both Aquaculture and Farm Beach populations. Similar to our findings, high expression of a CD109 antigen precursor has previously been found to be associated with C. gigas susceptible to summer mortality (Fleury et al. 2010) . The expression pattern of Toll-like receptor genes is triggered by the recognition of microbial signal transduction pathways, assisting the innate immune system in detecting the invasion of microbial pathogens (Takeda and Akira 2005). Calumenin genes play a role in homeostasis, particularly in endoplasmic reticulum stress alleviation, and high expression has been correlated with a significant reduction in apoptosis in stressed cells (Lee and Kwon 2013) . The mechanisms regulating the expression of sulfotransferase 1C2 are relatively unknown; however, sulfonation likely plays an important role in the detoxification processes (Gamage et al. 2006) . The function of these genes are all related in some way to maintaining cellular health, which suggests that low level of expression of these genes is required to maintain fitness or that these genes are part of a downstream cascade of effects associated with higher resilience. An alternative explanation is that the downregulation of these genes in resilient abalone may allow the upregulation of other vital stress response genes for reducing or fighting stress.",

                "text": "Considering that this species of abalone possesses a pelagic larval stage of~1 week (McShane 1992) , it is possible that each of these source populations could have low connectivity along the southern coast of Australia. The metapopulation structure of H. laevigata has been suggested previously (Brown and Murray 1992) . Recently, Miller et al. (2014) studied the connectivity of H. laevigata throughout south east Australia and found that there was strong genetic structure (metapopulation structure) throughout the region. They suggested that a 135-km distance was an effective barrier to larval dispersal, with populations largely maintained by selfrecruitment within a 30-km area. The three source locations discussed in this study are subjected to different environment conditions. The Farm Beach coast is shallow, usually receiving only very low swell or wind waves, and is sheltered by 100-m-wide sand flats that can produce warmer water. The Elliston coast consists of rocks and reefs with deep colder waters close to the shore. The Aquaculture population had been subjected to an undocumented degree of selection for size and was sourced from regions of the coastline off Kangaroo Island and Taylor's landings, south Australia. The three original sources of the abalone lines were separated b\u1ef9 km, and, given the geographical spread and topology of the coastline, it is possible that a combination of low gene flow, and/or strong local selection pressures, may be resulting in the distinct gene signatures identified in this study. It is also possible that long-term adaptation to the environmental conditions of origin may have been due to epigenetic effects, whereby environmental stimuli changes DNA methylation, histone, chromatin, and/or other heritable changes affecting gene expression, without the underlying DNA sequence being altered (Moghadam et al. 2015) . Research into mussels with differing osmotic resistance capabilities has suggested that the differences between mussels from different regions is more likely the result of local adaptation than just the result of neutral genetic differences between populations (Landes et al. 2015) , or that local adaptation at least plays a major role (Riginos and Cunningham 2005) . However, it is difficult to determine whether the differences between the sample populations in this study are a result of local adaptation or just genetic differences brought on by isolation and drift. When populations inhabit a heterogeneous environment, selective pressures on a trait such as stress or disease resilience could differ across the species range. However, the detection of local adaptation is difficult when studying gene expression signatures because demographic history (population expansion, division, and bottlenecks), in the absence of natural selection, could also cause differences in gene expression signatures. By utilizing RNAseq to sequence the mantle transcriptome and conduct a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of the red abalone (H. rufescens) from a range of different environments, Wit and Palumbi (2013) showed that the selection of some genes related to hypoxia resistance and response to heat and pathogens did differ between abalone sourced from differing geographic locations as a result of differing selective pressures along the California coast. However, further study of genetic variation in populations along the southern Australian coast would be needed to determine if such selective pressures exist for H. laevigata.",

Interestingly, the HSP70 identified in this study only demonstrated a preadaptive signature in the resilient Aquaculture abalone.

The upregulation of genes associated with the protection of telomeres in susceptible abalone suggest that telomeres were at risk, with oxidative stress known to cause exponential telomere shortening (Richter and von Zglinicki 2007) . Progressive telomere shortening can lead to chromosome instability and the deterioration of cellular function. Dyneins assist in axonemal transport and are critical to maintain axonemal integrity and have been found to be negatively affected by oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species and linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Fang et al. 2012) . The upregulation of these genes in susceptible abalone might suggest that these highly expressed axonemal and telomere defense genes may come at an energetic cost to the animal and may contribute to their eventual susceptibility to summer mortality.",

A significant outcome of this study is the identification of genes that may highlight important areas of interest for future study, such as transposable elements and their potential role in epigenetic systems. Our data supports the hypothesis that summer mortality resilience could be partly influenced by prestress gene expression differences that prime an animal's physiology so that it can respond faster and more effectively to summer mortality events. As the analysis of differential expression was performed using a non-lethal method of tentacle sampling, we were able to sample na\u00efve animals before the stress challenge and look for associations between baseline gene expression signatures and resilience or susceptibility to heat stress. This non-lethal method could also allow us to sample, test, and possibly provide the ability to make predictions about the susceptibility of animals before the occurrence of the stress. This would be of significant value to the abalone aquaculture industry. With impending threats such as climate change, the genes identified in this study could also be incorporated into large-scale management programs for coastal systems aimed at conservation and restocking of wild abalone and other summer mortality-affected animals by identifying populations at risk.",

    "abstract": "Background: Coral bleaching can be defined as the loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae and/or their photosynthetic pigments from their cnidarian host. This major disturbance of reef ecosystems is principally induced by increases in water temperature. Since the beginning of the 1980s and the onset of global climate change, this phenomenon has been occurring at increasing rates and scales, and with increasing severity. Several studies have been undertaken in the last few years to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of coral bleaching but the jigsaw puzzle is far from being complete, especially concerning the early events leading to symbiosis breakdown. The aim of the present study was to find molecular actors involved early in the mechanism leading to symbiosis collapse. Results: In our experimental procedure, one set of Pocillopora damicornis nubbins was subjected to a gradual increase of water temperature from 28\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C over 15 days. A second control set kept at constant temperature (28\u00b0C). The differentially expressed mRNA between the stressed states (sampled just before the onset of bleaching) and the non stressed states (control) were isolated by Suppression Subtractive Hybridization. Transcription rates of the most interesting genes (considering their putative function) were quantified by Q-RT-PCR, which revealed a significant decrease in transcription of two candidates six days before bleaching. RACE-PCR experiments showed that one of them (PdC-Lectin) contained a C-Type-Lectin domain specific for mannose. Immunolocalisation demonstrated that this host gene mediates molecular interactions between the host and the symbionts suggesting a putative role in zooxanthellae acquisition and/or sequestration. The second gene corresponds to a gene putatively involved in calcification processes (Pdcyst-rich). Its down-regulation could reflect a trade-off mechanism leading to the arrest of the mineralization process under stress. Conclusion: Under thermal stress zooxanthellae photosynthesis leads to intense oxidative stress in the two partners. This endogenous stress can lead to the perception of the symbiont as a toxic partner for the host. Consequently, we propose that the bleaching process is due in part to a decrease in zooxanthellae acquisition and/or sequestration. In addition to a new hypothesis in coral bleaching mechanisms, this study provides promising biomarkers for monitoring coral health.",

In recent decades coral reefs have been dramatically impacted by large-scale disturbances [1] . Natural disturbances are a routine part of coral reef community dynamics, but they have increased in frequency and severity during the last three decades [1, 2] . In addition to providing multiple sources of anthropogenic disturbance that directly kill coral colonies [3] , human activities have likely contributed to the increase in natural disturbances via global warming.",

This often results in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by transport chain electrons [16] . ROS are highly cytotoxic and some of them can easily cross biological membranes leading to severe oxidative stress in both host and symbiotic cells. This oxidative stress can result in the activation of cell necrosis and apoptosis [17, 18] , which represent two of the six identified ways of endosymbiotic loss during bleaching [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . The four other ways of symbiont disappearance are: i) in situ digestion of zooxanthellae by the coral host [24, 25] , ii) expulsion by exocytosis or iii) by pinching off [24, 26] , and iv) host cell detachment [22] .",

Studies on early molecular mechanisms triggering and leading to these different ways of symbiotic loss are necessary to better understand the phenomenon and can provide early molecular markers to monitor coral health. In this context, several comparative molecular studies were undertaken. They compared healthy, semi-bleached and bleached corals or symbiotic versus aposymbiotic anemones. These studies revealed different genes involved in the response to the stress as well as genes putatively involved in bleaching mechanism or symbiosis breakdown/onset [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Some of the genes identified in these different studies are promising candidates to explain bleaching processes but studies on their expression and function are now necessary to validate their putative role. For example, a recent study of Desalvo et al. (2008) evidenced a putative calcium homeostasis disruption that could trigger different cellular processes leading to cell death via apoptosis and necrosis. Concerning symbiosis regulation, Sym 32, a fasciclin domain containing protein, was shown to be differentially expressed between symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones, could be involved in host/symbiont interaction and symbiosis breakdown under cadmium exposure [34, 36, 37] .",

To achieve this aim, we developed a comparative transcriptomic approach (by Suppression Subtractive Hybridization) comparing stressed corals before bleaching symptoms appears versus controls. Because our aim was also to develop functional markers that could be used to monitor coral health, we choose Pocillopora damicornis as a model species due to its widespread distribution in the Indo-Pacific region [38] and its high sensitivity during mass bleaching events [39] [40] [41] [42] . Our SSH approach led to the identification of two genes displaying an important down-regulation just before bleaching. Characterization of their precursors and immunolocalization experiments revealed their putative function and permitted the emergence of new hypotheses on coral bleaching mechanisms. In addition, these two genes constitute promising biomarkers for coral health monitoring.",

After 15 days at 32\u00b0C, bleaching induced a large increase in the standard deviation (SD) of zooxanthellae density in comparison to the other points of the kinetic, suggesting that symbiosis in some corals was starting to break.

The first SSH experiment was the result of the subtractive hybridization between the 31\u00b0C (D12) and control sets, and the second experiment between the 32\u00b0C (D15) and control sets. One hundred clones from each library were sequenced. To simplify the analysis, putative induced clones and putative repressed clones of the SSH libraries were respectively pooled in two new libraries called \"Bleaching Induced Genes\" (BIG) and \"Bleaching Repressed Genes\" (BRG). After sequencing, 147 and 118 high quality cDNA sequences were obtained from the BIG and the BRG libraries, respectively. BIG library ESTs coalesced into 15 contigs and 96 singletons, suggesting that the overall redundancy of the library was about 10.2% ( Table 1 ). The BRG library coalesced into 17 contigs and 70 singletons for an overall redundancy of 14.4% (Table 1) . In order to minimize redundancy in the EST database, sequences displaying 100% identity were submitted as a single sequence. ESTs aligning in the same contig but displaying differences in their nucleotidic sequence were submitted individually to the database. A total of 61 and 94 ESTs were submitted to the dbEST section of the NCBI/Gen-Bank database for the BIG and BRG libraries respectively (GenBank: GH706795 to GH706855 and GH706856 to GH706949, for BIG and BRG library respectively). ESTs were subjected to BLASTN and BLASTX searches. Sequence similarities were considered to be significant when the expected value (e value) was less than 10 -2 . Gene encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis, oxidative detoxification, intracellular signalling pathway, metabolism, cytoskeleton structure, conserved protein domains, calcium homeostasis, cell/cell or cell/ligand interactions, protein degradation, chaperone protein and protein synthesis were selected for further analysis [see additional file 1 for, Top blast, GeneBank accession number and specific primers used for Q-RT-PCR]. Among the tested clusters (data not shown), only clusters 12 and 27 showed a drastic regulation. They display 101 and 10.1 fold transcript decreases under stress, respectively. Clusters 12 and 27 belong to the functional class of cell/ cell or cell/ligand interaction and their putative functions make them promising candidates as key factors of symbiosis breakdown/maintenance. Consequently, we decided to focus the remainder of the present study on these genes.",

As the proteins sharing the uPAR/Ly6/CD59/Snake toxin domain are classically N-glycosylated and GPI anchored, the N-glycosylation and GPI anchored status of the Pdcyst-rich protein were investigated using NetGlyc and PSORT2 software [51, 52] .

The analysis of the primary structure by PSORTII prediction software revealed that it has a secretory protein-like structure with a 22 AA peptide signal sequence. The following 140 AA corresponded to a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) shared by a large group of extracellular Metazoan proteins [53] . This domain is involved in recognition and binding of carbohydrates in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner [54] . The alignment of PdC-Lectin with the most similar CTLD (Millectin of Acropora millepora, Mermaid-1 of Laxus oneistus, CD 23 and DC-SIGN from Homo sapiens), showed the presence of highly conserved cysteine residues (Position: 52, 122, 146, and 158 on the precursor; Figure 2B ). These residues are involved in the three dimensional structure by di-sulphide bond formation. C1 (position 52) and C4 (158) link \u03b25 and \u03b11 (the whole domain loop), and C2 (122) and C3 (146) link \u03b23 and \u03b25 (the long loop region, involved in Ca 2+ -carbohydrate binding and domainswapping dimerization) [53] . The \"WIGL\" motif present between the residues 63 and 68 is involved in the formation of all tree hydrophobic cores and contributes to structure stabilisation [53] . The presence of all conserved motif and key residues underlines the hypothesis that PdC-Lectin CTLD is functional [53] . The highly conserved motifs \"EPN\" and \"WND\" in the CTLD (Figure 2A ) argue in favour of the specificity for mannose binding in a Ca 2+dependent manner [53] . In addition, the MODWEB server [55] was used to perform the homology modelling of PdC-Lectin. It provides a molecular model based on the crystal structure of the human DC-SIGNR carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) [56] and presented a modelscore of 1.00 (a model is predicted to be good when the model score is higher than 0.7). The molecular model ( Figure 2C ) revealed that all residues involved in the binding of mannose in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner (EPN and WND) are located in similar structures (a long loop region for EPN and a \u03b2 strand for WND; Figure 2C ). Moreover, the four conserved cysteines and the \"WIGL\" motif known to be involved in the maintenance of the CTLD fold have a conserved position in the 3D structure (see superimposition of Figure 2C ). The differences (one loop and one \u03b2strand) which can be observed between the template and the molecular model are located in regions of the molecule that are not considered as essential for function (see Figure 2C ).",

Transcript amounts were expressed as a relative ratio to the control values obtained at 28\u00b0C (D3). For both genes, although zooxanthellae densities were stable until day 15 ( Figure 3B ), transcript decreases were observed after 12 days ( Figure 3A ). Indeed, 101 and 10.1 fold decreases were measured on the 12 th day (D12) of the protocol for Pdcyst-rich and PdC-Lectin genes. At 32\u00b0C (D15), the zooxanthellae decrease was non-significant and the levels of Pdcyst-rich and PdC-Lectin transcripts remained low (25 and 11 fold decreases, respectively compared to control, Figure 3B ).",

In the polyps, the tentacles are only composed of oral tissue ( Figure  5A ) whereas the coenosarc is composed of oral and the aboral tissues ( Figure 5B ). Each of these tissues is composed of an ectoderm separated from the endoderm by an acellular layer of mesoglea ( Figure 5B ). The oral endoderm faces the coelenteron (gastric cavity) and contains intracellular symbionts commonly called zooxanthellae. The aboral ectoderm faces the skeleton, is composed of calicoblastic cells and is referred to as the calicoblastic ectoderm or calicodermis.",

After SSH and validation steps, two genes belonging to the and interaction present an important down-regulation. Their down-regulation and putative function make them very promising candidates as key indicators of symbiosis breakdown/onset.

                "text": "The first gene, Pdcyst-rich, displayed significant similarities with a predicted protein of Nematostella vectensis. Their complete ORF characterization revealed that its precursor displays a putative signal of secretion and all key features shared by the uPAR/Ly6/CD59/Snake toxin family. As this domain is common to proteins involved in a large variety of functions, structural elements are not sufficient to provide hypotheses about the function of Pdcyst-rich. PCR experiments revealed that the corresponding gene is expressed in coral cells and complementary immunolocalization experiments showed that the protein displays a granular location in the calicoblastic ectoderm in contact with the skeleton. As Pdcyst-rich proteins are synthesized and stored in granules of this skeletogenic tissue, we investigated the suspected role of proteins of the uPAR/ Ly6/CD59/Snake toxin family in mineralization process. Two proteins were interesting in this context: RoBo-1 [58] and HEP21 [59] . The function of these proteins remains elusive but their involvement in mineralization process of bones and eggs was hypothesized [58, 59] . All these data taken together and in particular the granular location of Pdcyst-rich proteins in calicoblastic cells, suggests that Pdcyst-rich proteins could also play a role in the mineralization process. As it was shown that stress has an immediate effect triggering growth and calcification arrest in scleractinian corals [10, [60] [61] [62] , the strong decrease of the transcript corresponding to Pdcyst-rich protein could reflect the trade-off mechanism occurring during stress and leading to the arrest of the mineralization process. A recent transcriptomic study analyzing differential gene expression during thermal stress in M. faveolata also provides evidence of transcript decreases of genes involved in calcification [29] .",

It contains a putative signal peptide and a C-type lectin-like domain shared by a large group of extracellular Metazoan proteins with diverse functions [53] . This domain is involved in recognition and binding of carbohydrates in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner [54] . Alignments and diverse structural analyses revealed that PdC-Lectin is functional and shares the mannose binding spe- cificity characteristics of the human DC-SIGN CRD. The presence of the highly conserved motif \"EPN\" and \"WND\" in the CTLD of PdC-Lectin argues in favour of the specificity for mannose binding in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner [53] and the molecular model obtained using the MODWEB server reveals that all residues involved in this binding specificity are located in similar predicted structures by comparison with the human DC-SIGNR CRD. Moreover, the differences observed between the template (human DC-SIGNR CRD) and the PdC-Lectin molecular model are located in regions of the molecule that are not considered as essential for function. In addition, PdC-Lectin displays high similarities (E value = 1.10 -27 and see alignment Figure 2B ) for lectins recently characterized from Acropora millepora [43] . These lectins, named Millectin, were isolated by mannose affinity chromatography and were shown to bind to bacterial pathogens as well as coral symbionts, dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. All these elements taken together strengthen the hypothesis that PdC-Lectin is functional and shares the mannose binding specificity of the human DC-SIGN CRD.",

These colonies were then acclimatized to a temperature of 28\u00b0C for two weeks [62] . This temperature corresponds to the sea surface temperature observed during the warmer months in most coral reefs around the world [11, 60, [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . To create stress conditions triggering an in situ mass bleaching event, the temperature of the stressed set was increased by about 1\u00b0C every three days, until 32\u00b0C was achieved (D15). This last temperature corresponds to the maximal temperature observed in different coral reefs during mass bleaching events [11, 60, [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . This temperature threshold was then maintained until bleaching occurred (D18) while the control set was maintained at 28\u00b0C ( Figure 8 ). For each condition (stressed and control), three nubbins were randomly sampled at the end of each step (every three days). Three apexes of 0.5 cm were cut from each nubbin for zooxanthellae density measurements. Nub-bins and apexes were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysed. ",

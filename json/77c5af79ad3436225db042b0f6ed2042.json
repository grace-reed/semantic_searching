Hence future reefs are predicted to be dominated by non-constructional taxa. Since the Late Triassic however, other non-scleractinian anthozoans such as Heliopora have contributed to tropical and subtropical reef-building. Heliopora is an ancient and highly conserved reef building octocoral genus within the monospecific Family Helioporidae, represented by a single extant species-H. coerulea, Pallas, 1766. Here we show integrated morphological, genomic and reproductive evidence to substantiate the existence of a second species within the genus Heliopora. Importantly, some individuals of the new species herein described as Heliopora hiberniana sp. nov. feature a white skeleton indicating that the most diagnostic and conserved Heliopora character (the blue skeleton) can be displaced. The new species is currently known only from offshore areas in north Western Australia, which is a part of the world where coral bleaching events have severely impacted the scleractinian community over the last two decades. Field observations indicate individuals of both H. coerulea and H. hiberniana sp. nov. were intact after the 2016 Scott Reef thermal stress event, and we discuss the possibility that bleaching resistant non-scleractinian reef builders such as Heliopora could provide new ecological opportunities for the reconfiguration of future reefs by filling empty niches and functional roles left open by the regression of scleractinian corals. Scleractinian corals are the principal engineers of modern-day shallow water tropical coral reefs. The scleractinians originated approximately 450 mya from a solitary and azooxanthellate ancestor 1. But it was not until the middle Triassic (ca. 240 Ma) in tandem with dinoflagellate diversification events 2 that the modern shallow-water Scleractinia underwent their first major radiations. Since that time, scleractinian corals have endured massive climate changes, but the modern combination of contemporary climate and anthropogenic impacts has surpassed coral tolerance limits, and at many locations, scleractinians are retreating 3. The vulnerability of scleractinians threatens to jeopardize the accretion potential and productivity of coral reef ecosystems as a whole and as a result, coral reefs are predicted to transform in unprecedented ways. The most anticipated reconfiguration of future reefs involves transitions from hard coral to non-calcifying macroalgal communities or non-reef-building soft coral communities 4-6. Progressive shifts to altered reef states dominated by non-constructional taxa would jeopardize the biological functions and ecosystem services that coral reefs provide. Hence, maintaining the accretion potential and three dimensional structure of coral reefs is a priority 7.

It is often portrayed as a 'living fossil' because all of the morphological variation known from the fossil record is contained within the extant species 15 . The term living fossil has however, largely been abandoned because it does not reflect the genetic evolution within an organism 16, 17 . No study has tested genetic structure across the entire range of Heliopora, but two cryptic lineages were recently identified along the Kuroshio Current, from the Philippines through to Taiwan and Japan [18] [19] [20] . Both of these lineages share the distinctive blue skeleton. At sites where the two lineages occur in sympatry, dissimilarities in habitat use, growth form, as well as reproductive timing were observed. These studies highlighted that additional diversity is likely to be present within the Family Helioporidae.",

H. hiberniana sp. nov. is distinguished from H. compressa Verrill, 1864 by its fine branching clump growth form and highly elaborated echinulations. Heliopora compressa is described to have a thick, massive or encrusting base that forms plates with thin edges or lobe-like branches. It also has 2-3 elaborations per echinulation rather than 3-6 as in H. hiberniana sp. nov. Heliopora hiberniana sp. nov. is distinguished by H. fijiensis Hoffmeister, 1945 by its fine branching clump form, smaller autopores (0.58-0.69 mm) and smaller number of pseudosepta (12) (13) (14) (15) . Heliopora fijiensis is known only from fossil material and it is described as having an encrusting growth form with 14-17 pseudosepta and an autopore diameter of 0.75-0.9 mm.

There is however, no indication in the fossil record that the blue skeletal colouration is variable, and this suggests that colour trait lability may have evolved under contemporary environmental conditions. Understanding how this character change has occurred requires exploring why blue coral is blue. The distinctive blue colour of H. coerulea's crystalline aragonite skeleton is thought to be caused by the production of biliverdin IXa 23 . Biliverdin IXa is formed by the oxidative stress-inducible proteinheme oxygenase (HO) during heme decomposition 24 . A metatranscriptome analysis has confirmed the functional genes for heme synthesis are present in both Heliopora coerulea and its photosynthesizing symbiont 25 . However, the final part of the heme synthesis pathway, which converts biliverdin IXa to bilirubin via biliverdin reductase, was not identified. The absence of biliverdin reductase could be the reason why blue pigment accumulates in Heliopora. It is possible that H. hiberniana sp. nov. may have regained the ability to reduce biliverdin IXa, resulting in some individuals with partly or entirely white skeletons.",

However, the final number of loci included was low (n = 5) and the number of alleles these recovered was also generally very low (Table S7) , fundamentally reducing the power of the microsatellite data to resolve many individuals. Thus, we rely more strongly on the signal from the SNP data derived from MIG-sequencing.

Heliopora coerulea is a gonochoric surface brooder with an annual gametogenic cycle 27 . When sympatric individuals of the two species were sampled at Hibernia Reef in October 2013, all of the colonies of H. hiberniana sp. nov. had either mature or well-developed eggs in the coelenteron (Fig. 3) while H. coerulea colonies had either under-developed oocytes or were devoid of gametes. Biannual spawning is commonly reported in numerous other coral species in the north-western Australia 28 and the implications of this for genetic subdivision and speciation are beginning to be explored 29, 30 . The differential reproductive development in H. hiberniana sp. nov. and H. coerulea observed here suggests the two species may have a pre-zygotic reproductive barrier such as disparate spawning times. Hence, reproductive isolation is likely a driving or reinforcing mechanism for speciation in this highly conserved lineage.",

To answer this fully requires dating the divergence event, which we have not attempted in the present study. Octocorals utilize a mitochondrial DNA repair mechanism, resulting in very low rates of mutation 31, 32 ; this makes the recovery of a robust phylogenetic framework to constrain divergence events extremely difficult. More sophisticated data sources will be required to address this line of questioning. Nevertheless, in both the morphological and ITS2 phylogenetic reconstructions, H. hiberniana sp. nov. was derived within H. coerulea indicating it is more recently evolved. It will be important in the future to examine the relationships between H. coerulea and H. hiberniana sp. nov. and lineages HC-A and HC-B reported in 18, 19 .

Despite their persistence through ~ 450 mya of environmental variation 1 ; contemporary scleractinian corals are highly threatened by climate change 35, 36 . In 1998, between 80-90 percent of scleractinian coral at Scott Reef died resulting in a drastic reduction of the local brood stock and marked changes in community composition 33 . The fate of Heliopora was not recorded then, however in 2016 a second thermal stress event impacted coral communities at Scott Reef 35 and post-bleaching surveys conducted in 2017 indicate both H. coerulea and H. hiberniana sp. nov. persisted through this disturbance event (Richards unpublished , Fig. 7 ). Numerous other studies suggest H. coerulea is highly resistant to bleaching mortality 11, [37] [38] [39] and transcriptomic studies suggest Heliopora has an abundance of transcripts with heat shock protein and antioxidant domains which may relate to bleaching resistance 26 . If Heliopora has a higher probability of persisting through future disturbance regimes it may become an increasingly important component of tropical Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Thus, our findings may herald the start of a unique period of ecological opportunity and change where non-scleractinian reef builders such as Heliopora rise up to fill niches left open by retreating scleractinians 40 and play an important role in the reconfiguration of future reefs.",

In addition, a transition to Heliopora reefs may further impede scleractinian recovery because competitive exclusion via allopathy may inhibit the settlement of scleractinian coral juveniles 39 . This would also make it unfeasible to use Heliopora in the manipulative coral reef restoration approaches that are currently being explored 42 .

Heliopora is a resilient coral genus that has proven to be resistant to bleaching mortality 11, [37] [38] [39] .

Measurements of skeletal morphological characteristics were calculated from Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) images taken at three random, non-overlapping areas on the surface of eleven coral samples. Three 2-3 cm fragments were cut from each individual and mounted cut-side-down onto glass slides with carbon tape and coated with 10 nm of platinum and 10 nm of carbon. Images were taken using a Zeiss 55 field emission SEM set to 5 kV. Some of the white specimens had faint streaks of blue in the skeleton hence initially, corals were separated into three groups; 'Blue' , 'White' or 'Intermediate' . Replicate measurements of nine morphological characters (Table S1) were taken in four individuals of Heliopora coerulea (blue); four individuals of Heliopora sp. (white) and three individuals of Heliopora sp. (intermediate) ( Table S2 ). In order to avoid pseudoreplication, the three measurements from individual coral colonies were averaged, and the means from each individual coral were used as replicates. All data met assumptions of normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and assumptions of homogeneity of variance using Levene's test for equality of variance. To examine if the morphological characters of the three groups were significantly different one-way ANOVA's were conducted with 'Blue' , 'White' and 'Intermediate' set as fixed factors using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post-hoc test. Based on the results of this test, individuals from the 'White' and 'Intermediate' groups were pooled together to form the pooled 'White' Heliopora group. Data were re-checked for normality and for equality of variance. The measure 'autopore diameter' did not meet the equality of variance assumption. For all the data that did meet the assumption of equal variance, independent samples T-tests were conducted to test for differences in the means between the 'Blue' and pooled 'White' groups (Table S6 ). For the measure 'autopore diameter' , Welch's T-test was used, as it does not assume equal variance. All tests were conducted in SPSS version 21 45 .",

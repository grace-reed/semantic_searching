This reactive layer is fixed and thoroughly connected to the membrane by passing them through a calender. In order to produce the second electrode, the same steps are repeated. This procedure is very simple and, as a dry process, avoids the use of any solvents and drying steps. A thickness of the reactive layer as low as 5 pm has been achieved, reducing the amount of catalyst needed and, thus, the costs. Electrochemical investigations have shown a performance comparable to that of commercial electrodes. The degradation of MEA for polymer membrane fuel cell (PEFC) components during the cell's lifetime, yields a change in the electrochemical hehaviour. The characterization of PEFC MEA-components after electrochemical operation has given information about the degradation of electrodes and membranes and about the change in the platinum distribution on the anode, whilst on the cathode, the platinum content is unchanged.",

This paper develops scenarios of electricity demand in China until 2010, at a national, a sectoral and a regional level. It takes into account the recent macroeconomic downturn in the Chinese economy and the potential effects of deregulation and price increases in the power sector. The mediumgrowth scenario hints at a gross electricity demand of 1500 TWh in 2010; should the structural change from agriculture and heavy industry towards light industry and services accelerate, electricity demand may he another 10% lower. These figures are significantly below the projections fixed in the government's ninth 5-year plan, which forecasts a demand of 2500 TWh. The aggregate and sectoral scenarios imply that current development plans for generating capacity and coal consumption until 2010, too, need to he scaled down. The disaggregation at the level of the 13 inter-provincial and provincial power grids hints at potential regional discrepancies: the large industrial areas in eastern China and the Central region are likely to face overcapacity,",

It is perceived in public debate that monopolistic network operators (who are vertically integrated into competitively organized activities) would raise excessive access charges and derail competition by newcomers. Economic reasoning, however, suggests that the level of access charges is-at least in a stmple setting -irrelevant for the intensity of entry by newcomers. In a setting where access charges are price-cap regulated, theoretical considerations and empirical findings for the case of electricity distribution in England and Wales even suggest that inefficiently high access charges correspond with intense market entry. Efficiency concerns remain, nonetheless, If regulated by a practicable partial price-cap, the network operator may enforce monopolistic access charges in certain market segments. Access charges in other segments may he lowered strategically and may even he cross-subsidized.",

    "abstract": "The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a complex anaerobic metabolism and reacts to hypoxic or anaerobic conditions with the induced expression of many genes. One gene which is upregulated particularly strongly is the FDX5 gene, encoding one of at least six ferredoxin isoforms in C. reinhardtii. Fdx5 is a typical plant-type 2Fe2S protein that is located in the chloroplast. The FDX5 promoter region contains three GTAC motifs, which are known to be the binding sites for copper response regulator 1 (Crr1) and other SQUAMOSA promoter binding proteins (SBPs). This study shows that two of these GTAC sites are essential to confer oxygen and also copper responsiveness to a reporter gene. The SBP domain of Crr1 is able to bind to both of these GTAC sites in in vitro binding assays. Moreover, in a Crr1-deficient C. reinhardtii strain, FDX5 is not expressed. These results clearly indicate that Crr1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the FDX5 gene in the absence of oxygen or copper.",

However, O availability can be limited depending on the environment or developmental stage. Organisms react to hypoxic or anaerobic conditions by differential gene expression in order to adjust metabolic and biosynthetic pathways (26) . The unicellular eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a complex anaerobic metabolism (10, 19) , which is accompanied by the differential expression of many genes (25, 29) . Among these genes are transcripts encoding fermentative enzymes like HydA1 (FeFe-hydrogenase) (8) and Pfl1 (pyruvate formate lyase) (10) or enzymes that need O as a substrate for certain steps in biosynthetic pathways such as Cpx1 (oxidative coproporphyrinogen oxidase 1) (33) or Crd1 (magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester aerobic oxidative cyclase) (34) .",

By analyzing algal transformants carrying the CRLUC gene under the control of the putative FDX5 promoter, we could identify two critical GTAC motifs that are essential for the transcriptional activation of the FDX5 gene. The SBP domain of C. reinhardtii Crr1 is able to bind these GTAC cores, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Eventually, we confirmed that FDX5 is a strict Crr1 target by showing that a Crr1-deficient C. reinhardtii strain is not able to accumulate FDX5 transcripts or the Fdx5 protein.",

In C. reinhardtii, transformants carrying the CRLUC gene under the control of larger parts of the FDX5 promoter than those present in CL24 (up to 1,549 bp, including an additional GTAC motif at position \u03ea359) did not exhibit significantly higher RLU values (data not shown).

Therefore, mRNA was isolated from 10 to 15 individual transformants of each library and used to analyze CRLUC transcription by RT-PCR (Fig. 2b) .

SBP domains harbor a zinc finger domain that is known to interact with the GTAC motif of DNA (2) . It was shown previously that the SBP domain of Crr1 binds to the functionally defined (33) CuREs of CPX1 and CYC6 (16) . We analyzed whether the SBP domain of Crr1 can also bind to the two proximal GTAC motifs within the FDX5 upstream region described above to be essential for FDX5 promoter activity. By using the heterologously produced Crr1 SBP domain, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted with digoxigeninlabeled 36-bp fragments of the FDX5 promoter, including the two proximal GTAC motifs either intact or mutated to ACTG or TAGA (Fig. 3a) . The labeled FDX5 promoter fragments were incubated in the presence or in the absence of 200 ng of a heterologously produced Crr1 SBP domain. No retardation of the fragments could be observed in the absence of the SBP domain (Fig. 3b, lanes 1 to 4) . However, the incubation of a fragment of the putative FDX5 promoter including the two proximal (positions \u03ea96 and \u03ea74) GTAC motifs (construct I) ( Fig. 3a) with the Crr1 SPB domain resulted in two shifted bands of the digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotides (Fig. 3b,  lane 5) . The fragments carrying only one intact GTAC site (constructs II and III) (Fig. 3a) showed a single band shift, independently of which of the two GTAC motifs was present (Fig. 3b, lanes 6 and 7) . The mutation of both GTAC motifs (construct IV) ( Fig. 3a) prevented the retardation of the fragment (Fig. 3b, lane 8) .",

The asterisks above the CuRE symbols in the CYC6 scheme indicate that both sites are able to confer Cu responsiveness individually. the CPX1 promoter have been analyzed in detail. In contrast to the Cu response, a single CuRE is not sufficient for an enhanced expression of a reporter gene under hypoxic conditions.

Several SBP domains have been shown to bind to GTAC motifs, and the SBP domain of Crr1 also binds an Arabidopsis thaliana promoter fragment, including a GTAC site, while on the other hand, a C. reinhardtii CYC6 promoter fragment can be retarded by SBP domains from Arabidopsis and Physcomitrella (2) . At least seven genes that putatively encode SBP domain proteins have been detected in the C. reinhardtii genomic sequence (7) . However, the hypothesis that the FDX5 gene is under the transcriptional control of the Crr1 protein was confirmed by the fact that a C. reinhardtii crr1 mutant strain does not show any detectable accumulation of FDX5 transcripts or the Fdx5 protein. Thus, FDX5 is clearly regulated by Crr1 in response to Cu and O limitation.",

Cu is less soluble and bioavailable under anaerobic conditions, so the evolution of one signaling pathway to react to these two coupled conditions might make physiological sense (3) . The proteins encoded by the known Cu-and hypoxia-responsive genes have specific functions in Cu or in O 2 deficiency but not always obviously in both. While the role of the Cyc6 protein is evident in Cu-depleted C. reinhardtii cells, where it replaces the Cu protein plastocyanin (20) , a role of Cyc6 under anaerobic conditions is not known. The same is true for copper transporters like Ctr1 (30) . Cpx1 is involved in heme biosynthesis, which might be enhanced to provide a sufficient amount of heme as the cofactor of Cyc6 (12) . On the other hand, the enhanced expression of the CPX1 and CRD1 genes under hypoxic conditions (23, 24, 34) might be an attempt to scavenge O 2 molecules, since both encoded enzymes are O 2 dependent.",

(a and c) Average luciferase activities in RLU (relative luminescence units) for S-and Cu-deprived C. reinhardtii transformants carrying the respective chimeric constructs. Bars indicate standard deviations, and n indicates the number of individual transformants analyzed for each library. (a) Luciferase activity in S-depleted cells. In the cases of CL24 and CL27, only the luminescent transformants (numbers in parentheses) were included in the calculation. (b) Transcript analysis of CRLUC via RT-PCR using mRNA of C. reinhardtii transformants that had been subjected to anaerobic conditions by N 2 flushing in the dark. The results shown are representative of three individual strains of each construct library. mRNA isolated from strain CC-125 served as an untransformed control, and mRNA from CL20 (in which CRLUC is promoterless) served as the background control. Each RNA sample was also tested for FDX5 transcript accumulation to verify the physiological status of the cells and RNA quality. (c) Average luciferase activity in Cu-deficient C. reinhardtii transformants. In the case of strains carrying CL24 and CL27, the activities of four individual luminescent strains were measured. Forty individual strains of each library, CL31, CL36, and CL41, were analyzed.

Products synthesized via such pathways are collectively called oxylipins, and the multi-step processes involved are often initiated by lipoxygenases (LOXs) [2] . In general, LOXs constitute a large gene family of nonheme iron containing fatty acid dioxygenases, which are ubiquitous in higher plants and animals [3] . In fact, they can serve as the catalyst for regioand stereo-specific insertion of molecular oxygen into PUFAs containing one or more (1Z, 4Z)-pentadiene system, e.g., linoleic acid (LA), a-linolenic acid (ALA), arachidonic acid (AA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), resulting in the formation of (2E, 4Z)-hydroperoxy diene fragment [4] .",

                "text": "The biosynthesis of oxylipins is different for higher plants, mammals and algae. For instance, C18 PUFAs are the most common substrates for LOX enzymes in higher plants [5] , while C20 PUFAs are predominant substrates for LOXs in mammals and invertebrate animals [3] . The activity of LOXs can be classified according to the positional specificity of oxygenation for PUFAs. In higher plants, the catalytic insertion of oxygen either takes place at the carbon atom C-9 or C-13 of the hydrocarbon backbone, which leads to the formation of 9-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid (HpOTE) or 13-HpOTE [6] . In mammals, however, AA can be oxygenated by LOXs at six different positions: C-5, C-8, C-9, C-11, C-12 or C-15 [7] . Marine algae live in a complex seawater environment. Like higher plants and mammals, algae can also produce variety of oxylipins served as chemical defense signals [8] . Based on the oxylipin structures identified so far, it was determined that marine algae probably contain 5-, 8-, 9-, 12-, and 15-LOXs that can act on eicosanoic (C20) PUFAs, as well as \u03c93-, \u03c96-, \u03c99-, and \u03c910-LOXs that can act on octadecanoids (C18) [9] . However, till now, very limited information is available on the enzymes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of those compounds, but only two genes encoding LOX have been identified in Chondrus crispus, which is surprising considering the diverse oxylipins observed in mairne algae [10] .",

However, no information is available about the LOX enzymes responsible for synthesis of oxylipins in P. haitanensis. We have obtained the full sequences of two LOX genes from P. haitanensis (PhLOX and PhLOX2). PhLOX is still under investigation. In this study, we reported the identification, cloning, heterologous expression, and functional characterization of PhLOX2 from P. haitanenresis. The multiple enzymatic activities of PhLOX2 raise interesting questions about the role of this enzyme in the formation of diverse oxylipins.",

The alignment of amino acid sequence for PhLOX2, PhLOX and PpLOX is shown in Fig. 1 . Specifically, a low sequence similarity was found within the N-terminal portion of the protein, which was directed to the SRPBCC (START/ RHOalphaC/PITP/Bet v1/CoxG/CalC) superfamily. It has a deep hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket and can bind diverse ligands. Included in this superfamily are the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer (START) domains of mammalian STARD1-STARD15, and the C-terminal catalytic domains of the alpha oxygenase subunit of Rieske-type non-heme iron aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenases (RHOs_alpha_C), as well as the SRPBCC domains of phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs). While all the other known LOXs have an N-terminal PLAT domain, which is used to direct the protein to the membrane [12] . The LOX from P. haitanisis lacks this part of the protein, but its C-terminal domain consisting primarily of \u03b1-helices and containing the catalytic sites of the enzyme exhibits similarity to other LOXs. Especially the central histidine-rich region around His-585, His-590, His-774, Asn-778 and Ile-899, which are involved in iron binding within the active site, are highly conserved ( Fig. 1, marked by asterisks) .",

The phylogenetic tree of LOX separates the plant, red algae, and animal enzymes and forms several subgroups within each kingdom, indicating that the three branches should have the common ancestral LOX. It is obvious that LOXs from red algae form a distinct group and belong to a separate branch of the tree, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . The LOX from a marine bacterium Shewanella violacea DSS12 is closely related to this branch, and it contains the same N-terminal SRPBCC domain as Pyropia and Porphyra.

Fig. 4A showed the UV absorbance of EPA that was being converted in the presence of PhLOX2 catalyst, in which the highest activity for PhLOX2 was found at pH 8.0, and the catalytic reaction turned out to be fairly fast under this condition. The activity dramatically decreased when pH was above 8.0. When the pH is lower than 8.0, the enzyme is also quite active; as a matter of fact, we observed that the absorbance showed two peaks at pH 6.0 and pH 8.0, respectively at 12 min. Because all products containing -OH or -OOH functional groups exhibit an UV absorption peak at 235 nm, when the products are composed of a mixture of compounds with -OH and -OOH functional groups, the sole measurement of UV absorption at 235 nm may not reflect the pH effect on the individual enzyme activity that is required for the formation of different products. For PhLOX2, these results clearly suggest that the reaction pathways and factors affecting enzyme activity may be fairly complicated. Therefore, we analyzed the products generated from the Fig. 4B revealed that no difference is evident between the products generated under two pH conditions. The three main oxylipins including 8-HpEPE, 8-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE) and 9, 12-diHpEPE have been observed in these two spectra, but the height of each peak seems to be different. The product contents under pH 8.0 were higher than the ones under pH 6, indicating that pH should not affect the catalytic mode, but the activity of PhLOX2. However, the intrinsic reason why the absorbance at 235 nm decreased between pH 6.5-7.5 is still not clear.",

For substrates EPA and DHA, it appeared that two reaction stages were present, and the reaction rate for the first stage was fairly high (Fig. 5A) . In fact, the reaction reached its first high point in min, and the maximum absorption was obtained around 7 min. For substrates AA and GLA, the UV absorption seemed to slowly increase at the beginning of the reaction, and the latter achieved its maximum absorption at 8 min. Therefore, we conclude that PhLOX2 can utilize EPA and DHA faster and more efficiently. We also determined the optimal substrate of PhLOX2 by kinetic analysis. The kinetic characterization of PhLOX2 was carried out with four substrates, GLA, AA, EPA and DHA. The kinetic constants K m and K cat are reported in Table 1 . The lowest K m value was recorded with EPA, and this indicates that PhLOX2 has the highest affinity for EPA and is particularly active towards EPA. The K m value was the highest when GLA was used as the substrate. The K cat /K m values show that EPA was most efficiently catalyzed by PhLOX2, and GLA showed the lowest K cat /K m value. It should be noted that the K cat values for other substrates differed significantly with that of K m . Although the K m of DHA was lower than AA and GLA, it showed the lowest K cat . Considering that the hydroperoxy products formed are further metabolized into hydroxy-, dihydroperoxy fatty acids, the composition and proportion in the products may different remarkably. This fact might be the molecular basis for the different kinetic parameters. These data support that EPA was the optimal substrate for PhLOX2; in fact, GLA was a poor substrate.",

The disappearance of PUFAs by incubation with the purified protein in comparison with the control was measured by LC-MS. Notably, the results showed that PhLOX2 can catalyze C18, C20 and C22 fatty acids. For C20 fatty acids, EPA and AA turned out to be the main substrates converted (90.97% and 88.43%, respectively). In contrast, the conversion of GLA and DHA was much less, which was 79.21% and 46.26%, respectively (Fig. 5B ). Such preference in substrate utilization is consistent with the results obtained from other red algae. For red algae, C20 PUFAs (AA and EPA) and C18 PUFAs (LA and ALA) have been employed as substrates, and the most prominent theme in red algal oxylipin biosynthesis seems to be the metabolism of C-20 PUFAs [4] . In addition, these results are in agreement with the previous findings involving the response of P. haitanensis to agaro-oligosaccharides, in which AA and EPA are the main precursors for the structurally diverse, unsaturated aldehydes and alcohols [11] . By comparing these results with the data illustrated in Fig. 5A and the kinetic characterization of PhLOX2, we found that EPA exhibited the highest degree of utilization and conversion rate. As shown in Fig. 5B , AA also manifested high degree of utilization; however, only 46.26% DHA was consumed. Based on the absorption at 235 nm as shown in Fig. 5A , the consumption of DHA was extremely fast and the 235 nm UV absorption reached a fairly high value, whereas that of AA was low. This discrepancy indicated that DHA is not the preferred substrate for PhLOX2 in the presence of other substrates, and the catalytic conversion of DHA may only high efficiently proceed when it is used alone. Alternatively, PhLOX2 may catalyze the conversion of AA and DHA to produce monohydroperoxy, di-hydroperoxy and hydroxyl compounds at different ratio. Because the absorptions of those products at 235 nm are different, even DHA was consumed less than 50%, the resulting absorbance at this wavelength may still fairly strong.",

                "text": "The catalytic activity of PhLOX2 against LA, ALA, GLA, AA, EPA and DHA has been closely examined with the assistance of LC and high resolution mass spectrometry analyses, as shown in Table 2 . We found that PhLOX2 showed no activity to LA and ALA. Specifically, results obtained from the in vitro biochemical analysis revealed that the PhLOX2 protein possesses broad substrate tolerance, and it can metabolize fatty acids with chain lengths of C20, C22 and also \u03b3-C18:3, affording hydroperoxy and hydroxyl fatty acids containing different positional isomers. This is in accordance with the presence of a large number of structurally different oxylipins found in other red algae [13] . These diverse oxylipins can be generated by a few catalytic enzymes, which in a way explaining how sophisticated functions can be achieved in red algae with a simple genome. In contrast, mammals and higher plants only use C20 or C18 fatty acids as reaction substrates, respectively. Furthermore, C18 fatty acids used by higher plant LOXs and PhLOX2 are different. PhLOX2 shows selectivity towards C18 fatty acids and only catalyzes the conversion of \u03b3-linolenic acid, but most of higher plants prefer to convert \u03b1-LA, only the LOX enzyme in Physcomitrella patens has been reported to catalyze transformation of \u03b3-linolenic acid substrate to form the major product 10-\u03b3HpOTE [2] . Fig. 7 shows the PhLOX2-catalyzed pathways based on the different types of hydroperoxy and hydroxyl compounds detected. Particularly, the structural types for the products obtained from PhLOX2 catalyzed reactions are fairly diverse, including mono-hydroperoxy, dihydroperoxy and hydroxyl products, revealing it to be an unconventional LOX with no strictly positional specificities but some catalytic rules. Multiple catalytic sites are available, such as 6-/9-/13-lipoxygenase against GLA; 8-/9-/12-lipoxygenase against AA and EPA; and 4-/7-/10-/ 14-/20-lipoxygenase against DHA. Notably, GLA is mainly converted to 9-hydroxy-7,9,12octadecatrienoic acid (9-HOTE), which has been identified as a 9-LOX product. Meanwhile, the 6-LOX activity (6-HpOTE) against GLA has also been detected, yet it is not evident in other higher plants and mammals. These activities might suggest that substrate binding in the active site of PhLOX2 was more flexible in comparison with other LOXs. Although both LOXs in higher plants and PhLOX2 can utilize C18 fatty acids as substrates to produce 9-or 13-hydroperoxides, the LOX enzymes in higher plants usually use \u03b1-linolenic acid as the substrate to form the biologically active oxylipins such as Jasmonic acid. In contrast, the PhLOX2 enzyme can only catalyze the reaction of \u03b3-linolenic acid in P. haitanensis, and the function of resulting downstream products is still unclear. When C20 PUFAs were employed, the 8-LOX activity has been observed in both P. haitanensis and animals. 8-LOX is one of the several LOXs expressed in mouse epidermis, and its occurrence is barely detectable in normal skin cells, whereas it is highly expressed in phorbol ester-treated hyperproliferative epidermis of various mouse strains [14] . In corals, it was suggested that prostaglandin-like molecules could be produced from 8-hydroperoxy eicosatetraenoic acid (HpETE) by enzyme mediated reactions [15] . In addition, it is possible that the synthesis of prostaglandins in red algae Glacilaria verrucosa [16] and Glacilaria lichenoids [17] could proceed through a similar pathway, in which 8-HPETE is involved in the biosynthesis. As shown in Fig. 7 , both 8-HpEPE and 8-HpETE have been detected in P. haitanensis, strongly suggesting that red algae should contain a functional 8-LOX system. In P. haitanensis, however, no prostaglandins were detected or reported. Meanwhile, rather than the commonly expected hydroperoxy compounds, 8-LOX in PhLOX2 can further catalyze the conversion of 8-HpEPE and 8-HpETE to generate hydroxyl products (8-hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 8-HEPE), as shown in Fig. 7 . Therefore, the exact function of 8-LOX in this alga is still unclear. Further analysis revealed the presence of several unusual hydroperoxy products when DHA was used as substrate, such as 7-HpDHE and 10-HpDHE which are not reported in the literatures. The formation of these mono-hydroperoxy products suggested that free radicals should be initiated at two specific locations on the fatty acid backbone chain, specifically, the carbon atom between the first double bond and the second double bond, or the one between the second double bond and the third double bond, as marked by red dots in Fig. 7 . However, in DHA, the carbon atom between the third and the fourth double bond was also attached to form 10-HpDHE, plus, the double bonds are closer to the carboxylic acid in DHA than other PUFAs, therefore, the oxygenation position may be closer to the front, depending on the substrate inserting position in the active site pocket. Furthermore, we noticed that except the 13-HpOTE of GLA, the -OOH group of other mono-hydroperoxy compounds are all in the vicinity of carboxylic acids at (n-2) position. The PhLOX2 enzyme has demonstrated its signature characteristics, which is the requirement of triple ethylenic bonds, consistent with the fact that PhLOX2 did not shown activity to LA. The distance from ethylenic bond to carboxylic group could affect the position of hydrogen abstraction in substrates, therefore, because PhLOX2 showed activity to \u03b3-linolenic acid, but not to \u03b1-linolenic acid, we conclude that although the substrate binding in the active site of PhLOX2 could be flexible, certain structural requirement for substrates are still needed.",

                "text": "Besides mono-hydroperoxy products, certain di-hydroperoxy products can also be generated from the PhLOX2 catalyzed reactions, such as 9,12-di-HpETE from AA; 9,12-di-HpEPE from EPA; 7,14-di-HpDHE and 4,20-di-HpDHE from DHA ( Table 2 , Fig. 7) . Such \"double dioxygenation\" properties have also been reported in a few LOXs, including the soy LOX1, wheat seed LOX, and rice seed LOX-2, which can be employed to convert AA to a mixture of 5,15and 8,15-diHpETE [18] . It appears that four ethylenic bonds are required for the formation of di-hydroperoxy products from polyunsaturated fatty acids; therefore, no di-oxygenation product was formed when GLA was employed as the substrate. Based on the reaction site of hydroperoxylation, it was hard to summarize rules. The generation of di-hydroperoxy products may not go through the two-step pathway, and some researchers have proposed a forward-inverse subsequent entry theory, in which the production of di-hydroperoxides is mediated by soybean LOX-1 capable of catalyzing 15, 5, and 8-LOX reactions. In this theory, the initial oxygenation reaction to form 15-HpETE is followed by its reverse orientation (\"flip\"), and then by 5 or 8 oxygenation to produce 5,15-di-HpETE or 8,15-di-HpETE. Consequently, 15-HpETE can be detected in the products obtained [19] . However, in our work, no 9-and 12-mono-hydroperoxy compounds from AA and EPA, or 4-mono-hydroperoxide from DHA were detected, instead, only 7-HpDHE was found, which may be the reactive precursor for 7,14-diHpDHE. In order to demonstrate this hypothesis, we purified 7-HpDHE and used it as substrate. We found 7, 14-diHpDHE was formed (Fig. 8A) , which indicated that di-hydroperoxy products should be derived from mono-hydroperoxide by enzymatic reaction. The missing of mono-hydroperoxide precursor for other di-hydroperoxy products could be due to fact that the second reaction step is unusually fast, which could prevent the detection of the products from the first reaction step. To verify this hypothesis, structural modeling of the enzyme/substrate complex needs to be performed. For AA and EPA, the oxygenation positions are the same, and hydrogen abstraction occurs at carbon atoms C-7 and C-10, plus, molecular oxygens can insert into position (n+2), ultimately forming the di-hydroperoxy products 9,12-diHpETE and 9,12-diHpEPE.",

                "text": "The origin of hydroxy compounds varies, but the most common one seems to be the reduction of hydroperoxy intermediates [15] . Moreover, some products are generated via enzyme-catalyzed processes, in which certain hydroperoxy intermediates can be converted to mono-hydroxy products in the presence of peroxidase. For instance, 9-HETE in Polyneura latissima has been postulated to be originated from the peroxidase activity [22] . It is known that purified prostaglandin hydroperoxidase from bovine vesicular gland microsomes can convert prostaglandin G1 to prostaglandin H1 [23] . Additionally, di-hydroxy products can be obtained with the assistance of linoeate diol synthase (LDS) or PpOA (a putative oxylipin producing oxygenase). Specifically, it was reported that LA can be converted to 7,8-di-hydroxy octadecaenoic acid (diHODE) in Gaeumannomyces graminis by LDS [24] [25] [26] , and the generation of 5,8-diHODE from LA in Aspergillus nidulans has been achieved by PpOA. Notably, these enzymes all possess single catalytic activity, but the enzyme PhLOX2 appears to be a dual function molecule, because it serves as both lipoxygenase and hydroperoxidase. In 1997, Koljak et al. reported a peroxidase-lipoxygenase fusion protein from coral Plexaura homomalla, and it can convert arachidonic acids to allene oxides [27] , which is the first example of LOX exhibiting peroxidase activity. In addition, catalase like allene oxide synthase-LOX fusion proteins has been disclosed in Cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina [28] , Anabaena PCC7120 [29] and coral P. homomalla [30, 31] . However, these dual function proteins are fundamentally different from PhLOX2, because they are essentially constructed by fusing two functional domains together. In contrast, PhLOX2 is a single domain protein exhibiting both hydroperoxidase and lipoxygenase functions. Besides, the products formed are also not the same, because the fusion proteins are generally involved in the formation of allene oxides, and PhLOX2 serves as the catalyst for the production of mono-hydroxy fatty acids. Moreover, peroxidase, hydroperoxidases, catalase-like allene oxide synthase and LDS are all heme-dependent enzymes, whereas PhLOX2 is not, even though it has hydroperoxidase activity. Interestingly, Brodhun et al. found that a fungal FoxLOX, a non-heme iron lipoxygenase in Fusarium oxysporum, also exhibits multifunctional activity by oxidizing C18-polyunsaturated fatty acids to 13S-hydroperoxy derivatives. With \u03b1-linolenic acid as the substrate, the hydroperoxy derivatives formed by FoxLOX are further converted to dihydroxy-, keto-, and epoxy alcohol derivatives [32] , which were similar to PhLOX2. The intrinsic mechanism involved in the enzyme-catalyzed hydroxylation is not clear yet, but meaningful information still can be gathered by comparing the hydroxy products obtained. Because the products derived from LA and ALA were not evident, it is unlikely that PhLOX2 can catalyze the conversion of C18 PUFAs, but it should show decent activity for the conversion of C20 or C22 PUFAs. The selection of hydroxylation site seems to follow certain rules, and the hydrogen residing on the carbon atom between the second and third double bond next to the carbonyl acid motif should be the one abstracted, such as C-11 in GLA, C-10 in AA or EPA, and C-9 in DHA. Molecular oxygen is introduced at the position (n-2), leading to the formation of 9-HOTE for GLA, 8-HETE for AA, 8-HEPE for EPA and 7-HDHE for DHA. Similar to the mono-hydroxyperoxide of DHA (10-HpDHE), we have observed the presence of 10-HDHE, which does not obey the rule mentioned above. Overall, these results could be correlated with the structure activity relationship between enzyme and substrates.",

In the present study, as the pivotal enzyme to synthesize oxylipins, the increased PhLOX2 expression was observed following oligoagars stimulation and damage treatment for 1 h (Fig. 9 ), but the damage induced more striking increase of PhLOX2 expression. In 10 min, the level increased to 18.48-fold, and it reached the maximum expression of 37.59-fold at 20 min. Oligoagars also induced the expression of PhLOXs. At 20 min, the level of PhLOX2 was increased by 7.2-fold. In the previous research on the response of P. haitanensis to desiccation, we found that expression of PhLOX2 showed remarkable gene expression increase after 4 h desiccation, an 8.7-fold increase comparing with that of the control [35] .

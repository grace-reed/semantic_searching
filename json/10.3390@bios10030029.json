    "abstract": "Fluorescent proteins exhibit fluorescence quenching by specific transition metals, suggesting their potential as fluorescent protein-based metal biosensors. Each fluorescent protein exhibits unique spectroscopic properties and mechanisms for fluorescence quenching by metals. Therefore, the metal-induced fluorescence quenching analysis of various new fluorescent proteins would be important step towards the development of such fluorescent protein-based metal biosensors. Here, we first report the spectroscopic and structural analysis of the yellow fluorescent protein ZsYellow, following its metal-induced quenching. Spectroscopic analysis showed that ZsYellow exhibited a high degree of fluorescence quenching by Cu 2+. During Cu 2+-induced ZsYellow quenching, fluorescence emission was recovered by adding EDTA. The crystal structure of ZsYellow soaked in Cu 2+ solution was determined at a 2.6 \u00c5 resolution. The electron density map did not indicate the presence of Cu 2+ around the chromophore or the \u03b2-barrel surface, which resulted in fluorescence quenching without Cu 2+ binding to specific site in ZsYellow. Based on these results, we propose the fluorescence quenching to occur in a distance-dependent manner between the metal and the fluorescent protein, when these components get to a closer vicinity at higher metal concentrations. Our results provide useful insights for future development of fluorescent proteinbased metal biosensors.",

                "text": "Fluorescent proteins are optical probes that are useful in cell and molecular biology for tracking target molecules [1] [2] [3] . Fluorescent proteins have been widely used to study the localization of target molecules and molecular interactions (e.g., protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid) in living cells using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) [1, [4] [5] [6] . Moreover, the highly sensitive fluorescent properties of fluorescent proteins have been utilized in vitro to monitor the expression level of membrane proteins [7, 8] . A number of fluorescence characteristics of fluorescent proteins have already been reported in various application fields and their potential is far from being fully discovered [2, 4, [9] [10] [11] . One interesting optical property of fluorescent proteins is that their fluorescence intensity changes depending on the external factors, such as pH or the presence of metal ions [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The fluorescence quenching of fluorescent proteins by transition metal ions suggests their potential role as metal biosensors [12, 13, 19] . To elucidate the molecular mechanism behind their metal-induced fluorescence quenching and to utilize them as a metal biosensors, various fluorescent proteins such as eGFP, DsRed, mEmerald, Dronpa, AmCyan, and mOrange, have been already investigated [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 20, 21] . Most fluorescent proteins exhibited a high degree of fluorescence quenching by Cu 2+ in a highly selective, reversible, and sensitive manner [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Fluorescence quenching by transition metal ions is induced by static quenching, energy transfer between a colored metal ion and the chromophore, or perturbations of the protein structure [15, [22] [23] [24] . In order to understand the effector mechanism of metal ion-induced fluorescence quenching, several fluorescent protein-metal ion complex crystal structures have been determined [15, 16, 25] . Metal ions can be bound to fluorescent proteins in two ways. First, as for BFPms1, the metal ion is directly bound to the chromophore through the engineered metal binding site within the \u03b2-barrel [25] . Second, the metal ion is bound to histidine residues outside the \u03b2-barrel as seen in mEmerald or Dronpa [15, 16] . In the latter case, two or more histidine residues are required to coordinate the metal ion. Although the above-mentioned studies point out the potential of fluorescent protein-based metal biosensors, further information is required on metal ion-induced fluorescent protein quenching prior to any practical applications.",

We determined the crystal structure of ZsYellow immersed in Cu 2+ at a 2.6 \u00c5 resolution. The electron density map did not indicate the presence of Cu 2+ , suggesting that Cu 2+ quenched ZsYellow in a non-invasive manner. Our crystallographic results suggest a new kind of metal-induced fluorescence quenching of fluorescent protein.

                "text": "Fluorescent proteins generally exhibit fluorescence quenching in the presence of divalent metal ions, however, the efficiency of fluorescence quenching varies depending on the type of metal and the fluorescent protein [16, 17] . In order to find a specific metal ion for quenching ZsYellow fluorescence, we screened various metal ions using Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ , Zn 2+ , and Cd 2+ . To avoid non-specific metal binding to ZsYellow, we removed the N-terminal hexahistidine tag during protein purification. To verify the purified ZsYellow, we examined the fluorescence spectra. The maximum peaks of excitation and emission wavelengths for ZsYellow were observed at 527 nm and 540 nm, respectively (Figure 1a) . When visually determined, Cu 2+ was only found to distinctively quench the fluorescence of ZsYellow as compared to other metal ions (Figure 1b) . Next, spectroscopic analysis was performed to further investigate into the metal-induced fluorescence quenching of ZsYellow (Figure 1c ). The fluorescence intensity of native ZsYellow was reduced by 81.4% with addition of Cu 2+ -the highest among all metals, which is consistent with the result in Figure 1b . Addition of Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ also significantly reduced the fluorescence intensity of ZsYellow by 21.1, 54.0, 35.2, 25.9 and 32.1%, respectively (Figure 1c) . Moreover, Li + , Na + , Ca 2+ and Ce 2+ also caused a modest reduction in the ZsYellow fluorescence intensity by 11.22, 7.49, 14.32, and 3.51%, respectively (data not shown). The results indicate that the fluorescence of ZsYellow showed highest sensitivity to Cu 2+ among the metals tested. Next, we performed a Cu 2+ titration experiment with ZsYellow ( Figure 2 ). By adding 0.2, 0.8, and 3.2 mM of Cu 2+ solution, which are approximately 900, 3600, or 14400 times higher concentrations than that of ZsYellow, the fluorescence intensities of apo-ZsYellow were reduced by 35.0, 69.2, and 81.1%, respectively (Figure 2a ). The maximum fluorescence quenching was achieved with 6.4 mM of Cu 2+ , which was 28800 times higher concentration of that of ZsYellow and there was no further fluorescence quenching observed with higher Cu 2+ concentrations. Previously, the fluorescence of quenched fluorescent proteins has been recovered by adding chelating agents such as EDTA [16, 17] . It is important to investigate into fluorescence recovery of fluorescent proteins for their reuse as metal-biosensors. Therefore, we performed an experiment for the fluorescence reversibility of ZsYellow using EDTA. When different concentrations of EDTA ranging from 0 to 50 mM were added to quenched ZsYellow by Cu 2+ , its fluorescence intensities were only slightly recovered until with 6.4 mM of EDTA. However, the addition of higher concentrations of EDTA at 25 and 50 mM resulted in high fluorescence recovery of 80.0 and 90.2%, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that Cu 2+ -induced fluorescence quenching of ZsYellow can be recovered by EDTA and that higher amount of EDTA than that of Cu 2+ is required to achieve the high recovery of ZsYellow fluorescence (i.e. > 90%).

                "text": "To identify how Cu 2+ ions quench ZsYellow, we performed X-ray crystallography. We initially hypothesized that Cu 2+ , which acts as the quencher, could be bound to ZsYellow, as previously reported for iq-mEmerald and Dronpa [15, 16] . To obtain ZsYellow complexed with Cu 2+ , we attempted crystallizing ZsYellow after incubation with Cu 2+ . However, ZsYellow immediately precipitated when Cu 2+ was added and the yellow color of the solution disappeared. Next, we carried out the crystallization of ZsYellow by supplementing the reservoir solution with Cu 2+ , but here also it precipitated and the yellow color disappeared. However, in this case microcrystals of ZsYellow appeared under precipitate after a week, even though the crystal size was not sufficiently large for X-ray diffraction. Next, we introduced Cu 2+ at a final concentration of 10 mM in the crystallization drop containing ZsYellow crystals. After 1 min of incubation, the yellowish color of ZsYellow crystal faded. Subsequently, the crystal was immersed in cryoprotectant and used for X-ray diffraction. However, the diffraction quality was poor. Finally, in order to collect data immediately after Cu 2+induced discoloration of ZsYellow crystal, we added an additional 10 mM Cu 2+ to the cryoprotectant solution. Upon undergoing discoloration, the ZsYellow crystal was mounted using a nylon loop under a stream of nitrogen at 100 K (Figure 3a ) and X-ray diffraction data was collected. ZsYellow crystal immersed in Cu 2+ belonged to the orthorhombic space group P21221, with a = 48.638, b = 72.929, and c = 124.189, containing two ZsYellow molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final model was refined to 2.6 \u00c5 resolution with Rwork and Rfree of 20.60 and 21.50%, respectively. ZsYellow immersed in Cu 2+ shows the typical \u03b2-barrel fold with the chromophore located near the center of the \u03b2-barrel (Figure 3b ). The chromophore of ZsYellow consists of a tripeptide (Lys66, Gly68, and Tyr67), which constitutes a three ring system formed by the hetero-cyclization of Lys66 (Figure 3c ). As a result, the backbone between Phe65 and Lys66 is cleaved, consistent with previous reports for zFP538 and ZsYellow [18, 34, 35] . Further, we examined the Fo-Fc electron density map to identify Cu 2+ binding sites. Interestingly, although the ZsYellow crystal had been quenched by Cu 2+ , we did not observe a Fo-Fc electron density map (> 5\u03c3) for Cu 2+ (Figure 3b ). We compared maps for native ZsYellow and ZsYellow immersed in Cu 2+ , but an electron density map that could be attributed to Cu 2+ was not observed. Moreover, ZsYellow and ZsYellow immersed in Cu 2+ showed high structural similarity with a r.m.s. deviation of 0.198-0.239 \u00c5 for whole C\u03b1 atoms. On the other hand, we observed structural differences were present in cyclized Lys66 of the chromophore (Figure 3d ). Crystal structure of Cu 2+ -immersed ZsYellow.

In Dronpa-Co 2+ , Co 2+ is coordinated by His194 and His212, whereas in ZsYellow Lys203 and His222 are located at the same position (Figure  4c and 4d) . ZsYellow has no similarity with the metal binding site of iq-mEmerald, whereas His212 of Dronpa is in the same structural position as ZsYellow His222. This information can potentially be useful for engineering a ZsYellow metal binding site. We also investigated the electron density map around His or Asp residues that could potentially bind Cu 2+ to the \u03b2-barrel surface, however, a reliable electron density map was not observed (Figure 3b ). Although ZsYellow fluorescence was quenched by Cu 2+ , a reliable electron density map was not obtained for Cu 2+ , suggesting that Cu 2+ can quench ZsYellow fluorescence without binding to it. ",

Although fluorescence of ZsYellow crystals was quenched by Cu 2+ , electron density map for Cu 2+ was not observed in the crystal structure, which suggests that fluorescence quenching occurs without Cu 2+ binding to ZsYellow. Crystallographic studies related to fluorescence quenching by metals have already been previously reported, as in case of the fluorescent protein BFPms1 [25] , iq-Emerald [15] , or Dronpa [16] . In BFPms1, the mutagenesis of His148 to Gly114 formed solvent-accessible channels with cross-dimensions of approximately 3.4 \u00d7 6.4 \u00c5 between the \u03b27-and \u03b28-strands on the surface of the \u03b2-barrel (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Using this channel, Cu 2+ or Zn 2+ could access and interact with the BFPms1 chromophore. Cu 2+ and Zn 2+ play a role in fluorescence quenching and fluorescence intensity enhancement, respectively. In the superimposed structures of BFPms1 and ZsYellow, such solvent-accessible channels cannot be observed in the ZsYellow surface structure ( Figure S1 ). Concerning the two other above-mentioned fluorescent proteins, iq-Emerald has two engineered histidines on the \u03b2-barrel surface, while Dronpa natively contains histidine residues on its \u03b2-barrel surface. Both these fluorescent proteins bind transition metals to their histidine residues. In case of ZsYellow, there are no such identical interaction sites with two histidine residues that could recognize and bind metals (Figure 4) . As a result, ZsYellow must acquire a different effector mechanism for metal-induced fluorescence quenching than the already described processes in case of the aforementioned fluorescent proteins.",

Crystal structure of iq-mEmerald shows that the distance between the metal ion and the closest and farthest atom on the chromophore is 10.8 and 20.3 \u00c5, respectively [15] . These results indicate that fluorescence quenching of fluorescent proteins can occur if the metal is close to the chromophore. Based on the crystal structure, we conclude that Cu 2+ does not bind to a specific position on ZsYellow. However, fluorescence quenching is possible due to the increased concentration of Cu 2+ and the proximity of the metal ion to the ZsYellow chromophore ( Figure S2 ). Based on our crystal structure analysis, dynamic quenching could be possible, as no direct interaction has been observed between the chromophore and quencher like Cu 2+.",

The substitution of Thr220 and Lys203 with His, which can be binding partners around the His222 on the surface of ZsYellow, is expected to produce a quenchable metal binding site. In conclusion, ZsYellow is the first example of a fluorescent protein that undergoes fluorescence quenching without binding to Cu 2+ and will provide new insights into the development of fluorescent protein-based metal-biosensors. For an in-depth characterization, it is necessary to investigate if ZsYellow fluorescence quenching could be triggered by a wider variety of metals and chemicals, such as Cu + , Fe 2+ , heavy metals and reducing agents. In addition, it should be further investigated as well if specific metals could affect the absorption spectra of ZsYellow or potentially induce its aggregation.",

This protein has the highest fluorescence quenching triggered by Cu 2+ , similarly to previously described fluorescent proteins, such as BFPms1, iq-Emerald and Dronpa. However, BFPms1, iq-Emerald, and Dronpa interacts with Cu 2+ in a specific position, on the chromophore or \u03b2-barrel surface, resulting in fluorescence quenching. In contrast, our crystallographic results show that Cu 2+ can induce fluoresce quenching without binding to specific sites in ZsYellow. Based on the results of our spectroscopic and crystallographic analysis, we consider that ZsYellow has a low level of fluorescence quenching sensitivity to Cu 2+ , as Cu 2+ does not contain a site for a stable binding. However, as the concentration of Cu 2+ increases, the distance between Cu 2+ and the fluorescent protein chromophore gets reduced, and fluorescence quenching could thus occur without binding to a specific site. Our results not only provide new mechanisms for fluorescence quenching of fluorescent protein by Cu 2+ , but also provide new insights into the development of various fluorescent protein-based metal biosensor materials in the future.",

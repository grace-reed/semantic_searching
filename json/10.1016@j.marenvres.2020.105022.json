                "text": "Ocean acidification (OA) due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is a major environmental concern, with the potential to affect the marine ecosystem [1] [2] [3] . Several studies have highlighted a range of severe biological effects (growth, calcification, immune defense, etc.), on calcifying organisms such as corals and invertebrates [4, 5] . Although most fish can efficiently cope with an OAinduced acid-base disturbance thanks to ionic transport through specialized gill ionocytes, resulting physiological tradeoffs may induce numerous effects [6] [7] [8] [9] . Among them, impacts on neurosensory systems (olfaction, vision and hearing) were reported with alterations of several behavioural parameters (e.g. predation, orientation) that can affect individuals' fitness [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Even if these effects have been recently subjected to debates, the behavioural impact of OA is undoubtedly the most documented [16] . Increased calcification of otolith as well as metabolic shift is also sensitive endpoints induced by exposure of fish to OA [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Additionally but not finally, fewer studies suggest regulation of other physiological processes, such as the complement system (Bresolin de Souza et al., 2016) or the reproductive function [26] [27] [28] .",

Albeit these \"omics\" approaches have revealed unexplored potential effects on physiological processes, most of them are far to be completely understood [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Furthermore, the ecological implications of OA on fish species are uncertain since they depend on their potential for acclimation and adaptation to long term exposure to OA within and across generations [34] [35] [36] . Depending on phenotypic endpoints considered, some (e.g. behavioural impairment) persist while others (expression of genes) fluctuate within generation as a result of the exposure duration [11, 37, 38] . The potential for transgenerational acclimation depends on the species considered since literature reports several examples where exposure of parents to acidification has conferred or not benefits to their offspring [35, 39, 40] . It must be noted that information related to long term impact of OA exposure on marine fish species exhibiting long life cycle (>3years) is very scarce.",

Several phenotypical analyses were performed at different life stages revealing limited but significant effects of OA on parameters related to growth, development and digestive enzyme activities [41] [42] [43] . Surprisingly, the microarray approach performed at larval stage did not reveal any mRNA expression significantly regulated by OA [43] . Considering that the quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach generally showed greater dynamic range allowing detection of smaller changes in mRNA levels, we decided to investigate by dedicated qPCR approach the expression level of a mRNA corresponding to an Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) which tended to exhibit not statistically significant lower microarray hybridization signal in larvae exposed to pH7.6. This EST represented a cDNA sequence of a member of the C1q-domain-containing (C1qDC) protein family.",

We investigated expression profile of the transcript throughout larval development and among different tissues in fish reared in normal condition by qPCR, and we analysed its distribution in the olfactory rosette by means of in situ hybridization. We then compared the mRNA expression levels at larval and adult stages in two successive generations (F0 and F1) of European sea bass exposed to a water pH of 8.0 or 7.6.

Sea bass were maintained from larval to adult stage (four years post-hatching) in two pH/PCO2 conditions [i.e., PCO2 \u2248 \u00b5atm for the control group at pH total = 8; PCO 2 \u2248 1520 \u00b5atm for OA condition at pH total = 7.6]. The experimental conditions were chosen based on the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 6.0 and IPCC RCP8.5 scenario predicting a \u2206PCO2 of \u2248 500 \u00b5atm and \u2248 1000 \u00b5atm by the end of the present century, respectively [56] . The rearing conditions of F0 population throughout all life stages are detailed in the previous papers [38, 43] . Briefly, the seawater was pumped from a depth of 20 m approximately, 500 m from the coastline in the Bay of Brest, first filtered using a sand filter, heated, degassed using a column. Larvae were maintained at 19\u00b0C in triplicate tanks, with oxygen concentration around 95% air saturation, salinity at 34\u2030 and the controlled photoperiod was set at 16L:8D until 45 days post hatching (dph). Larvae were fed ad libitum with Artemia until 28 dph then with commercial feed (N\u00e9o-start, Le Gouessant Aquaculture, France) until 45 dph. From 45dph, fish were maintained at 18 \u00b0C and fed a commercial feed (Neo Grower Extra Marin, Le Gouessant Aquaculture, France). From 2 years post-hatching, fish from triplicate tanks were randomly split into duplicate tanks and reared under ambient temperature and natural photoperiod and fed a diet that meets the nutritional requirements of Broodstock (Vitalis Cal, Skretting, Stavanger, Norway). Apart from pH conditions, F0 fish from the two groups experienced identical experimental conditions throughout their different life stages. To produce a F1 generation, sperm and eggs were collected from 20 males and 6 females of each group. The eggs and sperm from each group were crossed separately to produce F1. The eggs were hatched and the resultant F1 fish were then maintained in the same pH condition (pH 8= control group; pH 7.6= OA group) as their parents. F1 fish from each group were reared in the same condition than F0 at different life stages. Before sampling, fish were fasted for 24 h. For sampling, fish were first lightly anesthetized (20 mg L\u22121), and then euthanized with a lethal dose (200 mg L\u22121) of tricaine methanesulfonate 222 (Pharmaq, Fordingbridge, Hampshire, UK). All fish tests were conducted under approved protocols in strict compliance with the EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments.

The analysis of cbln11C1q mRNA for all larval and adult samples was performed by qPCR using the following primers (forward primer: ATGGTCTACACGGTGATTCTC, reverse primer: CTACGACGGGAAGATGAGGA) ( Figure 1 ). The primer pair was designed using Primer 3 plus tool (http://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgibin/primer3plus/primer3plus.cgi). Standard curves were estimated for this primer pair using serial dilutions (from 1/5 to 1/40) of both a pool of whole larvae cDNA and cDNA from a mix of different tissues. Efficiency of qPCR ranged was around 100% with R2 > 0.999 for both standard curves. Two housekeeping genes [elongation factor 1-alpha (ef1\u03b1) and Ribosomal protein L13a] were tested for normalization of cbln11 mRNA using the following primers: EF1\u03b1 forward primer: CTGGAGGGCAGTGAAAAGAT, EF1\u03b1 reverse primer: CATCAAGAGCCTCCAGCAGT; L13a forward primer: TCTGGAGGACTGTCAGGGGCATGC, L13a reverse primer: AGACGCACAATCTTGAGAGCAG. Transcript expression was quantified using the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) and the protocol previously described [38] . The relative quantity of messenger was normalized with the \u0394\u0394Ct method using ef1\u03b1 and Ribosomal protein L13a as reference genes. These reference genes were used as their transcripts have an M value below 0.5 in our sample sets [63] . A one way ANOVA was used to test significant differences among normalized cbln11 mRNA expression levels. For all analyses, variables were checked for normality (Shapiro test) and equality of variances (Levene test). The level of significance was taken at 0.05.",

At larval stage, hybridization labelling was only observed in the apical part of the forming olfactory lamellae constituting the rosette (Figure 7 A) . At adult stage, double-label RNA ISH experiments using a mouse anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (Acetyl-Tub; clone, 6-11B-1; Reference T 6793, Sigma) as a marker of neurons revealed a high expression of the cbln11 mRNA in non-neuron cells lining the non-sensory epithelium at the basal and the apical parts of the olfactory lamellae (Figure 7 B-D) .

Interestingly, our microsynteny analysis revealed that this European sea bass sghC1q gene is the ortholog of zebrafish cbln11 gene. In zebrafish, cbln11 gene is located on chromosome 7, in a large DNA distance from 3 other clustered sghC1q genes (sghC1q16, sghC1q6 and sghC1q8) [58] . In total, twenty sghC1q genes have been identified and located in the genome of zebrafish [58] . A global synteny analysis dedicated on sghC1q genes in European sea bass will be necessary to determine if the two species share the same genomic organization of sghC1q genes. Interestingly, orthologs of cbln11 gene have only been identified in clupeocephala species. Additional in-depth studies will be necessary to confirm that other teleost species such as anguilliformes or osteoglossiformes orders and other vertebrate species including mammals really lack cbln11 gene orthologs.",

However, interestingly two studies based on the transcriptomic analysis of whole zebrafish larvae revealed that cbln11 gene expression was up-expressed in animals infected by bacteria suggesting that this gene may be involved in pathogen defense-associated pathways [65, 66] . This role would be in agreement with the known antibacterial and immuno-regulatory properties of several C1qDC proteins in marine organisms including fish species [49] [50] [51] [52] 67] . Our alignment data indicated that the C1q domain known to be involved in target binding and formation or stabilization of the hydrophobic core of the gC1q structure is relatively well conserved among CBLN11 orthologs [44, 54, 68] . This data suggests that this C1q domain might play important roles in CBLN11 activity. However, CBLN11 function may be divergent among the clupeocephala species given the differences of sequence (i.e. lack of signal peptide, heterogeneity of coiled coil region) observed among orthologs.",

GEO Profiles on NCBI databasis indicates that cbln11 mRNA expression has been observed by microarray experiments in the heart, retina and brain of zebrafish but without any information on relative abundances of the transcript among the tissues. In the present study, we found by qPCR analysis that cbln11 mRNA was mainly expressed in the olfactory rosette and in the gills of adult sea bass. Low expression was also observed in the skeletal muscle, heart and in the different parts of the central nervous system while no expression was detected in the liver, spleen, kidney or intestine. According to that, cbln11 mRNA was also shown to be not expressed in the liver of zebrafish [58] . In half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) and in black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii), sghC1q mRNA was shown to be widely expressed throughout all the tested tissues including immune related organs such as spleen and kidney with highest expression detected in the liver [51, 52] . The fact that cbln11 mRNA expression profile differs from that observed for sghC1q genes in half-smooth tongue sole and in black rockfish suggests that these genes are not orthologs to Cbln11 gene. While sghC1q mRNA expression was detected in the gills of these former species, the present study is, to our knowledge, one of the first to reveal the expression of a C1qDC protein in the peripheral olfactory organ. One previous study only mentioned the presence of an EST coding for a protein containing a C1Q and collagen domain in the olfactory epithelium transcriptome of the goldfish (Carassius auratus) [69] .",

                "text": "In European sea bass, the peripheral olfactory organ contains a rosette consisting of about forty lamellae covered by the olfactory epithelium [70] . The olfactory lamellae are gradually raised in the olfactory cavity during European sea bass larval development [70] . The exponential pattern of cbln11 mRNA expression observed during larval development in the present study may be associated to the development of olfactory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium, in European sea bass as in other fish species, includes sensory and non-sensory areas [71] . In European sea bass, the sensory epithelium consists mainly in bipolar neurons, ciliated non-sensory cells, rod cells and rodlet cells while the nonsensory epithelium is mainly made up of microridge cells, and also goblet cells and ciliated nonreceptor cells. The sensory epithelium is located in the flat surfaces of the lamellae while the nonsensory epithelium occupies the basal and the apical parts of the olfactory lamellae [70] . In the present study, cbln11 mRNA expression was shown to be expressed in non-neural cells lining the non-sensory epithelium at the basal and the apical parts of the olfactory lamellae, and more specifically in the microridge cells and possibly in goblet cells based on the uniform labelling distribution on the epithelial surface. This data indicates that CBLN11 protein contrary to C1q-like protein is not directly involved in the synapse organization of neuronal cells and in the olfactory sensory pathway. Considering the potential role played by cbln11 gene in the defense against pathogens we can hypothesize that CBLN11 protein may be secreted by the epithelial cells in the mucosal non-sensory epithelium of olfactory rosette to participate to the antipathogenic response. According to that, Sepahi and collaborators [72] localized immune cells in the non-sensory mucosal epithelium at the top of each olfactory lamella in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Additional histological analysis using marker of immune cells would be necessary to confirm a putative expression of cbln11 mRNA in cells involved in immune response. Moreover, it would be necessary to evaluate this cbln11 mRNA expression after bacterial or viral infection. The analysis of antibacterial and antiviral properties of CBLN11 will definitely reveal the implication of the protein in antipathogen responses. Similar investigation in the gills could also reveal comparable function of the cbln11gene in another epithelial tissue.",

                "text": "An important finding in the current study was the OA-induced effect on cbln11 mRNA levels in the whole larvae as well as in the olfactory rosette of European sea bass. Interestingly, our data revealed significant lower quantities of cbln11 mRNA levels in the whole F0 larvae 45 days after the beginning of the exposure to the OA. The early OA-induced significant decrease in cbln11 mRNA contrast with the OA-induced significant increase levels observed four years later at adult stage in the same population. Since our ISH analysis revealed that cbln11 mRNA labelling was restricted to olfactory rosette, we assume that the regulation observed at larval stage mainly occurred in this tissue. One hypothesis explaining the opposite effects of OA on cbln11 mRNA expression levels in F0 may be a differential susceptibility to OA between larval and adult stages. Indeed, previous data obtained in marine organisms indicate that susceptibility to OA may be variable among different life stages [73, 74] . However, this hypothesis may be rebutted since cbln11 mRNA was also shown to be significantly higher at both larval and juvenile stages in individuals from the F1 generation exposed to OA compared to control group. A second explanation for the lower levels of cbln11mRNA expression in F0 larvae exposed to OA could be a delay in the process of olfactory rosette development. Indeed, we showed in the present study that cbln11 mRNA levels gradually increased during normal larval development. Time-course histological analysis of olfactory rosette development combined with investigation of other genes expressed in this tissue (e.g. olfactory marker proteins) would allow to confirm this hypothesis. Finally, the third hypothesis explaining the different OA-induced effects on cbln11 mRNA levels between larval and adult stage in F0 generation may be related to the duration of exposure. Contrary to what has been shown for other environmental constraints such as hypoxia [75] , very few studies to our knowledge mention an effect of lifetime exposure to OA on the physiological response in fish species [38] . On the opposite, studies in fish indicate that the impact of OA on behavior persists regardless of the duration of exposure [11, 37] . However, it is now admitted that duration of exposure to environmental constraint may modify epigenetic state (i.e. modification of DNA and histones) of a genome which may interact with environmental and developmental factors to influence the gene expression [76, 77] . Thus, the within-life different cbln11 mRNA expression response to OA observed in the present study may result from the complex interaction among factors [Gene x (Environment + Epigenetic) x Development x Stochasticity] which underlie developmental phenotypic plasticity [78] . Kinetic investigation of epigenetic regulation on olfactory rosette genome during the exposure of European sea bass to OA would allow to confirm this hypothesis. Interestingly, the present study reveals that similar higher expression of cbln11 mRNA expression persisted in larvae from F1 exposed to OA compared to control group. This data thus suggests no transgenerational acclimation of cbln11 mRNA expression. This lack of transgenerational acclimation contrasts with data obtained in anemonefish Amphiprion melanopus in which effects of OA on the metabolic rate, growth and survival of juvenile were absent or reversed when their parents were reared under similar OA condition [40] .",

While the functional role of CBLN11 protein still needs to be determined, there is a strong case it is involved in immune responses within the nasal mucosa of European sea bass. The regulation of mRNA expression following OA could reflect the implication of cbln11 gene in the defense system involved in the protection against the danger that represents a lower pH [79] . Whether the upregulation of cbln11 mRNA expression under OA observed in the present study is associated with higher protein level and with modification of immune function and defense capacities against pathogen remains to be explored. To our knowledge, contrary to numerous studies performed in invertebrates [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] , only few studies in fish mentioned a plastic response of defense system to ocean acidification [32, 85] . This kind of evidence would provide valuable information on the impact of OA on fish fitness. ",

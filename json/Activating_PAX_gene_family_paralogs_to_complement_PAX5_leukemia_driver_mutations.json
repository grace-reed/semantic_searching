    "abstract": "PAX5, one of nine members of the mammalian paired box (PAX) family of transcription factors, plays an important role in B cell development. Approximately one-third of individuals with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) acquire heterozygous inactivating mutations of PAX5 in malignant cells, and heterozygous germline loss-of-function PAX5 mutations cause autosomal dominant predisposition to ALL. At least in mice, Pax5 is required for pre-B cell maturation, and leukemic remission occurs when Pax5 expression is restored in a Pax5-deficient mouse model of ALL. Together, these observations indicate that PAX5 deficiency reversibly drives leukemogenesis. PAX5 and its two most closely related paralogs, PAX2 and PAX8, which are not mutated in ALL, exhibit overlapping expression and function redundantly during embryonic development. However, PAX5 alone is expressed in lymphocytes, while PAX2 and PAX8 are predominantly specific to kidney and thyroid, respectively. We show that forced expression of PAX2 or PAX8 complements PAX5 loss-of-function mutation in ALL cells as determined by modulation of PAX5 target genes, restoration of immunophenotypic and morphological differentiation, and, ultimately, reduction of replicative potential. Activation of PAX5 paralogs, PAX2 or PAX8, ordinarily silenced in lymphocytes, may therefore represent a novel approach for treating PAX5-deficient ALL. In pursuit of this strategy, we took advantage of the fact that, in kidney, PAX2 is upregulated by extracellular hyperosmolarity. We found that hyperosmolarity, at potentially clinically achievable levels, transcriptionally activates endogenous PAX2 in ALL cells via a mechanism dependent on NFAT5, a transcription factor coordinating response to hyperosmolarity. We also found that hyperosmolarity upregulates residual wild type PAX5 expression in ALL cells and modulates gene expression, including in PAX5-mutant primary ALL cells. These findings specifically demonstrate that osmosensing pathways may represent a new therapeutic target for ALL and more broadly point toward the possibility of using gene paralogs to rescue mutations driving cancer and other diseases.",

                "text": "The transcription factor PAX5 plays a central role in the origin of pre-B ALL as the single most common somatically mutated gene observed in the disease [8] [9] [10] . About one-third of patients acquire heterozygous PAX5 mutations, with complete loss of both alleles rarely seen [9, 11] . Deletions or other loss-of-function mutations are typical, but, less frequently, PAX5 rearranges to form fusion genes with ETV6 or other partners, generating dominant negative proteins [12] . Heterozygous germline PAX5 loss-of-function mutation is also a cause of inherited predisposition to ALL [13, 14] . In ALL cases defined by wild type PAX5, some acquire mutations in EBF or E2A (TCF3) [9] , both of which are upstream activators of PAX5 [5] . Functionally, PAX5 activates B lymphoid-specific gene expression while repressing genes specifying alternative lineages, including T lymphocyte-promoting, NOTCH1 [15] . As such, B lymphoid development in the bone marrow of Pax5-null mice arrests at the pre-B stage [16] . Pax5 lossof-function in conjunction with Stat5 activation results in developmental blockage of the B cell transcriptional program and leukemic transformation in mice [17] . Importantly, forced reexpression of PAX5 in PAX5-deficient ALL was recently shown to normalize growth and differentiation of leukemic cells in culture and clear circulating leukemic cells in a Pax5-deficient/Stat5-activated mouse model of ALL [18, 19] . While cooperating mutations in additional genes arise during leukemogenesis [20] , these findings, taken together, indicate that reduced PAX5 activity reversibly drives the formation of pre-B ALL and represents an intriguing therapeutic target.",

Therefore, it is not hard to imagine that PAX2 and PAX8 could represent intact yet latent functional substitutes for PAX5 in pre-B ALL. Here we demonstrate the ability of both PAX2 and PAX8 to substitute for PAX5 loss-offunction and reverse the developmental blockade in pre-B ALL cells. We show that restoration of differentiation is similar using all three PAX family members and consists of changes to downstream gene expression, cell surface marker expression, cell size, and ultimately cell growth and survival. Additionally, as the translational utility of this strategy is predicated on the ability to activate the endogenous expression of these paralogs in the B cell lineage, we evaluate the aforementioned pathway of response to hyperosmolarity, which plays a prominent role in the kidney. We show that PAX2 and PAX5 exhibit transcriptional upregulation in response to hyperosmolarity in pre-B ALL cells, that PAX2 activation in lymphocytes, as in the kidney, is mediated by the tonicity response enhancer binding protein (TonEBP/NFAT5), and, finally, that hyperosmolarity-driven PAX2/5 activation correlates with changes in B cell developmental gene expression similar to those seen with exogenous PAX2/5/8 re-expression.",

We initially evaluated the ability of PAX5, PAX2 or PAX8 to regulate a subset of PAX5 transcriptional targets, including CD79a, BACH2, and CD19. We also included CD10, which is a marker of B cell differentiation exhibiting a bell-shaped pattern of developmental expression levels that peak at the pro to pre-B cell transition [18, 31] . We tested PAX factors in Reh cells, which were derived from a primary clonal culture isolated from pre-B ALL peripheral blood [32] and contain a heterozygous p. A322fs PAX5 null mutation [33] . As a PAX5 wild type control, we compared 697 cells, which are derived from a primary clonal culture of ALL bone marrow [34] and contain an E2A (TCF3)/PBX1 fusion gene arising from a t(1;19) chromosomal translocation [35] . Cells were stably transduced with lentivirus expressing either full length human PAX5, PAX2, or PAX8, along with a fluorescent marker, ZsGreen, driven from an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). As a functionally negative control, we used a vector expressing the clinically observed pre-B ALL PAX5 null mutation, PAX5 p.V26fs [36] . At day 4 following transduction, 2\u00d710 5 ZsGreenpositive cells of each transduction type were sorted by FACS (see S2 Fig for gating strategy) . Using quantitative real time PCR, we found that transgene expression of PAX5, PAX2, or PAX8 in both Reh and 697 cells led to significant upregulation of PAX5 target gene expression, relative to empty vector or the negative control PAX5 p.V26fs . With the exception of CD10, which is not a known PAX5 transcriptional target, this upregulation was more pronounced in PAX5-mutant Reh cells compared to PAX5-wild type 697 cells (Fig 2A and 2B , respectively).",

CD10 (CALLA) and CD19 are surface markers found on normal, as well as leukemic, pre-B cells. Increases in both markers are expect to accompany B cell differentiation, whereas CD38 and CD43 are both downregulated during the large-to-small pre-B cell transition [18, 37] . Reh and 697 pre-B ALL cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing PAX-IRES-ZsGreen, as before. At day 4 post-transduction, cells were stained with antibodies for cell surface markers, followed by analysis of ZsGreen-positive cells using flow cytometry. Cells expressing PAX5, PAX2, or PAX8 constructs showed significantly upregulated levels of CD10 and CD19 with downregulated levels of CD38 and CD43, relative to cells transduced with either empty vector or PAX5 p.V26fs (Fig 3A and 3B ). These results demonstrate a level of functional phenotypic rescue beyond simple transcriptional activation and show a shared ability within the PAX2/5/8 subfamily to promote immunophenotypic changes associated with advanced differentiation in pre-B ALL. Interestingly, PAX5-wild type 697 cells again exhibited similar results ( Fig 3C, note scale of intensity). ",

As noted, we observed that transduction of Reh and 697 cells with PAX paralogs led to decreases in expression of CD38 and CD43, which are both downregulated during this transition [18, 37] . This observation suggested that, consistent with prior observations related to PAX5 re-expression in Reh cells [18] , PAX2 and PAX8 could advance differentiation in these cells, driving them through the large-to-small transition and ultimately to a normal, more quiescent state. To address this possibility, we analyzed changes in cell size as well as effects on replicative potential following transduction with PAX factors.",

Cells were transduced with PAX5, PAX2, PAX8, empty vector, or PAX5 p.V26fs negative control. At day 4 post-transduction, 2\u00d710 5 cells of each group were FACS-sorted for ZsGreen (at~98% purity, see S2 Fig for gating strategy) and returned to culture. For the following 6 days, daily measurement of culture density, performed in duplicate using a hemocytometer, allowed us to compile growth curves for all groups. While control cultures expanded normally, PAX paralog expression resulted in a complete inhibition of culture expansion in Reh cells ( Fig 4C, S4A Fig) . Growth inhibition was also present, but less complete, in 697 cells ( Fig 4D, S4B Fig) and largely absent in HEK293T control cells (S3B Fig) . From this point, it became necessary to periodically passage cultures in order to maintain viable cell densities (i.e., 2\u00d710 5 -2\u00d710 6 cells/mL). At days 11-14, we again used flow cytometry to measure ZsGreen-expressing cell population. Cultures transduced with PAX paralogs exhibited dramatically reduced ZsGreen expression as a percentage of total cells, ranging from 28-54% in Reh cells and 6-13% in 697 cells, whereas both the empty vector and PAX5 p.V26fs control groups maintained expression in~90% of cells ( Fig 4E and S4C Fig) . Growth inhibition and the reduced proportion of ZsGreen-positive cells together suggest that these cells reduce their rate of growth and are outgrown by the~2% of ZsGreen negative cells initially harvested by mis-sorting and/or that PAX/ZsGreen-positive cells die out so that only ZsGreen-negative cells remain and continue to grow. In support of the latter interpretation, PAX gene expression led to an apparent delay in cell cycle progression and conferred a modest increase in apoptosis, as measured by flow cytometry analysis of DNA content (with DAPI staining) and Annexin V staining, respectively (S5 Fig) .",

We then evaluated compounds known to induce PAX family gene expression in other model systems. Manipulation of transmembrane voltage potential in Xenopus laevis activates transcription factors, including PAX6, resulting in ectopic eye formation [40] . Based on this observation, we tested a variety of hyper-and hypo-polarizing compounds for their ability to induce PAX2 and/or PAX8 expression in Reh cells. We found that 24 hour exposure to membrane depolarizing concentrations (80mM) of C 6 H 11 KO 7 (K-gluconate) in cell media led to induction of PAX2 expression to as much as 0.3 fold of baseline PAX5, as measured by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, significant upregulation of PAX5 expression was also observed ( While such concentrations of K-gluconate are known to induce membrane depolarization [41] , treatment with monensin and other compounds that are also known to promote membrane hypopolarization did not influence expression of PAX genes. As both potassium and gluconate ions are potentially capable of independent interaction with membrane channels or other cellular machinery that could influence downstream gene expression [42] , we tested a variety of salts containing these and other ions, for their ability to influence PAX expression. Surprisingly, 80mM concentrations of NaC H 11 O 7 (Na-gluconate), KCl, CaCl 2 , and NaCl all promoted detectable induction of both PAX2 at 0.08-0.5 fold and PAX5 at 3.8-6.1 fold, relative to baseline PAX5 ( Fig 5A) . Evaluation of downstream PAX5 target and developmental marker genes, CD19, BACH2, and CD10, demonstrated concurrent upregulation at levels similar to those seen with transgene-driven exogenous PAX expression ( Fig 5B) . While the ionic composition of these agents differs, a commonality is that they all increase the osmolarity of cell growth media.",

While CD10 followed a similar temporal pattern to PAX gene modulation, increases in direct PAX5 target genes CD19 and BACH2 were delayed and more persistent, supportive of their sequential response to PAX induction following hyperosmolarity, rather than to hyperosmolarity alone ( Fig 5G) . Interestingly, the RNA collection method affected the magnitude of induction for PAX2, which was as much as 10-fold greater in RNA extracted from cells immediately following treatment compared to RNA harvested from cells which were first treated, then sorted for viability (as assed by FSC-A/SSC-A).

Of note, gene sets related to the transport of calcium ions, chloride ions, potassium ions, and organic anions, as well as cytosolic calcium regulation, are positively enriched for all three treatments-an expected result for cells exposed to K-gluconate and CaCl 2 , but not for forced expression of PAX5. Again, the MYCMAX_01 and E2F1_Q4 gene sets are negatively enriched, linking increasing osmolarity with a pathway for reduced proliferation and a decrease in B cell size [44] , although leading edge analysis of the gene sets suggests different genes responsible for enrichment when compared to PAX2/5/8 (S3 Table) .

Restoration of Pax5 in this model triggers durable disease remission. The log 2 fold change values we observed for these 31 genes in PAX2/5/8 transfected and CaCl 2 or K-gluconate treated cells appear in Fig 6E, charted alongside corresponding original data from Liu et al. Although treatment windows for our samples were somewhat brief compared to duration of Pax5 induction in mice, we found similar increases in relative expression across this set of 31 genes, albeit at levels roughly half of what Liu et al. reported. These data demonstrate that PAX paralog expression or hyperosmolar treatment both similarly modulate an important subset of genes associated with disease remission when PAX5 expression is restored to normal levels in cell and mouse models of PAX5-deficient ALL.",

Notably, relative to RNA-seq, magnitudes of induction (if present) were almost always greater using qRT-PCR \u0394\u0394CT values. This is likely due to the TonEBP/NFAT5 modulates PAX2 but not PAX5 upregulation in response to hyperosmolarity, revealing the NFAT5 pathway as a target for activating endogenous PAX2 expression in pre-B ALL Cellular response to hypertonicity, as brought about by hyperosmolarity, is thought to be largely mediated by the tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein, TonEBP [45] . TonEBP, also called (and referred to here as) NFAT5 (nuclear factor of activated T cells 5), is a transcription factor predominantly associated with the kidney but which is also expressed in other tissues, including B cells and, as its name suggests, T cells. Initial response to hypertonicity by NFAT5 involves post-translational modification via phosphorylation, followed by transcriptional activity, including self-induction. Interestingly, NFAT5 mediated gene regulation in the high salt environment of nephrons has been shown to include elevated PAX2 expression, seemingly as part of a survival mechanism during osmotic stress [30] . Not surprisingly, our RNA-seq data showed that hyperosmolarity in Reh cells led to induction of NFAT5, as well as several of its downstream targets (S1 Dataset), consistent with the notion that hyperosmolar concentrations of K-gluconate and CaCl 2 generate a canonical response to hypertonicity (i.e., an increase in osmotic pressure gradient across the cell membrane). Subsequent evaluation by qRT-PCR confirmed that NFAT5 mRNA levels, as well as a downstream target associated with B cell maturation, B cell activating factor (BAFF), along with its receptor, TNFRSF13C (BAFF-R) [46] , were upregulated in Reh cells after 24 hour treatment with 80mM K-gluconate or CaCl 2 (Fig 8A) .

To determine whether NFAT5 was involved in hyperosmolarity-induced expression of PAX2 and PAX5 and to concurrently assess whether such PAX upregulation directly affected downstream gene modulation, we performed siRNA knockdown of these three genes (Fig 8B and 8C) . We found that siRNA knockdown of NFAT5 was sufficient to abrogate PAX2 upregulation in response to 80mM K-gluconate in Reh cells (Fig 8C) . Similarly, knockdown of NFAT5 quenched hyperosmolarity mediated increases in the solute carriers, SLC5A3 and SLC6A6, both of which are known targets of NFAT5 (S8B Fig) [48] . Interestingly, neither PAX5 nor PAX5 downstream genes upregulated in response to hyperosmolarity were affected by NFAT5 knockdown (Fig 8C) , consistent with a separate, NFAT5 independent mechanism for induction of PAX5 or, at least, reduced sensitivity of PAX5 to changes in NFAT5 levels. Importantly, knockdown of PAX5 itself led to reductions in expression of the downstream genes we assessed, while siRNA directed against PAX2 had little effect (Fig 8C) , suggesting that hypertonic induction of residual wild type PAX5 expression outweighs PAX2 with respect to regulation of their common targets. We note that PAX2 expression is detectable as a transcript, but insufficient to measure at the protein level by western blot.",

However, western blot indicates that, in addition to a full-length PAX5 protein corresponding to the wild type allele, a truncated polypeptide that is likely non-functional is apparently generated from the mutant allele, albeit at reduced abundance, suggesting that nonsense-mediated decay is incomplete (as evident in Fig 8B, where both products are specifically targeted by siRNA directed against PAX5). Reh cells should therefore contain mRNA from both the wild type and mutant PAX5 alleles. To determine if either salt treatment differentially activates the wild type as opposed to the mutant PAX5 allele in Reh cells, we analyzed RNA-seq data and compared the total number of reads obtained from each allele (and that also include the distinguishing mutation). In untreated cells, 27 of 105 total, non-normalized reads (26%) corresponded to transcripts from the mutant allele. In K-gluconate or CaCl 2 treated cells, the equivalent proportions of mutant transcripts were 54/261 (21%) and 36/135 (27%), respectively. (Using a two-tailed test to compare two population proportions, for untreated versus K-gluconate treated cells, the Z-score is 1.05 and p-value is 0.29. The same comparison for CaCl 2 treated cells yields a Z-score of -0.17 and pvalue of 0.87). These differences are not significant. We conclude that neither salt treatment discriminates between wild type and mutant allele when activating PAX5 expression, as reflected in proportionately increased total read counts. ",

To further evaluate whether the PAX2/5 response to hyperosmolarity is one that is intrinsic to ALL cells both in vitro and in vivo, we screened 10 primary pre-B ALL samples for PAX5 mutations, using Sanger DNA sequencing. Of those samples, one, from a 19 year-old male with trisomy 21 Down syndrome, possessed a heterozygous p.(K198Qfs \u00c3 44) mutation, resulting in frameshift leading to early stop and protein truncation (see Methods). Pre-B ALL occurs more commonly in Down syndrome individuals and is felt to be biologically distinct from disease occurring in non-Down syndrome patients [51] ; nevertheless, inactivating mutations of PAX5 are detected at similar frequency in Down syndrome-associated pre-B ALL [52] . Due to limited sample availability from this patient, we performed a single test employing primary cells alongside multiple replicates using primary cells expanded through passage in mice (see Methods). Whether direct from the patient or passaged through mice, 24 hour exposure to 80mM K-gluconate resulted in increased expression of PAX5, as well as several but not all downstream targets seen previously with Reh and 697 cells ( Fig 9A and S10A Fig) . PAX2 expression was not detected in this assay; however, this may be due in part to low RNA input levels, which were constrained by sample quantity.",

However, mannitol is also known to activate NFAT5 [53] and is used to adjust serum hyperosmolar concentrations to high levels in certain clinical settings [54] . To test whether mannitol could be employed to upregulate PAX2 or PAX5 in pre-B ALL, we treated Reh cells with 80mM or 160mM mannitol for 24 hours, prior to FACS sorting for live cells and harvesting of RNA. qRT-PCR demonstrated dose-dependent increases both for PAX2 and especially for PAX5, along with similar changes in downstream gene expression, albeit not to the level seen with K-gluconate ( Fig 9B and 9C) . Importantly, 160mM is near the range of clinically achievable therapeutic concentrations for mannitol [54] . Comparison of 160mM mannitol with 80mM K-gluconate or CaCl 2 , followed by FSC-A/SSC-A sorting of live cells and subsequent measurement of culture expansion demonstrated slightly reduced growth potential for K-gluconate and CaCl 2 treated cells as compared to cells grown in 160mM mannitol or normal media (S10B Fig) . Interpretation of long term viability in response to hyperosmolarity was complicated due to the noticeably brief induction of PAX2/5 (Fig 5E) , coupled with the generally harsh nature of such treatment, even with only 24 hour exposure. The growth delay observed with K-gluconate in this case may largely be due to cell cycle arrest or other adverse effects of elevated hyperosmolarity [55] , rather than the PAX dependent, developmentally programed exit from the cell cycle we appeared to observe with continuous PAX re-expression. However, even in vitro, mannitol appears to be better tolerated, and thus it or related organic osmolytes may present options for modulating tonicity that could prove tolerable in vivo.",

Regardless, targeting PAX2/5/8 activity may prove beneficial even in those patients lacking PAX5 mutations. Liu et al. also demonstrated that PAX5 replenishment succeeded in curing a transgenic mouse model of ALL, driven by PAX5 knockdown combined with Stat5 activation [18] . The fact that PAX5 re-expression normalizes growth and differentiation in pre-B ALL with divergent genetic backgrounds and mutational signatures, including with Down syndrome associated ALL as tested in primary cells, suggests that even after cooperating mutations have arisen, loss of PAX5 activity continues to support the leukemic state.

Chemotherapy is often successful in pediatric settings [1] but is associated with considerable toxicity, long-term side effects [2] , and substantially reduced efficacy in older children and adults, where allogenic stem cell transplant is more heavily relied upon [3] . Recent breakthroughs in CAR T cell therapy have shown great promise in treating certain disease presentations, specifically those which are highly CD19 positive [57] . However, hurdles remain, including clonal selection for PAX5 deletion with consequent downregulation of the CD19 target antigen, leading to disease resistance [58] . Since CD19 is a direct target of PAX5 and, as we have shown, can be activated equally well by PAX2 or PAX8, the therapeutic approach contemplated here may work in conjunction with CAR T cell therapy by increasing levels of the targeted CD19 B cell antigen, even after loss of PAX5. CD19 can also be targeted through other forms of therapy, such as with antibody-drug conjugates [59] .",

In a pairwise comparison of any of the three PAX factors, slightly fewer than half of all gene sets exhibiting significant expression changes were common to both, and only 13% of all gene sets (57/440, Fig 6A) enriched by PAX5 were commonly modulated by all three PAX genes. Importantly, however, the group of gene sets commonly regulated by all three PAX factors includes PAX5 targets most relevant to B cell maturation (Fig 6D) , consistent with our findings that all three PAX factors similarly promote differentiation of PAX5-deficient ALL cells. We speculate that PAX5 target genes likely reside in accessible chromatin configurations in pre-B cells, such that even imperfect PAX activity from a paralog may readily induce their expression. In contrast, gene sets exhibiting significant enrichment following treatment with CaCl 2 or Kgluconate exhibited much greater overlap with PAX5, and a majority of gene sets showing enrichment with PAX5 (221/420, Fig 6B) or that were commonly enriched by all three PAX factors (43/57, Fig 6C) were also enriched after treatment with CaCl 2 or K-gluconate. This may not be surprising given that treatment with either salt induced expression of PAX2 and, especially, PAX5 itself. Finally, it is worth emphasizing from a translationally relevant standpoint, that a set of 31 genes found by Liu et al. to undergo significant regulation during ALL remission, as induced by Pax5 restoration in a mouse model of Pax5-deficient ALL, were similarly modulated by all tested conditions in our studies, whether it be PAX5, PAX2, PAX8, Kgluconate, or CaCl 2 ( Fig 6C) .",

Named \"nuclear factor of activated T cells 5,\" for its role as a transcriptional coordinator of T cell immune response [60] , NFAT5 is the only known osmosensing mammalian transcription factor and is active in a variety of cell types, including B cells [45, 46] . Indeed, siRNA mediated knockdown of NFAT5 in Reh cells led to a reduction in PAX2 expression in response to hyperosmolarity ( Fig 8B and 8C) . However, the added observation that PAX5 expression was not affected by NFAT5 knockdown suggests either the presence of a separate, non NFAT5 related, osmosensing pathway upstream of PAX5, or alternatively, a substantially lower threshold for NFAT5 abundance to achieve upregulation of PAX5 under these conditions. In support of the latter, PAX5 appears to contain more potential NFAT5 binding sites than PAX2 (S9 Fig) . Separately, these siRNA experiments showed that PAX5 upregulation had a greater effect on downstream gene regulation, and presumably B cell maturation, than did PAX2 (Fig 8B and 8C) . Based on our observations from earlier experiments (Figs 2-4) , where PAX2 effectively functionally mimicked PAX5, and the substantially lower level of PAX2 expression present relative to the induced levels of PAX5 in response to hyperosmolarity (~20 fold), we believe this most likely reflects relative levels of expression, rather than differences in functionality.",

                "text": "Given that components of the hypertonicity response pathway are highly conserved from single cell organisms to mammals [61] , it seems reasonable to speculate that PAX genes, including PAX2 and PAX5, may play a role in osmotic adaptation across various tissue types. In fact, similar to our observations, upregulation of PAX2 occurs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in response to hypertonicity [48] . Secondary lymphoid organs, including spleen and thymus, maintains a remarkably high osmolar environment compared to serum and other tissue [62] . It should not be overlooked that a decrease in cell size, which we observed upon expression of PAX2/5/8, normally accompanies the large-to-small pre-B cell transition as cells begin their migration from the bone marrow to secondary lymphoid organs. It is possible that exposure to differences in local osmolarity across these compartments could play a role in normal lymphocyte development. Whether upregulation of PAX2 and/or PAX5 is a normal physiologic response to osmotic stress in lymphocytes or a vestigial pathway more heavily relied on in other tissues such as the kidney, but which is capable of artefactual activation under extreme circumstances, we show here that osmotic stress exposes a potential therapeutic target for activating elements of the normal B cell differentiation program. The osmolar concentration required for peak induction of PAX2 and PAX5 is, just barely, outside the clinically achievable range for serum based on maximum recommended dosing for mannitol [54] . It is possible that specialized delivery methods, manipulation of dosage levels, and/or exposure time may bridge this gap. It is also worth noting that serum osmolar concentrations within this range are sometimes encountered in acutely ill diabetes mellitus patients with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome [63] . However, even if the highly hyperosmolar conditions we subjected ALL cells to in vitro are not therapeutically tenable in vivo, they do suggest that the complexity of kinases and other components of the signaling pathway responding to hypertonicity, including those regulating NFAT5, at least in the case of PAX2 [64] , may be ripe for investigation as drug targets.",

Intriguingly, a relevant recent in vitro study demonstrated that hyperosmotic stress achieved with salt or mannitol treatment synergized with chemotherapeutic drugs to kill ALL cells via an NFAT5 dependent mechanism, although activation of PAX genes was not investigated [53] . It should also be emphasized that remissions achieved with differentiation therapy employing ATRA for promyelocytic leukemia can actually be enduring [7] . Finally, if differentiation of pre-B ALL cells could be pushed as far as to the plasma cell stage, where PAX5 expression is normally extinguished [65] , then mutations inactivating PAX5 could become inconsequential, anyway.",

PAX2, when activated, can behave as an oncogene in solid tumors [66] , and PAX5 is normally down-regulated during plasma cell differentiation [65] . However, our RNA-seq data suggest that there may be an auto-regulatory ceiling for PAX gene expression, particularly for PAX5. Specifically, by examining total PAX5 transcripts and comparing differences in the read ratios of SNPs discriminating between native and exogenous PAX5, we observed an apparent suppression of endogenous PAX5 transcript by PAX5 transgene expression, and to a lesser extent, by the expression of PAX2 or PAX8 transgenes (S12 Fig) . Of course, unless PAX gene activation is confined only to the leukemic population of cells, there may be undesirable effects in other tissues, although compared to oncogenic mutations, PAX gene activation by osmoresponsive mechanisms is unlikely to be permanent. Moreover, some current cancer therapies employ treatment with epigenetic modifier drugs, such as azacitidine, capable of producing genome-wide and persistent activation of many genes across multiple tissues [67] .",

More generally, a wide variety of non-cancer illnesses possess etiologies for which complementation of inactivating mutations by activating gene paralogs may prove useful, extending the potential therapeutic application of this concept. For example, in spinal muscular atrophy, causative loss-of-function mutations in SMN1 can be rescued by a recently approved therapy which uses an antisense compound to promote exon retention in an alternatively spliced yet otherwise identical paralog, SMN2 [69] . Finally, hypertonic activation of PAX gene expression offers an example of emerging \"electroceutical\" approaches based on manipulation of biophysical phenomena [41] .",

Based on hybrid capture exome sequencing, 697 cells are reported in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) [71] as being heterozygous for the PAX5 null mutation p.R225fs; however, we could not confirm this mutation upon Sanger DNA sequencing (S13 Fig) , and review of the CCLE primary data shows that both read depth and variant allele count at this position are minimal, consistent with artifact. To verify the identity of the 697 cell line in our possession, we performed Sanger DNA sequencing and confirmed the existence of two separate and uncommon CCLE-reported gene mutations, intrinsic to this cell line; heterozygous NRAS p.G12D and hemizygous GPR112 p.D2657del (S13 Fig) . While not identified in the CCLE, Reh cells have been previously reported to contain a heterozygous p.A322fs mutation [33] , which we confirmed by Sanger sequencing (S13 Fig) . For further verification of cell line identity, low passage samples of both Reh and 697 cells were submitted to ATCC for short tandem repeat profiling and validation by comparison with known profiles for Reh and 697 cell lines. The samples were profiled using the PowerPlex 18D system (Promega), which provides a signature encompassing 17 short tandem repeat loci plus Amelogenin (S14 and S15 Figs).",

However, an explanation is lacking as to how the necessary accommodations in response to these challenges are organized and coordinated from (sub)cellular to higher-level physiological functions, especially in mammals. We propose that the chemistry that enables coordination and synchronization of these processes dates to the origins of Life. We offer a conceptual framework based upon the nature of electron exchange (Redox) processes that co-evolved with biological complexification, giving rise to a multi-layered system in which intra/intercellular and inter-organ exchange processes essential to sensing and adaptation stay fully synchronized. Our analysis explains why Redox is both the lingua franca and the mechanism that enable integration by connecting the various elements of regulatory processes. We here define these interactions across levels of organization as the 'Redox Interactome'. This framework provides novel insight into the chemical and biological basis of Redox signalling and may explain the recent convergence of metabolism, bioenergetics, and inflammation as well as the relationship between Redox stress and human disease.",

                "text": "Physiology is the study of how cells, tissues and organs function within a living system. It embraces the responses to challenges within which the chemical, physical and metabolic processes that enable ongoing functions are modulated. The capability of the body to modify its behavior at every level of organization thereby maintains stability and confers robustness. A cell or organ-based investigative approach enables understanding at those levels, but integration of these individual components within the whole body requires a broader systems-based understanding along the lines adopted by Systems Biology. Systems Biology is a relatively young discipline whose principles are based on the foundation of Ludwig von Bertalanffy's 'General Systems Theory' [1, 2] . Bertalanffy strongly objected to reductionism and argued that all systems, whether organic or organizational, are influenced by interaction with their environment and exhibit common characteristics that follow the same underlying principles.",

Expanding our understanding and the capability of generating a considerable body of information through the 'omics revolution' will provide further detailed knowledge of the many complex interactions [3] . The ordering, structuring, and interpretation of 'big data' constitute a substantial, time-consuming task. But even with the information ordered and integrated there remains a major challenge in getting to grips with an adequate understanding of the distinction between inanimate and living matter, between chemistry and biochemistry [4 ,5,6 ] , that limits insight into aspects of fundamental regulatory mechanisms. Much recent emphasis has been placed on considerations around the origin-of-life chemistry and related systems chemistry. Yet, there has been an almost exclusive focus on replication and reproductive aspects with rather less attention being given to those elements or pathways that are essential to survival between episodes of replication; notwithstanding that where there is no survival, there is no replication.",

One fundamental challenge that remains for Systems Physiology is to identify the organizing principles that enable living systems [11] , and which adequately embrace an appreciation of the nature of 'robustness' and 'emergence' in Systems Biology, thereby providing meaning to the sense that 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts'. There is lack of clarity of meaning for two other terms used in the more recent physiology literature: 'resilience' and 'convergence'. Resilience captures the complex construct that characterizes the ability of an organism, or organization, to withstand and recover from a stressful challenge. The term has been used in contexts as divergent as business, computing, ecology, military combat readiness, and material sciences as well as mental health, physical fitness, and wellness of individuals and populations. An overarching theme in human resilience is the ability to accommodate unforeseen environmental challenge of varying degrees with the potential to recover with return of usual function. This applies in areas as diverse as psychosocial stress, exposure to toxic or biological threat or wider changes in the metabolic needs of the organism. Convergence is more straightforward, and there is a growing interest in exploring the relationships between intermediary metabolism, cellular bioenergetics, oxidative stress/Redox signalling, circadian clocks, and inflammation in areas as diverse as immunology, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular function, and cancer [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , with similar developments happening in plant and bacterial research. What triggered this development is unknown. While common underlying principles are often expressed differently from one context to another, there is agreement that many cellular events are closely linked to Redox processes. Thus, these recent insights (and uncertainties) may be considered to be a direct consequence of an increased interest in the concepts around 'oxidative stress'.",

                "text": "For over three decades, an understanding of ill health has been associated with the oxidative stress concept in the form of 'an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the oxidants', which developed into the idea of a 'disrupted Redox signalling' [22] . The refinement of this concept has been hastened by the articulation of a 'Redox Code' in an influential paper describing a set of principles through which biological function is enabled and protected [23 ] . Many disease processes are attributed to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or 'dysfunctional Redox regulation'. Yet, not everything can be explained by excessive ROS production. Many pathophysiological conditions may in fact exemplify processes that can be accounted for by other bioactive entities such as reactive nitrogen or sulfur species (RNS, RSS), or other small signalling molecules such as H 2 , NH 3 , and CO. Many of these entities can react with each other, with protein thiols or other biomolecules. These varied interactions modulate the function of ion channels, enzymes, transcription factors, and other biological targets, a scenario we defined as the 'Reactive Species Interactome ' [24 ] . This Reactive Species Interactome concept provides a useful framework to help explain the apparent complexity of adaptive signalling. There is no single marker or process that captures the complexity of these interactions adequately. Rather, it is likely that a combination of readouts from different levels of organization will be required to explain how and why mitochondrial function appears so intimately related to chronic disease, inflammation and metabolism. Being able to distinguish 'wellbeing' from 'feeling ill' likely will require integrative approaches such as multi-level systems analysis [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

We approached this from a consideration that provides a rational perspective on Redox-mediated or modulated events and offers a perspective that can be modelled and integrated with ongoing analytical methods and approaches. To clarify how these physiological functions have developed and are related it is necessary to reflect on the evolutionary journey required for coping with environmental challenge since the beginnings of Life. This reflection indicates that the Redox architecture of physiological function that we see today has its origin in the processes that enabled all forms of life to emerge and cope with the exigencies of day-to-day life in changing, and sometimes hostile, environmental conditions. This is captured as the underlying principle for the generic response for survival. We have chosen examples from the nitric oxide (NO) field of research to illustrate the concept, not only because it is a ubiquitous signalling molecule whose production and metabolism is dependent on cellular Redox status, but also because it acts as a chain-breaking antioxidant [32] and even its prototypical receptor (soluble guanylate cyclase) appears to be under Redox control [33] . We sought to avoid any particular oxygen/ROS-centric perspective, which can limit consideration of other relationships of similar or even greater importance, in order to place emphasis and greater clarity on the more general term 'Redox stress'.",

By definition all biomolecules can engage in 'Redox' (i.e. electron transfer) processes because their atomic constituents can either act as electron donors (reductants) or acceptors (oxidants). The Redox activity will depend on the chemical properties of the set of molecules with which they interact, that is, their Redox environment [34] . The potential effective environment is extensive (Scheme 1). The simplest Redox molecules consist of small gases such as H 2 , H 2 S, NO, O 2 , CO 2 and others as well as metal ions such as iron, copper, molybdenum and tungsten [35, 36] . Most reviews dealing with oxidative stress/Redox biology place emphasis on ROS (including superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) and thiol compounds (such as glutathione or thioredoxin). However, these constitute only a small proportion of the potential Redox population that includes many S (and Se), N or C-based Redox active compounds. Although focused scientific enquiry has tended to place emphasis on select compartments, in nature all Redox molecules may cross-react, forming a single synchronized network of electron-exchanging entities.",

The structure of Redox proteins has been modulated during the course of evolution giving rise to a large array of distinct isoforms that emerged alongside environmental changes, for example, cytochrome P 450 , NOS, SOD, and others [50, 51] . It is, therefore, not possible to assign a specific Redox chemistry to any particular family of proteins. The versatility of Redox chemistry is related to structural modifications, environmental changes and their combination. To illustrate, the catalytic site of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is a hub for a multitude of Redox chemistries [52] . As an oxidase, it achieves a double oxidation of a single substrate (L-arginine) into NO and citrulline [53] . However, it can also produce superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite under particular conditions [54] . The very same heme-thiolate moiety also entertains alternative chemistries such as the reduction of nitrite, homolytic cleavage of O-O bonds, dioxygenation of NO, peroxidation of nitrite, among other chemistries [55] .

Yet, this notion ignores the fundamentals of Redox biochemistry. These terms refer to relatively static relationships within a system that aims to keep cellular and organelle Redox potentials (often mistaken to reflect ROS concentrations or GSH/GSSG ratio) within a certain range by eliminating excess reductants or oxidants in order to achieve and/or maintain a better balance. This fails to account for the fact that Redox reactions imply differences in Redox potential (and not quantity) among a multiplicity of reactants some of which have the tendency to diffuse away or be transported elsewhere.

This symbiotic tuning is related to signaling processes mediated by nitrosylation or nitrosation-mediated processes. However, under oxidative conditions, NO is rapidly converted into other (sometimes more toxic) RNSs. As the concentrations of oxygen in the oceans rise (creating a more oxidative environment), all forms of NO gradually produce 'nitrosative stress' which is cytotoxic for marine life. What was first used as a symbiotic signal will eventually become an 'Eviction Notice' [75, 76] . In the wake of this new Redox landscape, non-specific immune reactions emerged as new types of Redox activity. Similar processes are likely at play in mammalian cells and tissues under inflammatory conditions (known to be associated with oxidative stress) affecting innate immunity.

'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' paradigm was proposed for NO and related RNS. Here, a specific Redox activity (nitrosylation) might be utilized for signaling functions, while other more reactive species such as peroxynitrite (ONOO \u00c0 ) might be associated with cytotoxic activities [67] . To ensure selectivity, possible side-reactions must be minimized. This could best be achieved by relying on short-distance, rapid reactions where possible. The concept of kinetic specificity [37] , might offer an explanation for the varied although highly selective reactions of RNSs and RSSs.

The question as to whether certain Redox changes are beneficial or deleterious depends on the level of organization, from cell to ecosystem. Physical exercise can be considered an example of a physiological stressor associated with enhanced oxidant production that is beneficial for human health by stimulating downstream Nrf2-related antioxidant defense systems [95] .",

Exposed to acute Redox stress, cells respond by adjusting metabolism to preserve structural and functional integrity, a process resulting in a modification of the Redox landscape (enhanced production of glutathione and heme, protecting free thiols, diminishing ROS impact, etc.). The outcome (survival, apoptosis, cell death) will depend on the available bioenergetic situation and adequacy of precursor supply to support the metabolic changes. During short-lasting high-intensity exercise (e.g. an athlete running a 400 m race) when the muscle is generating maximal forces, there is an instantaneous increase in ATP utilization that places an extreme local demand on cellular bioenergetics with resultant changes in Redox state to maintain ATP resynthesis. Cell death can only be avoided by ensuring that the metabolic consequences of hypoxia and acidosis within the motor unit that generates force is accommodated through concomitant changes in Redox state within the non-recruited motor units of the same muscle as well as across other tissues (e.g. liver and lung) and body fluids (buffering through changes in base excess).",

By comparison, facing a more global, longer-lasting stress, an organism will survive by utilizing 'long-range signaling' ('systemic acquired resistance' in plants) by modifying its functioning and adjusting its metabolic parameters to sustain transient but extensive Redox adjustment. An example for this situation is the inescapable hypobaric hypoxia experienced by those who sojourn to high altitude. Environmental hypoxia is associated with enhanced oxidative stress with compensatorily increased production of NO and adjustment in the handling of many other metabolites [96, 97] . By contrast, a population existing at altitude has to acquire Redox processes and chronic functional change that enable ongoing function without potential jeopardy to daily life, work or reproductive success. In this situation, genetic and epigenetic variability will facilitate the emergence of ways to improve survival and reproductive success in the different environment. Tibetan highlanders are an example of a population living at high-altitude who have evolved adaptations to the challenges of life in chronic hypoxia. Their whole-body production of NO is upregulated [98, 99] , and also adjustments have taken place at numerous other levels (including genetic and metabolic) within a surprisingly short period of time (10-20 millenia) indicative of the strong Darwinian selection pressure experienced [97] [98] [99] [100] .",

This concept fails to take adequate account of the potential richness of Redox physiology. Such Manichean vision is also at odds with the progressively acquired capabilities that characterize evolutionary development [4 ,9 ] . The Redox landscape is a continuum of Redox reactions that are tightly connected to a physico-chemical environment in permanent evolution. Dynamic Redox changes opened a new and wide register of possible interactions that act as the basis for dealing with variability and driving evolution.

Good health can be secured only when the physiological and metabolic demands of cells, tissues and organs are continually met with an adequate reserve to buffer periods of uncertainty. This inevitably requires sufficient metabolic plasticity to accommodate unusual stresses or changes in supply. Failing to meet those demands will result in accommodations in structure and function to maintain life at the cost of diminished reserves and greater vulnerability. Modest deficits in the short-term may be accommodated by altering metabolic priorities across the whole system, albeit with accumulating deficits over time. With ongoing challenge, the adaptations required to sustain Life will ultimately be overwhelmed. The consequence will be a resultant loss of metabolic control and an inability to maintain the constancy of the internal environment.

The sensing and adaptive signalling systems operating amongst cells and tissues have to interact collectively in order to maintain the internal milieu of the system as a whole. Although the diet may ultimately provide sufficient energy and a pattern of nutrients to support the system as a whole, there is the need to consider how the specific requirements of individual cells and tissues are met within a dynamic system of exchange and interchange. The demands for specific nutrients to maintain usual structure and function together with the capability to respond effectively to external stressors has to accommodate potentially competing demands in different compartments over time. This consideration refocuses attention on those nutrients that are known to serve as cofactors and essential determinants of mitochondrial metabolic function: such as the B vitamins (especially thiamine, riboflavin and pyridoxine) or choline (for lipid synthesis), together with metals such as iron, zinc and copper and appropriate sources for sulfur and nitrogen-based compounds. At this level, the importance of recently recognized metastable species such as polysulfides (compounds comprising chains of sulfur) have to be considered [102, 103 ] . Their particular roles in mitochondrial function/cellular energetics and whole-body Redox regulation require elucidation. Mitochondrial dysfunction with altered cellular Redox status is a common feature across many medical conditions. Targeted provision of nutrients, exemplified by 'feeding the mitochondria' [104, 105] , may mitigate adverse change and lead to improvements in structure and function. Further, the availability of conditionally essential nutrients (such as the amino acids glutamine, serine and glycine) together with folate (as a methyl carrier) and their interactions with methionine metabolism critically determine the maintenance of intracellular and systemic glutathione, especially in the stressed state. Such considerations have to be embraced within a more holistic approach to nutrition and Redox biology in which the Redox interactome represents the responsive interface between the individual and its environment [106 ] . Clearly, delivering 'precision nutrition' is not without challenges [107] .",

How this is achieved remains poorly understood. One approach to improving our understanding of the Redox landscape may be to adopt a dashboard 'omic-style approach using concurrent measurements of multiple aspects of Redox state at different levels of the system in a dynamic fashion (e.g. at rest and during exercise, fasting versus fed, normoxia versus hypoxia, etc.). This approach requires moving beyond measures that capture a static perspective of the system to the determination of kinetic measures of flux through a limited number of key nutrient-sensitive metabolic pathways (e.g. ascorbate and GSH production, arginine with its metabolites and determinants of one-carbon metabolism). The measurement of the availability of key micronutrients in functional pools and the analysis of the data using a multi-level holistic systems biology approach will be necessary to adequately model Redox state at the level of the cell, tissue, organ and whole body.

    "abstract": "It has been hypothesised that some specialised cognitive abilities may have evolved because of the challenges of living in complex social environments. Therefore, more-social species might be able to learn faster than less-social species. The aim of this study was to develop a learning framework to test how more-and less-social Lamprologine cichlid fishes perform across associative learning tasks. These cichlids are a group of closely related species with similar ecologies and life histories but varying degrees of sociality, making them an ideal group for comparative learning studies. We found that three nongrouping cichlids (Telmatochromis temporalis, Lamprologus meleagris, and Neolamprologus tretocephalus) outperformed three closely related highly social, cooperatively breeding cichlids (N. pulcher, N. multifasciatus, and Julidochromis dickfeldi) on an associative learning task based on food rewards. However, we hypothesised that these differences may be caused by the social environment during testing and might not reflect true cognitive differences. Indeed, when we drilled down and compared just two species across four different social conditions, we found that the social environment during learning trials affected the performance of the highly social N. pulcher and the less-social T. temporalis differently. We then performed further experiments with both N. pulcher and T. temporalis under more natural social settings. Under these more natural social conditions, we found that N. pulcher learned to differentiate accessible and inaccessible shelters faster than T. temporalis. These findings highlight the potential for expanding comparative experiments investigating the relationship between sociality and cognition and emphasise the crucial role social environment plays in learning outcomes. Public Significance Statement We found that differences in learning speed between more-and less-social fish are dependent on social conditions during testing. Additionally, although less-social fish were faster to learn a novel foraging task compared to more-social fish, the more-social Neolamprologus pulcher learned to distinguish accessible and inaccessible shelters faster than the less-social Telmatochromis temporalis when in natural social settings. We suggest that social conditions during testing are a critical factor in comparing species' learning abilities.",

                "text": "The ability to learn effectively is crucial for many species' survival. By accumulating knowledge through personal experience, individuals can better exploit their environment by employ-ing new skills and altering their behaviour in ways that potentially increase survival. For example, individuals can learn to forage more efficiently and better avoid predators (Brown & Laland, 2003; Griffin, Blumstein, & Evans, 2000) . Indeed, there are several examples of basic survival skills that do not appear to be innate but instead must be learned. The mortality rate of hatchery-reared fish released into the wild is much greater than for wild fish (Brown & Laland, 2001; Rodewald, Hyv\u00e4rinen, & Hirvonen, 2011) , and similarly, translocated or reintroduced animals are often more likely to be predated (Griffin et al., 2000; Shier & Owings, 2007) . In both instances, mortality can be reduced by training individuals to respond more appropriately to anticipated challenges.",

                "text": "However, not all species are equally capable of learning, with the most sophisticated learning abilities documented in primates (particularly apes, capuchins, and some Old World monkeys), several bird groups (such as parrots and crows), and toothed cetaceans (MacLean et al., 2014; Marino et al., 2007; Roth & Dicke, 2005; van Horik, Clayton, & Emery, 2012) . That these groups are also generally considered to be highly socially complex has led to several hypotheses linking sociality to cognitive ability (Clutton-Brock & Harvey, 1980; Dunbar, 1998; Dunbar & Shultz, 2007; Fox, Muthukrishna, & Shultz, 2017; Jerison, 1963; Whiten & Byrne, 1988) . In particular, the social brain hypothesis posits that greater cognitive ability has evolved in species with greater sociality because sociality is inherently cognitively challenging (Dunbar, 1998) . For example, social individuals may need to resolve conflicts with, coordinate movements with, and even simply recognise group members, whereas solitary individuals do not (Dunbar & Shultz, 2007) . Hence, it is possible that some aspects of cognitive ability are coupled with sociality. Although most species can learn about their environment, more-social species should be better able to learn than less-social species (Klopfer, 1959; Leadbeater, 2015; van Schaik & Burkart, 2011) . This may be particularly true for explicitly social tasks. Evidence for the social brain hypothesis mostly comes from studies that have correlated brain size, especially neocortex size, with the degree of sociality (Dunbar, 1992; Finlay & Darlington, 1995; Joffe & Dunbar, 1997; Paw\u0142owski, Lowen, & Dunbar, 1998) . In turn, several studies have correlated brain size and problem-solving ability (Benson-Amram, Dantzer, Stricker, Swanson, & Holekamp, 2016; Deaner, Isler, Burkart, & van Schaik, 2007; Lodato & Arlotta, 2015; Lui, Hansen, & Kriegstein, 2011; MacLean et al., 2014; Sakai, Arsznov, Hristova, Yoon, & Lundrigan, 2016; Shultz & Dunbar, 2010) .",

Muthukrishna and Henrich (2016) suggested that social living allows for the emergence of a \"collective brain\" whereby the social network acts as an information transfer network, allowing groups to pool their cognitive resources. Essentially, more-social species may learn better than less-social species simply because their social structure presents them with more opportunities to exploit easily accessible information (Muthukrishna & Henrich, 2016) . For example, a solitary individual attempting to access a novel food source can only learn through trial and error, while a social species can acquire information about successful strategies from its group mates.",

Cichlids are a highly speciose group that displays a range of social behaviours, with all species engaging in some form of parental care (Duponchelle, Paradis, Ribbink, & Turner, 2008; Whiteman & C\u00f4te, 2004) . One group of closely related cichlids, the Lamprologines, endemic to Lake Tanganyika, are especially useful models because many of these species have very similar ecologies and life histories yet are particularly socially diverse (Dey et al., 2017; Pollen et al., 2007) . Some species of this group are mostly solitary, while others live in pairs, in colonies, or even in obligate cooperatively breeding groups (Axelrod, 1993; Barlow, 1991; Brichard, 1989) . In this study, we focused mainly on two closely related Lamprologine cichlids: Neolamprologus pulcher and Telmatochromis temporalis. N. pulcher is a highly social, obligate cooperative breeder that lives in groups of up to 20 (Wong & Balshine, 2011) , whereas T. temporalis is more solitary, sometimes found living in breeding pairs, but does not tolerate other conspecifics in its territories (O'Connor, Marsh-Rollo, Aubin-Horth, & Balshine, 2016) . We also expanded our investigations of comparative cognition by testing two more cooperatively breeding group-living cichlids, N. multifasciatus and Julidochromis dickfeldi, and their most closely related more solitary relatives, Lamprologus meleagris and N. tretocephalus. We chose these species to be representative of the range of social behaviours and morphologies found across Lamprologine cichlids to ensure, as far as possible, that the developed protocol could be used in other species in the future. All of the species included maintain similar territories and have similar diets; however, N. pulcher feed primarily on midwater zooplankton, whereas T. temporalis typically scrape algae from rocks (aufwuchs), N. tretocephalus and L. meleagris feed on zoobenthos, N. mulifasciatus feed on zoobenthos and midwater zooplankton, and J. dickfeldi are omnivorous (Hori, Yamaoka, & Kenzi, 1983; Konings, 1998) .",

In Experiments 1 and 2, we tested individuals' abilities to learn to access a hidden food reward on a food tray. We used a common paradigm to test associative learning (Buechel, Boussard, Kotrschal, van Der Bijl, & Kolm, 2018; Lucon-Xiccato & Bisazza, 2014) , making these results comparable with other experimental findings and future experiments using this approach. In Experiment 2, we tested how single focal fish learned about food rewards under different social conditions to ascertain how the presence of a conspecific impacted learning in N. pulcher and T. temporalis. In Experiments 3 and 4, we tested individuals' abilities to learn about shelter. We expected shelter to be a particularly ecologically salient reward for both species because they both use shelters for predator avoidance and breeding under natural social conditions (Brown & Chivers, 2005; Coleman & Rosenthal, 2006; O'Connor, Reddon, Odetunde, Jindal, & Balshine, 2015 ). Overall, we tested two competing hypotheses. First, if sociality drives the evolution of cognitive ability, then the more-social N. pulcher (and N. multifasciatus and J. dickfeldi) should outperform the less-social T. temporalis (and L. meleagris and N. tretocephalus) in every learning task. Second, if the social environment provides more opportunities for learning (Muthukrishna & Henrich, 2016) , then the more-and less-social species should perform similarly when held under identical social conditions, as in Experiments 1 and 2, and the more-social species would only outperform the less-social species when held in natural social conditions, as in Experiments 3 and 4.",

When data did not meet the assumptions of normality and/or equal variance, data were log transformed; if the data could not be transformed to meet these assumptions, then equivalent nonparametric analyses were performed. Cox proportional hazard (PH) models were fit using the coxme package (Therneau, 2020a) , survival curve differences were tested using the survival package (Therneau, 2020b) , and Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) tests were performed using the emmeans package (Lenth, Singmann, Love, Buerkner, & Herve, 2019) .",

During the training and trials, opaque white acrylic feeding trays, 20 \u03eb 10 \u03eb 1 cm for the larger species and \u03eb 5 \u03eb 1 cm for the considerably smaller N. multifasciatus and L. meleagris, were placed in the front half of each aquarium. Each feeding tray had 10 wells (0.5 cm deep and either 2 cm or 1 cm in diameter corresponding to the size of the tray). While the feeding tray was being placed in the testing chamber of the aquaria, the view of the test fish into the test chamber was entirely obstructed by an opaque barrier. Each well of the feeding tray was loaded with a bloodworm (for the four larger species) or brine shrimp (for the two smaller species). Ten black acrylic disks (larger disks \u03ed cm diameter, 0.3 cm thick, 2.3 g; smaller disks \u03ed 1.5 cm diameter, 0.2 cm thick, 0.5 g) were placed on top of the trays and with the disks increasingly covering the food wells with the worms or shrimp as trials progressed ( Figure 1a ). Fish were trained over eight sessions. In Sessions 1-2, the disks were placed beside the food wells, but the worms or brine shrimp in the wells were completely visible. In Sessions 3-4, the disks covered one third of the well, while in Sessions 5-8, the disks covered two thirds of the well. Fish that never fed from any wells during training were considered to be training dropouts because they never engaged with the experimental apparatus (see results, Figure 1b ). All dropouts were excluded from the experiments, returned to stock aquaria, and monitored to ensure they fed immediately. Fish that reached the trial phase went through six trials where the disks completely covered the food wells (termed the test phase). All 10 wells had a food reward. Fish simply had to learn to remove the disk to reach the food.",

All models used species and sociality (more-or less-social) as fixed effects. As dropouts did not complete the test phase, they were included in each model with their response variable set either to the maximum (latency to uncover food and latency to first disk interaction) or minimum value (total number of food items eaten).

The possible interaction between housing and sociality might also account for the higher dropout rate and poor performance in the more-social N. multifasciatus and J. dickfeldi, respectively. Although there is widespread evidence that cognitive performance in social species is negatively affected by social isolation (Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009) , how social environments might differentially impact learning ability in more-and less-social species has not been widely addressed. Therefore, in this second experiment, we repeated Experiment 1 under three additional social conditions to explore the role of social environment in task performance in more-social N. pulcher and less-social T. temporalis. We predicted that the moresocial N. pulcher would perform better under more social conditions, whereas the less-social T. temporalis would perform worse with extra social stimuli.",

Therefore, to compare all social conditions and to control for any potential effects of these cues, we included the truly solitary/nonsocial condition N. pulcher and T. temporalis data from Experiment 1 in the analyses and figures. Hence, we compared performance in feeding trials across four social conditions: under the truly solitary holding conditions in Experiment 1 (focal fish never saw, smelled, or heard conspecifics), under an intermediate social condition (focal fish saw a conspecific during feeding trials only), under an always social condition (focal fish saw a conspecific at all times), and under a social control condition (a conspecific was always present but behind a barrier so could not be seen by the focal fish). We compared task performance by fitting Cox PH models to compare latencies to interact with the disks and uncover food using the interaction between species and social condition interaction as a fixed effect. We also fit a GLM to test whether N. pulcher accessed more food than T. temporalis using the same variable as above. As in Experiment 1, dropouts were included in each model with their response variable set either to the maximum (latency to uncover food and latency to first disk interaction) or minimum value (total number of food items eaten).",

We tested whether N. pulcher would be slower than T. temporalis to learn about a refuge. Further, as we found that social environment greatly influenced the learning ability of both species, in this experiment, we kept both species in their natural states during testing. Therefore, N. pulcher were held in cooperatively breeding groups, and T. temporalis were held in breeding pairs. Together, these changes allowed us to test learning under more natural conditions.",

N. pulcher were kept in groups with a breeding pair and several helpers (mean number of helpers \u03ed 2.5, SEM \u03ed 0.19). Fish were fin clipped for individual identification, with no adverse behavioural effect (Stiver, Dierkes, Taborsky, & Balshine, 2004) . Each group or pair was housed for the duration of testing in a 189L aquaria with a heater, two sponge filters and 3 cm of coral sand, and four shelters (two black PVC tubes [9.4 \u03eb 5.2 cm] and two terracotta flowerpot halves [9.4 \u03eb 5.2 cm]). In half of the trials, two tube shelters were placed on the left of the aquaria, and two pot shelters were placed on the right side; in the other half of the trials, the sides were switched. Half of the focal fish experienced accessible tubes (where fish could swim in), while the pots were inaccessible (sealed with clear acrylic; see Figure 3a ). In the other half of the trials, pots were accessible, and tubes were inaccessible. Hence, the positions of the shelters within the aquaria and the type of shelter that was accessible were counterbalanced across the species and trials. Each species was free to interact with the shelters for 24 hr prior to testing. Prior to testing, the aquaria sponge filters were removed so that the only places to hide were the experimental shelters. Following a 5-min acclimation, fish were startled by moving a net (20 \u03eb 15 cm) in a figure-eight motion three times at midwater (average duration of 6.3 s \u03ee 0.07 s). Startles occurred once per day for 7 days between 12:00 and 16:00 to control for diurnal effects, and the behaviour of the fish was recorded for 5 min on video.",

In this fourth experiment, we used 16 naive N. pulcher breeders held in groups (mean number of helpers \u03ed 2.4, SEM \u03ed 0.26) and 18 naive T. temporalis held as breeding pairs kept in the same conditions as described above for Experiment 3. However, in this experiment, the fish were not given any experimental shelters until after their minimum 24-hr acclimation period, and only tubes were used as shelter (two accessible tubes placed on one side of the tank and two inaccessible tubes placed on the opposite side in a coun-terbalanced alternating design; Figure 3c ). Before each trial, sponge filters were removed. At 90 and 270 min after the four tubes were placed in the aquaria, the fish were startled as described in Experiment 3.

Several studies have linked sociality to brain size (Dunbar, 1992; Finlay & Darlington, 1995; Joffe & Dunbar, 1997; Paw\u0142owski et al., 1998) and brain size to learning ability (Benson-Amram et al., 2016; Deaner et al., 2007; Lodato & Arlotta, 2015; Lui et al., 2011; MacLean et al., 2014; Sakai et al., 2016; Shultz & Dunbar, 2010 ), yet there is still limited direct research into the relationship between sociality and learning (Byrne & Bates, 2007; Hoppitt & Laland, 2013) . We explored two conflicting hypotheses. The first was that if sociality drives the evolution of cognitive ability (Dunbar, 1998; Dunbar & Shultz, 2007) , then more-social species should perform better on all learning tasks. The second was that if a more-social environment provides more opportunity for learning (Muthukrishna & Henrich, 2016) , then more-social species should perform better only when in natural social groups. To this end, we assessed whether sociality is a reliable predictor of associative learning ability in cichlid fishes across four experiments. Contrary to our predictions, in Experiment 1, we found evidence that less-social species outperformed more-social species in a foraging task; however, in Experiment 2, we found that the social environment during the foraging task significantly affected performance in both moreand less-social species. Specifically, T. temporalis outperformed N. pulcher in the truly solitary and most-social (conspecific always visible) conditions, whereas both species performed comparably in the intermediate social condition (conspecific visible only during trials) and N. pulcher outperformed T. temporalis in the social control condition (conspecific present but always invisible). Furthermore, Experiments 3 and 4 together suggest that the more-social N. pulcher learns faster than the less-social T. temporalis in a shelter use task. Specifically, under more natural social conditions, N. pulcher consistently learned to distinguish between accessible and inaccessible shelter more quickly (within 90 min; Experiment 4) than T. temporalis (more than 4.5 hr; Experiment 3).",

In other species, telencephalon and cerebellum volume, brain regions associated with higher-order cognition, such as learning (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2005; Salas, Broglio, & Rodr\u00edguez, 2003) , have been linked with both habitat complexity and indicators of sociality such as mating system (Gonzalez-Voyer & Kolm, 2010a; Pollen et al., 2007) .

Therefore, it is unlikely that reward differences account for the results of Experiment 1. However, as the design of Experiments 1 and 2 required individuals to feed from an apparatus near the bottom of the aquaria, this may have favoured T. temporalis as this species primarily eats algae (aufwuchs) from rock surfaces (Takamura, 1984) , whereas N. pulcher more commonly feed on zooplankton from the water column (M. Taborsky, 1984) . Conversely, N. tretocephalus is also a benthic feeder (Axelrod, 1993; Brichard, 1989 ), yet N. tretocephalus performed similarly to N. pulcher, indicating that differences in feeding habits were likely not major determinants of performance during this food-based learning task. However, the different proportions of fish of each species that failed to feed (dropouts) even when the food was not fully hidden in Experiments 1 and 2 may indicate that some species were consistently more stressed by the experimental conditions than others. Hence, each species' ability to perform the foraging task was potentially differently affected by the configuration of the task itself, thus constraining our ability to directly compare performance between each species. Stress experienced during, but out of context with, a learning event can impair memory (Jo\u00ebls, Pu, Wiegert, Oitzl, & Krugers, 2006) . This was the rationale behind extending the solitary condition of Experiment 1 into the multiple social conditions of Experiments 1 and 2 combined. Indeed, we found that social condition impacts foraging task performance for both N. pulcher and T. temporalis, although each species' performance was affected differently across social conditions.",

In the wild, N. pulcher share and likely compete for shelters with their group mates, which may make learning about shelters a more salient task for them than T. temporalis. Additionally, because they were held in pairs, T. temporalis had one accessible shelter for each fish per aquarium, whereas the N. pulcher that were held in groups had one accessible shelter between an average of 2.2 fish. Both factors could drive N. pulcher to learn about shelter quality more quickly. This was the motivation for focusing on the learning of only the breeding pair in both species; as N. pulcher breeders are the most dominant members of the group, competition for shelters should mainly affect the helpers (B. Taborsky, Arnold, Junker, & Tschopp, 2012) . In Experiments 3 and 4, N. pulcher potentially had greater exposure to social transmission and reinforcement between individuals. The N. pulcher in social groups could observe multiple conspecifics interacting with the experimental apparatus, whereas the T. temporalis in Experiments 3 and 4 could observe only one conspecific interacting with the experimental apparatus. Social transmission has been observed in several unrelated grouping and nongrouping fishes (Laland & Williams, 1998; Suboski et al., 1990; Webster & Laland, 2017) , demonstrating that many fishes likely have the ability to learn from conspecifics. However, behavioural cues from group mates may be more salient for N. pulcher, which live in large cooperatively breeding groups (Wong & Balshine, 2011) , than for T. temporalis, which commonly live as a breeding pair (O'Connor et al., 2016) . Hence, the more-social N. pulcher may be more attuned to the social environment and socially available information than the less-social T. temporalis, which may explain why N. pulcher outperformed T.",

While the potential interaction between dominance and learning was one of the motivating factors behind our focus on dominant breeders in Experiments 3 and 4, the housing conditions in Experiments 1 and 2 limited focal individuals' opportunities to interact with conspecifics and develop hierarchies. Therefore, an alternative explanation of these results could be that the more-social focal fish were more motivated to find conspecifics than to engage with and learn the foraging task, thereby reducing their performance in Experiments 1 and 2. In other words, the inability to interact with conspecifics (rather than a deficit of social information) may have resulted in less-social species outperforming more-social species in Experiment 1 and the lack of a clear difference between N. pulcher and T. temporalis in Experiment 2. That the truly solitary environment limited the more-social species' performance is supported by the difference in dropout rates between social conditions; in Experiment 2, N. pulcher were least likely to complete the solitary and intermediate social conditions, indicating stress or distraction from being solitary or being around an unfamiliar conspecific. Conversely, the most social condition, a conspecific always present, was the only social condition in which no N. pulcher, but some T. temporalis, failed to complete the trials. Presumably, a social relationship would have been able to be formed across a barrier when two individuals shared the space for so many days. However, direct physical interaction between focal and conspecific fish in Experiment 2 was not allowed because the close size and sex matching would promote potentially deadly aggression in the pair. For future comparative learning studies, the two aspects of being in a group, reduced stress due to social buffering (for group-living species; Culbert, Gilmour, & Balshine, 2019) and the ability to acquire information efficiently, should be decoupled.",

Conversely, we found that N. pulcher learned about shelter quality faster than T. temporalis. Overall, we found no evidence that more-social cichlids consistently perform better at these two learning tasks than less-social cichlids; therefore, these results do not support the hypothesis that sociality drives the evolution of cognitive ability. Conversely, our results do support the hypothesis that a moresocial environment provides more opportunities for learning as N. pulcher held in groups outperformed T. temporalis held in pairs (Experiments 3 and 4), whereas N. pulcher did not consistently outperform T. temporalis when both species were held in identical social conditions (Experiments 1 and 2). We also found that the social environment during testing and species' sociality interact to affect task performance in a foraging task. T. temporalis outperformed N. pulcher in the truly solitary and most-social (conspecific always visible) conditions, but both species performed comparably in the intermediate social condition (conspecific visible only during trials), and N. pulcher outperformed T. temporalis in the social control condition (conspecific present but always invisible), warranting further investigation into the impact of sociality on learning ability. Use of more cognitively demanding tasks, such as reversal learning, could help further discriminate between differences across species' cognitive task performances and might reveal clearer performance differences between species and individuals (Buechel et al., 2018) . Our findings emphasise the importance of standardising social environments relative to the test species' natural social landscape, as well as the need to minimise the distraction that extraneous conspecifics may provide during testing. Although we were not able to show that more-social cichlid species have a greater general capacity for learning when compared to less-social species, we have devised learning paradigms that can easily be applied to other cichlid species for further comparative experiments. Cichlids are an ideal group for further testing because they are a speciose group with many closely related species that have highly varied social lives despite living in rather similar ecological environments (Dey et al., 2017) .",

Par cons\u00e9quent, les esp\u00e8ces plus sociales pourraient apprendre plus rapidement que les esp\u00e8ces moins sociales. L'objectif de cette \u00e9tude \u00e9tait de mettre au point un cadre d'apprentissage pour tester la fa\u00e7on dont les poissons-cichlid\u00e9s Lamprologus plus et moins sociaux se comportent dans le cadre de t\u00e2ches d'apprentissage associatif. Ces cichlid\u00e9s sont un groupe d'esp\u00e8ces \u00e9troitement li\u00e9es avec des \u00e9cologies et des historiques de vie similaires, mais avec des degr\u00e9s variables de sociabilit\u00e9, ce qui en fait un groupe id\u00e9al pour les \u00e9tudes d'apprentissage comparatives. Nous avons constat\u00e9 que trois cichlid\u00e9s non regroup\u00e9s (Telmatochromis temporalis, Lamprologus meleagris, et Neolamprologus tretocephalus) ont surpass\u00e9 trois cichlid\u00e9s tr\u00e8s sociaux, \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s et se reproduisant en coop\u00e9ration (N. pulcher, N. multifasciatus et Julidochromis dwickfeldi) dans une t\u00e2che d'apprentissage associatif bas\u00e9e sur les r\u00e9compenses alimentaires. Cependant, nous avons \u00e9mis l'hypoth\u00e8se que ces diff\u00e9rences peuvent \u00eatre caus\u00e9es par l'environnement social pendant les tests et pourraient ne pas refl\u00e9ter de r\u00e9elles diff\u00e9rences cognitives. En effet, lorsque nous avons creus\u00e9 et compar\u00e9 seulement deux esp\u00e8ces dans quatre conditions sociales diff\u00e9rentes, nous avons constat\u00e9 que l'environnement social pendant les essais d'apprentissage avait une incidence diff\u00e9rente sur le rendement de l'esp\u00e8ce tr\u00e8s sociale, N. pulcher et de l'esp\u00e8ce moins sociale, T. temporalis. Nous avons ensuite r\u00e9alis\u00e9 d'autres exp\u00e9riences avec N. pulcher et T. temporalis dans des milieux sociaux plus naturels. Dans ces conditions sociales plus naturelles, nous avons d\u00e9couvert que N. pulcher avait appris \u00e0 distinguer les abris accessibles et inaccessibles plus rapidement que T. temporalis. Ces r\u00e9sultats soulignent le potentiel d'\u00e9largir les exp\u00e9riences comparatives en \u00e9tudiant la relation entre la sociabilit\u00e9 et la cognition et mettent l'accent sur le r\u00f4le crucial que joue l'environnement social dans les r\u00e9sultats d'apprentissage.",

An increase in temperature, or in the abundance of V. coralliilyticus, can turn this association pathogenic, causing tissue lysis, expulsion of the corals' symbiotic algae (genus Symbiodinium), and eventually coral death. Using a combination of microfluidics, fluorescence microscopy, stable isotopes, electron microscopy and NanoSIMS isotopic imaging, we provide insights into the onset and progression of V. coralliilyticus infection in the daytime and at night, at the tissue and (sub-)cellular level. The objective of our study was to connect the macro-scale behavioural response of the coral to the micro-scale nutritional interactions that occur between the host and its symbiont. In the daytime, polyps enhanced their mucus production, and actively spewed pathogens. Vibrio infection primarily resulted in the formation of tissue lesions in the coenosarc. NanoSIMS analysis revealed infection reduced C-assimilation in Symbiodinium, but increased 13 C-assimilation in the host. In the night incubations, no mucus spewing was observed, and a mucus film was formed on the coral surface. Vibrio inoculation and infection at night showed reduced C-turnover in Symbiodinium, but did not impact host 13 C-turnover. Our results show that both the nutritional interactions that occur between the two symbiotic partners and the behavioural response of the host organism play key roles in determining the progression and severity of host-pathogen interactions. More generally, our approach provides a new means of studying interactions (ranging from behavioural to metabolic scales) between partners involved in complex holobiont systems, under both homoeostatic and pathogenic conditions.",

One single, relatively large reef-building coral colony contains billions of dinoflagellate algae, bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses [2] [3] [4] [5] , that are collectively known as the coral holobiont [6] . The relationship between the coral animal and its endosymbiotic dinoflagellate population (genus Symbiodinium) has become emblematic of mutualistic symbiosis in the marine environment. Symbiodinium cells live intracellularly within coral cells and provide the coral animal with a reliable food source via translocation of photosynthates and their immediate derivatives (sugars, lipids, and amino acids [7] [8] [9] ). Concurrently, corals host a diverse array of bacteria, both in a thin layer of mucus on the surface of the coral [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] and deeper within their tissues and skeleton [15] .",

                "text": "Coral-dinoflagellate and coral-bacteria interactions are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in seawater temperature. Elevated temperature is known to perturb the allocation of carbon and nitrate between Symbiodinium and their host [16] [17] [18] , but the mechanisms responsible for these perturbations are debated. Shifts in the coral microbiome also occur during periods of thermal stress [19] . One of the most consistent changes reported is a sharp increase in bacteria belonging to the genus Vibrio. This genus is present in the microbiome of healthy corals at low densities [20] [21] [22] , but increases in abundance by several orders of magnitude under elevated temperature [23] . One species, V. coralliilyticus, is particularly responsive to these fluctuations [23, 24] . It is best known as the aetiological agent of bacterial-bleaching in Pocillopora damicornis [25] [26] [27] , but is also present in other coral diseases, including \"white syndrome\" [28, 29] and black band disease [30] . Both the virulence [28] and antimicrobial resistance [31] of V. coralliilyticus are strongly correlated with temperature. Under high temperatures, V. coralliilyticus genes involved in motility, resistance, and host degradation are up-regulated [32] , increasing the pathogens' speed and accuracy of finding suitable coral targets [33] . This Vibrio uses dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a compound produced by both the coral animal and its algal symbiont [34] , to locate physiologically-stressed corals [35, 36] . Once contact is made, the pathogen enters the polyp via its mouth or through tears in the coral's tissue [37] . Inside the polyp, V. coralliilyticus cells divide [27] and secrete enzymatic proteins that help them attach to-and penetrate deeper into the tissues. One group of proteins, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), are thought to play a particularly important role in infection dynamics [26, 38, 39] , by causing tissue lesion formation [38] and affecting the photosynthetic efficiency of the algal symbiont [40, 41] .",

In part, this is due to the complexity of quantifying the flux of metabolites between the three partners in the holobiont (the bacteria, the dinoflagellate and the host). Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) [42] combined with isotopicallylabelled seawater ( 13 C-enriched bicarbonate) permits the tracing of assimilated and translocated carbon between the algal symbionts and their host [9, 16, 43] . It also facilitates the visualization of isotopically-labelled pathogens and/or their degradation/secretion products within coral tissue [37, 44] . Here, we combine these two approaches in a first case study of the P. damicornis-V. coralliilyticus model. By using 15 N-labelled bacteria and 13 C-labelled seawater, we are able to determine if the presence of pathogens influences resource partitioning in the coral holobiont. Specifically, we quantify: (1) 13 C-assimilation in Symbiodinium and the amount of 13 C-labelled photosynthates that are assimilated by the host; (2) the metabolic turnover of C in Symbiodinium and in their host and (3) the incorporation of bacterial-derived N within the tissues of the coral holobiont.",

After one week, the fragments were transported to Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot, Israel) and placed in a custom-built raceway system containing 0.22 \u03bcm-filtered seawater (FSW) [45] . Temperature (28.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C) was controlled using a 25 W aquarium heater (Aqua Medic), while light (150 \u03bcmol photons m \u22122 s \u22121 , 13.5 h light: 10.5 h dark) was provided by blue and white LEDs. Distilled water was added to the system on a daily basis to compensate for any water lost through evaporation and to prevent fluctuations in salinity. Fragments were maintained in the set-up for a maximum of 3 weeks while experiments were conducted. Three days before the start of each experiment, ten fragments were selected at random and transferred to a second raceway system held under the same light regime but at elevated temperatures (31.0 \u00b1 1.0\u00b0C). Experimental fragments were selected after visual confirmation of health (i.e., skeleton completely covered by tissue, polyps extended, no paling of the coenosarc, and no excess mucus production).",

Each micro-chamber had an individual inlet and outlet tube (\u00d8 = 0.8 mm). Inlet tubes were placed in Corning cell culture flasks containing the desired source water (specified in the experimental design, below) and outlet tubes were connected to an 8-channel peristaltic pump (MRC, Holon, Israel), which was in turn, connected to a fraction collector (Gilson Inc. Middleton, WI, USA). The peristaltic pump ensured that flow rates (~2.6 mL h \u22121 ) were stable between micro-chambers and experiments, while the fraction collector allowed collection and further analysis of effluent characteristics.",

Two fragments were challenged with the inoculum (~10 8 cells mL \u22121 of 15 N-labelled V. coralliilyticus), suspended in 13 C-labelled FSW. The other fragments acted as non-challenged metabolic controls, and were therefore exposed solely to C-labelled FSW. The very high experimental Vibrio inoculation density was chosen to elicit an infection response within a reasonably short time frame [37, 39, 45] to be compatible with the conducted isotopic-labelling experiments and thus emphasizes the mechanistic point of view rather than representing an ecologically relevant scenario. Inoculation lasted 2 h, after which all fragments were supplied with pathogen-free 13 C-labelled FSW. Images of coral fluorescence were taken at four fixed positions on the coral surface, every 10 min throughout the experiment. Fluorescence was captured in three channels, which allowed us to monitor the response of the coral host (green fluorescent protein; [GFP] Ex: 490 nm, Em: 535 \u00b1 50 nm), Symbiodinium (chlorophyll; Ex: 490 nm, Em: 660 \u00b1 50 nm), and V. coralliilyticus (DsRed; Ex: 555 \u00b1 20 nm, Em: 590 \u00b1 33 nm).

Note that the embedment of material in plastic resin dilutes the signal of carbon, and thus yields lower C levels during the subsequent NanoSIMS analysis [46] . The values we measured should thus be considered minimal estimates of carbon enrichment. To minimize the variability of this, all samples were embedded using the same batch of resin, under the same conditions. Our measured values were subsequently expressed as atom percent excess (APE, in %). This first required the conversion of the measured 13 C 12 C \u2212 / 12 C 12 C \u2212 or 15 N 12 C \u2212 / 14 N 12 C \u2212 ratios in the sample (R sample ) and in the unlabelled sample, (R control ) into fractions (eq. 1; where X is either the sample or the control [47] ).",

This was followed by repeated expansion and contraction of the polyps, causing the spewing of large amounts of bacterialaden mucus from the polyp mouth ( Fig. 2a) . Interestingly, the one fragment that did not develop lesions (i.e. was asymptomatic) appeared to release mucus over a longer time period (Video S8). All symptomatic fragments developed lesions in the coenosarc tissue ( Fig. 2a ), but timing of lesion formation differed between fragments. One developed lesions after~200 min (fixed at 3.5 h postinoculation [hpi]; Video S5), while two developed lesions after~300 min (fixed at 9 and 9.5 hpi, respectively; Videos S6, S7). The asymptomatic fragment was fixed at the end of the light period (i.e. at 13.5 hpi; Video S8). Analysis of the system effluents revealed that the number of V. coralliilyticus cells retained by fragments during the first 30 min of inoculation (when polyps were contracted) was similar in all fragments (~80% of the inoculum; Fig. 2b , left axis). Ninety minutes after the start of the inoculation however (after spewing had begun), there was a disparity between the fragments with regards to the number of bacteria retained within the system (which ranged from 20 to 62%; Fig. 2b, left axis) . There was no difference in the amount of V. coralliilyticus in the effluent post-inoculation (i.e. Vibrio were washed out of all chambers at similar rates; Fig. 2b, right axis) . MMP activity levels in the effluent followed a similar trend to the bacterial density data; peaking during inoculation and then declining throughout the experiment (Fig. 2c) .",

Addition of V. coralliilyticus triggered polyp contraction, but subsequent mucus spewing was not observed. Instead, a mucus film formed on the surface of the fragments~60 min into the inoculation period ( Fig. 3a ) and continued to persist there for the duration of the experiment ( Fig. 3a ; Videos S11, S12). In one symptomatic fragment, structures resembling nematocysts (specialised stinging organelles used in selfdefence or prey capture) covered in pathogens were 13 C between non-challenged and V. coralliilyticus-challenged corals (see Table 1 for statistical output). Note 13 C-enrichment levels were not detectable (n.d.) in the host tissue of the fragment fixed after 3.5 h of incubation. e, g NanoSIMS analysis of the hourly 15 N-enrichment in (e) Symbiodinium and (g) host tissue in V. coralliilyticus-challenged corals. Asterisks denote significant changes (p < 0.05) in hourly APE N between incubation times (see Table 2 for statistical output) observed being fired after~350 min (Video S12). In both infected fragments, the chlorophyll signal emanating from individual Symbiodinium cells was observed to peak and then fade quickly, producing a sort of 'fluorescent flash'. The timing of elevation in chlorophyll fluorescence differed between individual cells, but was synchronized between regions on the surface, generating the impression of a wave traversing the surface of the coral (Videos S11, S12). Fragments were fixed at 4.5 and 6.5 hpi, respectively, for NanoSIMS analysis.",

In the first experiment, where inoculation occurred during the light period, fragments expanded their polyps shortly after the initial contraction and rhythmic retraction and expansion were observed, accompanied by spewing of bacteria-laden mucus from the pharynx region. This behaviour was then followed by changes in tissue morphology and confluence and lesions began appearing on the coral surface. It is possible that coral fragments with polyps that were more efficient at spewing mucus, developed surface lesions later. We attempted to quantify the development of lesions using image analysis, but the topography of the surface and the timing between images made it difficult to accurately distinguish between polyp movement and induced tissue damage ( Supplementary Information, Fig. S3 ). Lesions, however, always began in the coenosarc tissue immediately surrounding the polyp, irrespective of the timing of their development. It is unclear whether the coenosarc is specifically targeted by V. coralliilyticus or whether the tissues in this area are simply thinner than other areas of the coral surface, and thus, more susceptible to penetration and tearing. Regardless, this finding supports the hypothesis of \"polyp bail-out\", as a host-mediated defence strategy to escape an undesirable environmental condition or the onset of disease [39, 50] . In addition, the observed responses here should be viewed in the context of a high inoculum density as previous experiments have shown that V. coralliilyticus densities of 10 6 or 10 7 cells mL \u22121 take much longer to manifest a state of disease [27, 39, 41] .",

As a result, coral epithelia (inner and outer surfaces) are likely exposed to Vibrio for longer periods of time, which may explain the high in hospite pathogen density observed in these fragments by STEM and NanoSIMS. Observations of mucus film formation have not previously been published for P. damicornis-V. coralliilyticus interactions, but have been observed in previous infections conducted in the Coral-on-a-Chip microfluidics system (Shapiro, Gavish personal communication). The source of this phenomena cannot be attributed solely to light/dark dynamics, as some experiments conducted by Gavish et al. under dark conditions were more similar to the light infections observed here [39] . The difference may thus be attributed either to host genotype or to some uncontrolled stress incurred by the host prior to the infection which affected the observed phenotype.",

This could be linked to the behavioural response that we observed. Mucus spewing, and mucus production in general, is energetically costly [57] . A coral 'under attack' is thus likely to have a higher demand for energy and, hence, translocated carbon to support the extra energy-consumption triggered by this defence mechanism. Although physiological data (i.e. photosynthetic and respiratory rates) were not obtained in this study, we suggest that Symbiodinium in V. coralliilyticus-challenged corals fix carbon at a higher rate than in nonchallenged corals, in order to facilitate the increase in carbon that is translocated to their host. Consistent with this, our data show that Symbiodinium cells in three out of the four fragments (originating from two mother colonies) that were challenged in the light, allocated less carbon to anabolic processes than Symbiodinium in control corals, despite remaining structurally intact (Figs. 2d, 4b) . It is possible that this reflects a general reduction in Symbiodinium metabolism, and thus, slower cell turnover.",

This is not particularly surprising, because symbiont cells in the infected corals were severely necrotic ( Fig. 4e ) and were thus not likely dividing or metabolically functional at the time of fixation. What happened in the host tissue however, is less clear. In one fragment (fixed at 4.5 h) host turnover was faster under the challenge of Vibrio than the control (Fig. 3f) , but in the other (fixed at 6.5 h), there was no difference. Interpreting this data is complicated by the severe disintegration of the host tissue and the fact that labelled material (such as lipid droplets) were observed leaking from some necrotic Symbiodinium cells, which could have contributed to the C-signal measured in the host tissue (Fig. 4e) . One important observation that arose from the dark inoculations was that the pathogens themselves are able to assimilate host-derived carbon (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2A ), probably as dissolved organic material (DOM) following the dissociation of the host tissue. MMPs are thought to play a key role in this process [39, 40] . This could be proven by repeating our experiments using a vcpA-mutant strain of V. coralliilyticus, which has been genetically-modified to block MMP production [40] .",

The 15 N signal encompasses both intact bacteria and their degradation products [37] . This makes it impossible to compare values in the host tissue, because of the very different amounts of bacteria observed in hospite. We can compare the N signal in Symbiodinium because intact V. coralliilyticus were unable to penetrate the thick cell wall that surrounds the cell (Figs. 4, 5) . Therefore, any 15 N present in Symbiodinium represents the products of bacterial degradation, assimilated via one of two mechanisms: either directly, as organic metabolites (e.g. amino acids) or indirectly, after the internal recycling of ammonia [59, 60] . The reduction in 15 Nassimilation by Symbiodinium that we observed in the dark suggests 15 N-fixation is coupled with photosynthesis [9] and is thus, derived predominantly from ammonia recycling. The low rates of 15 N assimilated in the dark however, confirms that both metabolic pathways are active and used during infection.",

It is tempting to propose that the observed defence responses (increased mucus production and the active spewing of mucus) are fuelled by an increased amount of photosynthates translocated from the symbiont to the host. However, at this point our results should be viewed within the context of the limited number of colonies tested here, the high inoculum density, and the contrasting observations from previous experiments.",

Developing microfluidic chips fitted with integrated oxygen sensors is certainly a feasible target for the field of coral research in the near-future, given that such chips already exist for algae [61, 62] and cyanobacteria [63] . But, studying the response of a complex holobiont to infectious pathogens, or indeed any other physico/chemical disturbance (temperature, salinity and pH), poses a much greater challenge than single-celled organisms. This is where the combination of microfluidics and NanoSIMS stable isotopic imaging provides new opportunities. Microfluidics allows manipulation of the input source, the conditions on stage and the collection of the effluent for biochemical analysis, while NanoSIMS imaging enables us to assign functional roles to all members of the holobiont (in terms of metabolism). Together, these techniques have the potential to help answer some of the most fundamental questions standing in coral reef research: How does the coral immune system function? What is the tipping point for the transition between health and disease? And, how will the coral holobiont respond to multiple stressors in the face of climate change [64] ?",

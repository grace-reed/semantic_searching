To test the quality of the dissociated cells, we performed three assays to evaluate their cell viability. All three assays demonstrated that cell viability was good after incubating in a high-salinity solution. We also used two other octocorals, Paralemnalia thyrsoides and Sinularia compressa, to perform the same experiment, and the results were similar to those for Sinularia flexibilis. Therefore, a high-salinity-induced increase in the SGC ratio is a common phenomenon among octocorals.

                "text": "Corals have many different types of cells, including ciliated column, secretory, cnidocyte, flagellated columnar, cuboidal, absorptive, squamous, anchoring, flagellated cuboidal, spindle-shaped, sensory, motor neuron, interneuron, and neurosecretory cells [4, 5] . The most critical cells for cnidariandinoflagellate endosymbiosis are the host cells that house algal cells, also called symbiotic gastrodermal cells (SGCs). SGCs exist in the endoderm of cnidarians and in the main cells where symbiotic relationships occur. Many studies have investigated the mechanism of cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis using SGCs, and it would be necessary to first isolate SGCs from stony corals (Euphyllia glabrescens) at the beginning of such studies. To do so, researchers have explored two different methods [6, 7] . The function of the SGC membrane has also been discussed. Some studies have found that SGC membrane trafficking increases the susceptibility of algal symbionts to photo-inhibition [8] , and SGC membranes are involved in the recognition and phagocytosis of Symbiodiniaceae [9, 10] . The proteomic and ultrastructural of the lipid body in SGCs have also been studied by Peng et al. [11] . Our group studies the proteomics of SGCs. We isolated SGCs from stony corals (Euphyllia glabrescens) and labeled them using biotin-XX sulfosuccinimidyl ester to study the cell surface proteins. We identified 19 proteins that involved cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis [12] . Furthermore, we used SGCs as an antigen to generate antibodies and produced a new monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes clade C (now renamed Cladocopium) [13] symbionts, but not their free-living counterparts or other Symbiodiniacea. The monoclonal proteins recognizable by the antibody are symbiotic markers for Cladocopium symbionts, whose expression levels vary depending on the health status of corals [14] . Accordingly, SGC membranes may regulate the stability of the host coral and dinoflagellates. SGCs also play a vital role in cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis.",

                "text": "The discussion on the endosymbiotic mechanism of cnidarians and dinoflagellates has mostly involved stony corals (e.g., Euphyllia glabrescens) [11, [15] [16] [17] [18] or sea anemones (e.g., Exaiptasia pallida) [19] [20] [21] [22] as the animal models. Sea anemones have often been used as the model species in symbiosis research because they can be completely bleached and survive without algal cells through heterotrophy [20, 22, 23] (feeding on brine shrimp, Artemia). No studies have mentioned the endosymbiotic mechanism of octocoral and dinoflagellates. For years, people have thought that stony corals have immense skeleton-and reef-building capabilities and that their skeletons form an important habitat for coral reef organisms, while octocorals do not. Therefore, the importance of octocorals has been neglected. However, in a 2011 study, it was confirmed that octocorals (Sinularia) have the ability to cement sclerites and consolidate them at their base into spiculite, thus making them reef builders [24] . This study deepens the understanding of the importance of octocorals in coral reef ecosystems. It is evident that octocorals also play an important role in the entire coral reef ecosystem. In addition, octocorals are the second most common benthic component on many shallow reefs and a major component on deep reefs (mesophotic coral-reef ecosystems) in the Red Sea [25] . However, research on octocorals-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis is very rare, and no one has used octocorals as an animal model to study endosymbiosis. Scleractinian coral and octocoral are two different types of corals. We aim to compare these two and study the octocorals-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis by incorporating our experiences with the scleractinian corals. As mentioned above, SGCs play a vital role in cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis, and collecting SGCs to study the cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis is required. However, as we tried to collect SGCs from the octocoral Sinularia flexibilis following Khalesi's paper, we found the amount of intact SGCs was very small. Therefore, we developed a quick and easy method for collecting large amounts of SGCs from octocorals. We hope that this method can help researchers pay closer attention to octocorals and study SGCs with more ease.",

We now wanted to establish a new model system using octocorals as an animal model to study the endosymbiotic relationship between octocorals and dinoflagellates. Our first step was to collect the SGCs from octocorals. In our husbandry center, many cultures of the octocoral S. flexibilis are available, and many compounds isolated from S. flexibilis are potential drugs. For this reason, we chose S. flexibilis as our experimental organism. Initially, we used the methods mentioned by Khalesi [26] to dissociate cells from S. flexibilis, but only a small amount of intact SGCs were observed (less than 5%), while host cells and algal cells accounted for the majority of the dissociated cells (more than 90%). It was difficult for us to collect a sufficient amount of SGCs for the experiments. To solve this problem, we attempted many ways to obtain more intact SGCs from S. flexibilis. After testing the various methods over one year, we found that incubating the tentacles of S. flexibilis overnight in high-salinity (60% ) filtered seawater (FSW) resulted in many SGCs auto-releasing from the tentacles (Figure 1 ). This finding provided us with a new approach for collecting SGCs from octocorals. cells and algal cells accounted for the majority of the dissociated cells (more than 90%).

First, we incubated the detached cells in fluorescent dextran to detect the membrane intactness. If the cell membrane is damaged, fluorescent dextran will enter the cell, causing the cell cytosol to fluoresce green, as seen in the positive image at the lower right corner of Figure 5A . In contrast, if the cell membrane is intact, then the cytosol will be dark and without any fluorescence. In Figure 5A , the images at the upper right and middle right positions show that all of the SGC cytosols were dark, demonstrating that the SGC membrane was intact after incubating in high-salinity FSW. The green spots in the symbiotic algae in Figure 5A were caused by the autofluorescence of the accumulation body and not by the dextran. Second, we used the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to test the mitochondrial activity of the detached cells in 60% FSW. Unexpectedly, the viability of cells treated with 60% FSW was not reduced; rather, it was higher than that under the 36% FSW ( Figure 5B) . High salinity not only does not reduce cell viability, but increases cell viability approximately twofold. We repeated the experiment three times, and all replicates provided the same results. Therefore, we performed a third assay to confirm cell viability. We detected the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activity of the detached cells in the 60% FSW and the 36% FSW. Cell death (especially apoptosis) is a process that consumes energy, so ATP activity was used as an indicator of cell viability. When cell death occurs, ATP activity decreases because dead cells no longer perform basic metabolic functions. As predicted, we obtained results similar to those in the MTT assay. The ATP activity of cells treated with 60% FSW was higher than that of cells treated with 36% FSW ( Figure 5C ). In summary, the results from the above three analyses ( Figure 5A-C) confirm that the detached cells are intact and that the cell viability is good after incubating in a high-salinity solution. ",

As we expected, high salinity increased both the number and the ratio of SGCs released from these two octocorals ( Figures 6 and 7) . For P. thyrsoides, the highest ratio of SGCs was released from the tentacles treated with 50\u2030 FSW for 6 h ( Figure 7A,B) .

Although different types of octocorals have different optimal conditions, high salinity can indeed increase the ratio of SGCs released from these three octocorals. We also performed the same experiment with two scleractinian In a previous study [26] , Khalesi tried three ways to dissociate cells from S. flexibilis and used different media to culture these cells, including coral cells and symbionts. When he used a mechanical dissociation process, he observed some coral cells with their endosymbionts (what we call SGCs), but these were very low in number in his Figure 3B . In his observations, he did not mention the ratios of different types of cells. According to his Figure 3C , most cells were zooxanthellae cells, few were coral cells, and SGCs were even harder to find. In his experiment, some conditions could produce large amounts of cells, but the cells did not grow. In our experiment, the viability of cells treated with the 60% FSW was twofold higher than that of those treated with the 36% FSW ( Figure 5B ). This new method can increase cell viability and provides a new approach for culturing coral cells, zooxanthellae cells, or SGCs from octocorals.",

We performed the same experiment on two species of octocorals, P. thyrsoides and S. compressa.

We also performed the same experiment with two scleractinian corals, E. glabrescens and Pocillopora damicornis, but no SGCs were observed, and the tentacles rotted after incubating in the high-salinity solution (data not shown). Therefore, a high-salinity-induced increase in the SGC ratio is a common phenomenon among the three octocorals, but not the scleractinian corals. This result also implies that the octocorals and scleractinian corals may have different regulation mechanisms for osmotic pressure or different tolerance levels for osmotic pressure changes. The maximum number of SGCs from the three octocorals came from the tentacles treated with 50% -60% FSW; these results implied that the intracellular osmotic pressures in the SGCs of S. flexibilis, P. thyrsoides, and S. compressa may be closer to 1500-1800 mOsm rather than the normal seawater osmotic pressure (approximately mOsm).

Current technology cannot measure intracellular osmotic pressures in SGCs, but this special phenomenon is worthy of further research and future discussions. All cells must constantly adjust their cell volume to maintain the equilibrium between intracellular and extracellular osmolarity, a process known as osmoregulation [40] . In SGCs, osmoregulation is complicated. The host must balance its extracellular osmolarity with an intracellular environment that is influenced by both its own metabolism and that of its symbionts. Our results imply that the osmoregulation in octocorals obviously differs from that in scleractinian corals. The endosymbiotic relationship in octocorals and scleractinian corals may also be different. It has been demonstrated that symbiotic zooxanthellae live within an osmotically different environment from that of free-living dinoflagellates [41] . Previous studies have demonstrated that high salinity induces glycerol production in cultured Symbiodiniaceae [42] and that high salinity also induces Symbiodiniaceae to produce high levels of floridoside both in vitro and in hospite [43] . Therefore, osmoregulation may be affected by cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis. The detailed mechanism is worthy of further study. The tentacles of (A) P. thyrsoides and (B) S. compressa were incubated overnight in the control FSW (36% ) and high-salinity FSW (50% or 55% ) and then cut into small pieces. The released cells were observed via microscopy (400\u00d7). The arrowheads indicate the SGCs. The tentacles of (A) P. thyrsoides and (C) S. compressa were incubated overnight in FSW of different salinities. The tentacles of (B) P. thyrsoides and (D) S. compressa were incubated in 50% or 55% FSW over different time courses. Zx: zooxanthellae.",

                "text": "All cells must constantly adjust their cell volume to maintain the equilibrium between intracellular and extracellular osmolarity, a process known as osmoregulation [40] . In SGCs, osmoregulation is complicated. The host must balance its extracellular osmolarity with an intracellular environment that is influenced by both its own metabolism and that of its symbionts. Our results imply that the osmoregulation in octocorals obviously differs from that in scleractinian corals. The endosymbiotic relationship in octocorals and scleractinian corals may also be different. It has been demonstrated that symbiotic zooxanthellae live within an osmotically different environment from that of free-living dinoflagellates [41] . Previous studies have demonstrated that high salinity induces glycerol production in cultured Symbiodiniaceae [42] and that high salinity also induces Symbiodiniaceae to produce high levels of floridoside both in vitro and in hospite [43] . Therefore, osmoregulation may be affected by cnidarian-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis. The detailed mechanism is worthy of further study.",

These cells were filtered with a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer to remove any large tissue fragments, and the filtrate was collected in a centrifuge tube. The filtrate was centrifuged at 700 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in FSW. The cells were ready to be observed and photographed under a light microscope. More than 20 photographs were randomly captured under various salinities of FSW. Using a light microscope, we could see three types of cells. The white transparent cells were the host cells, the brown cells were the Symbiodiniaceae cells, and the brown cells living inside the white cells were the SGCs. The numbers of SGCs and Symbiodiniaceae cells were counted using Adobe Photoshop CS6, and host cells were not included in the calculations (the number of the host cells was much higher than the numbers of SGCs and Symbiodiniaceae cells). Under each condition, more than 1000 cells were counted, and the percentage of SGCs was calculated. Photoshop can count the number of cells and label serial numbers automatically. Any errors were fixed manually to get the correct number of SGCs and Symbiodiniaceae cells. The ratio of SGCs was calculated by dividing the number of SGC by the sum of SGCs and Symbiodiniaceae cells.",

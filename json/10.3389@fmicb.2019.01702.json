Despite being filtered with 0.4 \u00b5m pore-sized membranes, the flow-589 through water in the experimental system contained some bacteria (as shown by the 16S rRNA gene 590 sequences found in water samples). However, the water-associated microbial communities were considerably divergent from the coral microbiota ( Supplementary Figure S5) , which emphasizes the ability of corals to select certain bacteria from the environment. Alternatively, adult A. tenuis and P. 593 daedalea may have vertically transmitted some bacterial symbionts to their offspring prior to 5).

Inocula could be prepared by encapsulating bacteria into microscopic 686 feed particles (Peixoto et al. 2017) . Alternatively, probiotic bacteria could be administered through 687 a heterotrophic food source such as the brine shrimp Artemia, which has already proven successful 688 in spiny lobster larvae (Goulden et al. 2012) . As the delivery of probiotics to entire reef systems 689 could be unmanageable due to their large size as compared to available resources, efforts could be 690 prioritized to most vulnerable or ecologically relevant sites.",

It is indeed argued 693 that coral reef ecosystems might be inadvertently harmed through manipulations that we cannot This study involved the co-culturing of two taxonomically divergent coral species and inoculating 710 them with a bacterial cocktail generated in the laboratory. Despite sharing the same environment 711 since a very early life stage, A. tenuis and P. daedalea recruits had distinct bacterial communities at 712 the time of sampling, which exhibited different responses to the inocula. In the absence of 713 confounding factors such as environmental parameters and algal symbiont type, our findings As the microbiomes of A. tenuis and P. daedalea changed in response to the inoculum, the bacteria present in the cocktail were identified as the ones driving the main differences between inoculated 717 and control corals. The bacterial pool surrounding these young recruits therefore also influenced 718 their microbiomes. The long-term maintenance and stability of inoculated bacteria in corals still 719 need to be characterized. By demonstrating the feasibility to manipulate the coral microbiome in a laboratory setting, our results provide hope for the application of probiotics in coral reef conservation and restoration. ",

Fragments of the coral Mussismilia hartii were inoculated 128 with a bacterial consortium able to degrade water-soluble oil fractions, which reduced the negative 129 impact of a simulated oil spill on the experimental corals (dos Santos et al. 2015). In another 130 laboratory experiment, bacterial strains were selected for putatively beneficial traits including 131 nutrient cycling, antioxidative capacities, and antagonistic activities against pathogens (Rosado et 132 al. 2018). Inoculation of Pocillopora damicornis nubbins with the resulting consortium was able to 133 partially mitigate coral bleaching and alleviate pathogenic infection (Rosado et al. 2018). Thus, 134 coral bacterial community composition seems to be flexible to some extent and adjustable to benefit 135 the host. Finally, a single exposure of coral larvae to the mucus-associated microbes of four 136 different coral species resulted in divergent prokaryotic communities after four months of rearing in 137 filter-sterilized seawater (Damjanovic et al. 2017). Even though the initial inoculum composition 138 was not characterized, this experiment showed that coral-associated microbiomes could be 139 influenced to develop in distinct directions following microbial dosing. Early coral life stages may 140 be particularly suitable for targeted microbial inoculation, as the microbial composition and cell 141 density in the surrounding environment strongly influences the microbiome acquired by juvenile 142 corals"

Effective inoculations were 612 thus not precluded by using bacteria isolated from non-coral organisms, which demonstrates a 613 degree of flexibility in the coral microbiome. Altogether, this study supports the proof-of-concept 614 for the feasibility of manipulating coral-associated prokaryotes (dos Santos et al. 2015; Rosado et insights into the efficacy of probiotics for coral reef restoration and conservation, 620 future research should target several aspects not covered in the present study. First, an optimal 621 inoculation regime should be developed through the determination of suitable inoculation frequency 622and bacterial cell density. In the present work, the seven inoculations at 10 5 -10 6 cells/mL arbitrarily 623 followed a 3-4-3-4 days pattern, as no standard procedure has yet been established. Alternative624 strategies have also yielded effective outcomes, such taking coral fragments out of the water and 625 inoculating them with one mL (10 7 cells/mL) twice five days apart (Rosado et al. 2018). 626 Nonetheless, systematic experiments are required to determine optimal inoculation protocols, by 627 using the same bacterial taxa, coral species and culture conditions while varying bacterial cell 628 density and/or frequency of inoculum administration. 629 630 This experiment was conducted over a short timescale (four weeks), which did not allow the long-631 term stability of coral-bacterial associations to be evaluated. It is not clear whether the dosed 632 bacteria would be retained over time, especially when no further bacteria are delivered. Also, shifts 633 in the coral microbiome following transfer between field and aquaria settings have been reported 634 (Pratte et al. 2015; R\u00f6thig et al. 2017), which could challenge the implementation of microbiome 635 manipulation strategies if the goal is to achieve long-term changes in the coral-associated 636 microbiome. The coral microbiome is dynamic (Mouchka et al. 2010; Sweet and Bulling 2017), 637 especially in early life stages (Littman et al. 2009a; Zhou et al. 2017; Epstein et al. 2019a). As 638 recruits develop and grow, the complex microbial communities associated with juveniles shift 639 towards less diverse adult microbiomes. Due to these natural processes, the impact of bacterial 640 inoculations during early life stages might diminish over time, but this needs to be tested. In 641 addition to life stage, numerous other biotic and abiotic factors may influence the coral microbiome, 642 such as abundance and changes in Symbiodiniaceae species, coral disease, and water parameters of 643 salinity, temperature, pH and nutrient levels (reviewed in (Hernandez-Agreda et al. 2016b)).

                "text": "Overview of the experimental design. (A) Larvae from A. tenuis and P. daedalea were 1078 independently settled on plugs pre-conditioned with a microbial biofilm and CCA and subsequently 1079 sterilized. Six days post-settlement, recruits were counted and randomized across twelve 60 L tanks 1080 containing flow-through FSW. (B) On each inoculation day, bacterial pure cultures grown on MA 1081from the frozen stocks were suspended in FSW and adjusted to similar densities in order to prepare 1082 a fresh bacterial cocktail. Recruits from each 60 L tank were placed in containers filled with 1 L of 1083 static FSW. The bacterial cocktail was added to six containers using a serological pipette to inject 1084 10 mL of the suspension into the water directly above the recruits. The bacterial density in the 1085 inoculated containers was estimated at 10 5 -10 6 cells/mL. Recruits from the control treatments were 1086 handled in the same manner, except that FSW was added to the containers instead of the bacterial 1087 cocktail. After 6 h in static water, recruits were transferred back into the 60 L flow-through tanks.1088Two days following the last inoculation, all recruits were counted, sampled from the 60 L tanks1089 together with 1 L of surrounding water and snap-frozen for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene 1090 metabarcoding. Symbols for diagrams were modified from the Integration and Application Network 1091 Survival of control and inoculated A. tenuis and P. daedalea recruits at the end of the 1094 experiment (42 days post-spawning, after seven inoculations) as compared to the start of the 1095 experiment (16 days post-spawning, before any inoculation). (B) Representative pictures of A. 1096 tenuis (top) and P. daedalea recruits (bottom) at four weeks post-settlement. Black scale bar is 1 Boxplots representing richness based on Chao and Shannon \u03b1-diversity indices in coral 1100 recruits at the end of the experiment. Different letters denote groups with significantly different 1101 richness or Shannon \u03b1-diversity index (p < 0.05). Within each graph, groups with the same letter do 1102 not have a statistically significant difference in \u03b1-diversity. 1103 PCoA visualization using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measurement separating samples 1105 by treatment and host species.

The asterisks next to the bacterial names indicate that this ASV had a significantly 1111 different LFC in abundance between control and inoculated recruits. Coral samples were collected 1112 at the end of the experiment (day 42) following the seven bacterial inoculations. Red refers to A. 1113 tenuis while blue refers to P. daedalea.

Each dot represents one ASV (including ASVs 4, 6, and 7 from the inocula), 1126 here identified at the genus level when possible. Positive values represent ASVs proportionally 1127 more abundant in P. daedalea, while negative values are ASVs proportionally more abundant in A. 1128 tenuis."

                "text": "The most direct approach to reveal the molecular mechanisms of resistance and adaptation to thermal stress involves the analysis of proteome composition. In symbiont-bearing organisms the stress response involves two compartments (host and symbiont) and appropriate methods are needed to disentangle the specific proteome responses 12 . Due to high sensitivity and high throughput at relatively low costs, \"omics\" approaches have advanced quickly, providing promising new insights in the molecular mechanisms of stress responses in symbiont-bearing marine organisms [13] [14] [15] . Whilst proteomics provides powerful tools to understand how stress affects the biology of organisms, there are limitations to its application. Mass spectrometry based proteomics is strongly dependent on the coverage of sequence databases, which can be especially challenging in environmental research and limits its applications to well-studied model organisms. This bottleneck can be circumvented by performing cross-species homology searching by hybrid de novo peptide sequencing and database search approaches 16, 17 . Furthermore, previous studies have focused on non-symbiotic diatoms [18] [19] [20] or only the host proteomes 15, 21 , while invertebrate and algae proteomes are rarely analysed simultaneously. This is possible by performing proteomics analysis of holobionts and annotating the peptides/proteins in silico to either host or symbionts 14, 22 . By targeting photosymbiotic organisms as a functional unit, including the host and the endosymbiotic algae, key interactions between both compartments can be detected.",

The circum-global genus Amphistegina, which inhabits oligotrophic coral reef environments, hosts diatom photosymbionts 25 and is a vital constituent of coral reef ecosystems 26 . Due to their physiological sensitivity 27 to environmental changes they are commonly used as bioindicators for past and present coral reef health 23, 28, 29 and provide a useful model to study the effects of environmental change on photosymbiotic calcifiers. Their algal symbionts enable these calcium carbonate producers to generate approximately 3.9-5.4% of reef carbonate sediments . Both chronic thermal stress and high light intensities can induce bleaching in LBF, which is usually accompanied by a multitude of other afflictions and can ultimately diminish populations and reduce carbonate accumulation 9, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

In this study, a total of 1,618 proteins belonging to the concatenated host-symbiont database were identified by homology-driven search approaches, all of which were present in samples of all treatments and at the beginning of the experiment. In order to condensate these protein sequences -stemming from closely related organisms -a similarity-based clustering step was performed, which condensed 1,618 protein sequences to 1,136 protein clusters (Supplementary Table S3 ). The largest cluster comprised 10 protein sequences (all related to various actin isoforms), while 926 proteins remained as single-protein clusters. Out of all protein clusters, approximately 31% were assigned to the host foraminifera and 68% to the symbiont compartment. The proportion of the proteins assigned to each compartment should reflect the ratio of symbiont to host biomass. This has never been determined for foraminifera, but considering the observed symbiont density, the ratio is likely to be about balanced. A confounding factor, however, is the coverage of the protein database. This is much poorer in foraminifera, so the expected sign of effect would be to underestimate the amount of foraminifera proteins. Since the ratio we observe is 1:2 in favour of the symbionts, the database coverage effect is likely occurring, but it does not seem to be large (order of magnitude). Nine protein clusters contained sequences stemming from both host and symbionts and could not be clearly associated to a compartment, likely because the respective protein sequences are highly conserved. These ambiguous clusters have been removed from further analyses. Protein clusters will be simply referred to as proteins in the following sections.",

In contrast to the temporary-stress treatments, LBF exposed to chronic stress underwent distinct changes, indicating that the nature of the proteome response to thermal stress is depending on the persistence of stress exposure. The analysis illustrates that those proteins assigned to the host compartment are mostly distributed in direction of the chronic-stress treatment ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The foraminifers' reaction hence plays a more prominent role in continuous stress exposure, while proteomic changes in response to temporary-stress treatments took place dominantly in the symbiont compartment.",

It is possible that physiological changes in the foraminifera occur prior to reproduction. This could account for the observed drift in the proteome composition of the control. However, we are reluctant to attribute the observed drift in the control population solely to this effect. This is because we do not know how long the foraminifera require for acclimation to culture conditions and that the observed drift could reflect on-going acclimation. Notwithstanding the exact mechanism, the observed drift does not introduce a random effect into our test design, because it shifted the composition of the proteomes between the start and end in all replicates equally (Table S3 ).

The three-day stress peak at the beginning of the experiment thus had very little influence on the holobiont proteome in the long-term. Both compartments showed more pronounced responses in reaction to episodic stress events. In the symbiont compartment, the increased DAPs belonged to protein folding and degrading categories that are typically increased in response to stress in order to maintain homeostasis. Depleted DAPs incorporated some proteins participating in photosynthesis and other carbohydrate metabolizing processes, indicating a slight reduction of carbon concentrating mechanisms. Overall, a minor stress response was detected, but no lethal impacts on the diatoms derived from the episodic stress events. Interestingly, some processes in the host seemed to be slightly stimulated by the thermal fluctuations. Although actin, serine peptidase, and serine palmitoyltransferase were depleted, suggesting that the cytoplasm might have been damaged, the actin-related protein 2 was increased along with few metabolic and biosynthesis-related proteins. Since this protein mediates actin nucleation, new cytoskeletal filaments were likely created and/or actin-cytoskeleton based processes like cell locomotion, phagocytosis or intracellular motility of vesicles were enhanced 41 . These results are at odds with the proteomic responses of corals that show down-regulation of Hsps as well as proteins involved in translation and metabolic processes when exposed to quarter-daily temperature fluctuations 14 . Yet our previous observations reflect the proteomic outcome as holobiont motility and growth rates were also highest in this treatment 9 . Whether the foraminifers activity was enhanced as a general stress reaction, for repair or acclimatization, or if thermal variations act positively on the holobionts performance could not be determined here.

Heat stress in algae usually leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a malfunctioning of the photosystems, generating oxidative stress that may severely damage the cells 6 . Our detection of significantly elevated DAPs that are usually responsible for protein quality control, folding and degradation (e.g., Hsps, calreticulin, prohibitin) affirm that protein and cell damage occurred. Predominantly, members of the Hsp70 family were elevated, corresponding to the temperature-induced increase in Hsp gene expression in diatoms described previously . The production of these chaperones, which directly mediate correct folding and bind to partially denatured proteins to prevent their aggregation, is usually stimulated by proteotoxic stress, but also the synthesis of new proteins requires chaperones for assistance in folding . Here, we also detected a remarkable up-regulation of proteins responsible for cell death and degradation such as the hypersensitive-induced response and an autophagy-related protein (Atg8) 45 , indicating programmed cell death. Hypersensitive response is a mechanism that in plants is usually observed as a final stage in reaction to pathogens that leads to the rapid death of infected cells, possibly triggered by the presence of ROS . Atg8 is an ubiquitin-like protein that is essential for the formation of autophagosomes, which sequester bulk cell materials to be degraded and deliver them to the vacuoles, but it is also thought to play a key role in selective autophagy . Moreover, calreticulin/calnexin, which binds to defective or incorrectly folded proteins and thereby targets them for degradation, and at least one member of the Clp proteases family that often act in selective proteolysis were elevated. Similarly, the impairment of the photosynthetic electron transport and respiratory chains in iron deprived diatoms results in excess ROS accumulation, likely inducing redox-sensitive mechanisms that regulate metabolic rates in order to ensure cellular homeostasis 18 or triggering programmed cell death .",

This suggests that the amount of oxygen radicals might have surpassed the available ROS scavengers and could thus have damaged lipids, proteins and DNA . Interestingly, we found a severe reduction of HopJ type III effector proteins (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity-dependent outer protein), which usually play key roles in the host-pathogen interactions in the type III secretion system of pathogenic bacteria . These pathogens cause diverse diseases in hosts, based on their ability to colonize the intercellular spaces of plant tissues and cause death. As effector proteins usually help pathogen to invade host tissue and suppress its immune system, analogous functioning proteins might be crucial to keep the symbiosis in LBF intact, i.e. to protect the diatoms inside the host cell from being destroyed. Considering possible interactions that might cause the observed degradation of endosymbionts during bleaching in LBF, such mediators should be studied in more depth. Overall, the strong expression of chaperones and degradation-related proteins shows that exposure to heat did not only induce repair mechanisms, but also cell death and protein degradation in the photosymbionts. As we observed severe bleaching of our heat stress specimens 9 , this is in line with prior studies 9, 18, 32 and shows that prolonged thermal stress considerably harms the performance and induces deterioration of diatom symbiont cells (Fig. 4a ).",

Additionally, the mode of CO concentration and the posttranslational regulation of photosynthetic products are highly complex and remain largely unknown among diatoms . In our study, the symbiont-associated DAPs that decreased strongest comprised a variety of chloroplastic proteins and enzymes involved in photosynthesis and the coupled carbon-fixating metabolism (e.g. RuBisCO, fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c). Carbohydrate metabolic processes, specifically the production of polysaccharides via photosynthesis and the Calvin cycle, seemed to be severely impaired by the damaging effects of chronic heat exposure. Consequently, also DAPs participating in conversion of the resulting carbohydrates into storage compounds or their utilization via glycolysis or parallel metabolic pathways 50 appeared to be diminished. These pathways represent major sources of cellular energy (mostly stored and transported in the form of ATP) and provide the precursors that are necessary for the synthesis of many essential biomolecules such as lipids. The deficiency of CO 2 concentrating mechanisms was hence similarly detectable by the severe reduction of chloroplastic ATPases and other proton transporters.",

In the planktonic diatom Pseudonitzschia multiseries, elevated temperature leads to enhanced intracellular protein transport and turnover 19 . Other studies determined optimal temperature for the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to be around 25 \u00b0C, with growth and photosynthetic performance clearly dropping at higher temperatures 42 . Likewise, elevated temperatures have been shown to lead to decreased photosynthetic efficiency in other LBF 32, 37 and might even induce photoinhibition .

As days to weeks of exposure to sub-lethal heat can severely decrease photosynthetic efficiency 32, 37 , our results support the hypothesis that the heat-induced reduction in RuBisCO may diminish carbon fixation 38 seen through reduced calcification and holobiont growth 9, 32, 35, 36 . The observed depletion of photopigment concentrations and clearly decreasing but still on-going holobiont oxygen production measured within the same experiment 9 further support these findings and highlight the severe consequences of thermal stress on proteins responsible for the generation of carbohydrates and cellular energy.

The increase of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which initiates and catalyses the rate-limiting step in the conversion of lipids to acetyl-CoA, showed an enhanced lipid catabolism. Besides, we found small GTPases, GTP-and ATP-binding proteins to have highly increased in abundance. These are involved in signal transduction, ion transport (e.g. Ca 2+ -ATPase), but also play roles as sources of energy or activators of substrates in metabolic reactions and are used for protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Augmented degradation of lipids and carbohydrates through glycolysis and the TCA cycle leads to elevated production of amino acids and other important biomolecules. As also cell cycle-related proteins increased, biosynthetic processes and cellular reorganization might have been supported, which likely required enhanced signal transmission, compound and energy supply. In diatoms grown under suboptimal condition of nutrient or iron limitation, alike shifts from proteins related to photosynthetic carbon fixation to proteins involved in cellular respiration 20 and ribosomal translation 19 were observed. Jointly, the observed symbiont-associated DAPs in our study suggest that the stress response and degradation processes of the symbionts came along with the reduction of their CO 2 -concentrating mechanisms, leading to a reduction of energy storage and reorganization of other cellular constituents, possibly by recycling the remaining compounds through alternative metabolic pathways .",

Specifically the 26S proteasome is responsive to oxidative stress and was equally enhanced in anemones under heat stress 21 . This seems to be at odds with the observation that another serine peptidase (S10) was depleted, which specifically cleaves small peptides instead of full-length proteins 46 .

Similar to the symbiont compartment, an increase of cellular respiration was observed, specifically among enzymes catabolizing glycolysis (and gluconeogenesis), which represents a highly conserved response to cellular stress. Previous studies 33 on the ultrastructure of A. gibbosa describe significant declines of lipid bodies along with reduced numbers of viable symbionts during LBF bleaching.

Phototaxic studies have shown that LBF seek shade through reticulopodial locomotion when exposed to high light intensities 27 , which might also be caused by high temperatures. Furthermore, it was recently shown that actin-mediated relocation of symbionts in LBF plays a key role in photoprotective mechanisms 54 , moving symbionts away from the high light causing photic stress. Another reason might be that, as suggested for corals 55 , the importance of heterotrophic feeding in order to meet nutritional demands was increased during bleaching, requiring high cytoskeletal activity to collect and transport food particles into the endoplasm. Since specimens exposed to chronic stress showed severe bleaching, lowered chlorophyll a concentrations, and cessation of movement at the end of the experiment , we conclude that microtubule-activity was enhanced for intensification of intracellular transport, potentially enabling enhanced suspension feeding, transport of (damaged) proteins or symbionts targeted for degradation, or the reallocation of stored energy.",

                "text": "We confirm the physiological experiment in that the strongest response is seen in chronic stress, whereas fluctuating water temperatures slightly impacted the photosymbionts, resulting in elevated activity in the host. The molecular mechanisms underlying the strong chronic-stress response involve degradation of defective compounds and repair of cellular damage, which is likely caused by ROS (Fig. 4) . The thermal stress severely obstructed the functioning of the symbiotic diatoms, as observed in the detected photopigment loss and extensive bleaching. Increases in cell death and repair-related proteins indicate the disruption of proteostasis, and at the same time carbon concentrating mechanisms and transport of their products diminished. Foraminifera-associated proteins responsible for microtubule-based movement were strongly increased, along with molecular chaperones and holobiont total antioxidant capacities 9 . Thus, remaining resources were likely distributed from cell migration and growth towards stress response and the cellular reorganizations of the host. During the constant heat exposure of 30 days, these protective mechanisms, e.g. unfolded protein response and rapid protein turnover, apparently facilitated the LBFs survival. Key to this relatively high stress resistance could be the high nutritional flexibility of foraminifera, feeding on the photosynthate of their endosymbionts, storing energy in lipid droplets and the possibility to additionally feed heterotrophically, and should therefore be studied in more detail. Furthermore, bleaching in LBF has often been reported in combination with other impacts or diseases (such as reproductive dysfunction, infestations and malformations) 28, 31 . These likely represent secondary effects or long-term consequences of resource redistribution. Such potential trade-offs deserve further investigation by targeted proteomic studies.",

For regulated proteins, i.e. proteins with a p-ANOVA \u2264 0.05, Tukeys' HSD post hoc test was performed to determine the statistical significance for every individual condition compared to the control. Regulated protein clusters with a Tukeys' HSP post hoc test p-value \u2264 0.05 and a log 2 fold change (FC) greater than 1 or below -1 were considered as significantly changed in abundance. Hierarchical cluster analysis, using Euclidean distance matrices, were computed and plotted as heatmaps for proteins and treatments by the functions dist and hclust in R , and dendrograms were generated based on Ward's minimum variance method.",

All sequences were concatenated and searched against all eukaryotes in the non-redundant (nr) public NCBI database using blastp and a maximum E-value of 1.0 \u00d7 10 -5 reporting only the three top Blast hits. This was followed by the mapping function to assign gene ontology (GO) terms to each sequence with Blast hits. The GO term annotations were evaluated by the Blast2GO annotation rule algorithm using the following criteria: E-value filter 1.0 \u00d7 10 -6 , annotation cutoff 55 and GO weight 5. To complement the functional information of the proteins, an InterPro scan of these sequences was performed and GO information was merged. The resulting best Blast hits were adopted as sequence descriptions. If no specific protein names could be identified by the Blast search, available InterPro protein names were included. Based on the major molecular functions, biological processes and cellular component annotations, the proteins were grouped into different functional categories. These are not exclusive, but rather generic as many proteins can fulfil a multitude of functions and therefore might also fit into different categories. The entire annotation results can be found in the electronically available Supplementary Table S4 .",

(A) Malfunctioning photosystems in the diatom chloroplasts produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage cellular compounds. Molecular chaperones (purple) such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 stabilize and repair defective proteins (red) or target them for degradation by the proteasome. Cell death-related proteins (rose) such as hypersensitive response (HR) and autophagy-related protein 8 (Atg8) disassemble cellular components. (B) The damaged photosystems produce less cellular energy and photosynthate. To compensate for this and meet metabolic requirements, alternative resources e.g. stored in form of lipids are catabolized by the mitochondria. (C) Cellular constituents are partly reorganized through enhanced ion transport and cellular signalling 'G' proteins in combination with augmented biosynthesis of proteins (blue), possibly recycling the degraded compounds. In the host (b), the ROS lead to damaged or incorrectly folded proteins (D), but cellular homeostasis is maintained by chaperonemodulated repair mechanisms and targeted protein degradation. (E) Cell cycle-related functions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ribosomes and the Golgi such as protein synthesis and modification combined with increase in proteins responsible for transport and signal conduction facilitates enhanced protein turnover. (F) Energy resources stored in lipid bodies are metabolized, e.g. through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, to meet the augmented metabolic needs necessary for these stress response mechanisms, despite diminished supply of photosynthate by the impaired symbionts. (G) The cytoskeleton is damaged by the ROS-induced stress (red ends), but increased amounts of chaperonins such as Hsp60 assist in folding and stabilization of new cytoskeletal proteins.

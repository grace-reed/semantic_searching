    "abstract": "Abundant in nature, carotenoids are a class of fat-soluble pigments with a polyene tetraterpenoid structure. They possess antioxidant properties and their consumption leads to certain health benefits in humans. Carotenoid cleavage oxygenases (CCOs) are a superfamily of enzymes which oxidatively cleave carotenoids and they are present in all kingdoms of life. Complexity of CCO evolution is high. For example, in this study we serendipitously found a new family of eukaryotic CCOs, the apocarotenoid oxygenase-like (ACOL) family. This family has several members in animal genomes and lacks the animal-specific amino acid motif PDPCK. This motif is likely to be associated with palmitoylation of some animal CCOs. We recently demonstrated that two mammalian members of the carotenoid oxygenase family retinal pigment epithelial-specific 65 kDa protein (RPE65) and beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2) are palmitoylated proteins. Here we used the acyl-resin-assisted capture (acyl-RAC) method to demonstrate protein palmitoylation and immunochemistry to localize mouse BCO2 (mBCO2) in COS7 cell line in the absence and presence of its substrate \u03b2-carotene. We demonstrate that mBCO2 palmitoylation depends on the evolutionarily conserved motif PDPCK and that metazoan family members lacking the motif (Lancelet beta-carotene oxygenase-like protein (BCOL) and Acropora ACOL) are not palmitoylated. Additionally, we observed that the palmitoylation status of mBCO2 and its membrane association depend on the presence of its substrate \u03b2-carotene. Based on our results we conclude that most metazoan carotenoid oxygenases retain the evolutionarily conserved palmitoylation PDPCK motif to target proteins to internal membranes depending on substrate status. Exceptions are in the secreted BCOL subfamily and the strictly cytosolic ancient ACOL subfamily of carotenoid oxygenases.",

                "text": "Carotenoids are a class of naturally occurring pigments with antioxidant properties [1] [2] [3] . \u03b2-Carotene and certain other carotenoids such as \u03b2-cryptoxanthin have provitamin A activity, and the hydroxylated carotenoid xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin have been shown to protect the retina of the eye against oxidative stress [4] . Additionally, carotenoids can be oxidatively cleaved by various carotenoid cleavage oxygenases (CCOs) to generate various regulatory molecules such as hormones in plants (abscisic acid by 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) subfamily [5, 6] or carlactone (carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases 7 and 8 (CCD7, CCD8) [7] ), vitamin A (mammalian beta-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1) [8] and insect carotenoid isomerooxygenase (NinaB) [9, 10] ) or retinoid X receptor (RXR)-regulating apocarotenoids (mammalian BCO2) [11] . Carotenoid oxygenases are present in all kingdoms of life and have only been rarely lost in animal genomes [12] . They contain the same basic structural fold of a seven-bladed \u03b2-propeller and iron cofactor coordinated by four conserved histidines and three second shell glutamic acid residues [13] [14] [15] [16] . Mutation of any of the conserved histidines leads to total loss of activity for several mammalian carotenoid oxygenases [17, 18] . Carotenoid oxygenases act on hydrophobic substrates and their interaction with membrane and availability of substrate from membrane or lipid droplets is not completely known. Most metazoan carotenoid oxygenases contain the conserved PDPCK motif [12, 19] . RPE65 retinoid isomerase is an enzyme which plays a crucial role in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal (visual chromophore of rhodopsin) in the visual cycle of the retina [18, 20, 21] . It is a divergent and atypical CCO in that it neither uses carotenoids as a substrate, nor is it an oxygenase. The C112 cysteine residue located in the PDPCK motif of RPE65 protein is S-palmitoylated and palmitoylation at C112 is responsible for membrane interaction of RPE65. Mutation of C112 to any other residue leads to a complete loss of RPE65 activity [13, 22, 23] . In addition, the palmitoylation level of RPE65 is modulated by the presence of active lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), the obligate enzyme that produces RPE65 s all-trans-retinyl ester substrate, suggesting that palmitoylation also plays a functional or catalytic role [23] . Because of the conserved nature of the PDPCK motif in the animal BCO/RPE65 clades of the carotenoid oxygenase superfamily, we postulated that the presence of this motif in any protein belonging to the family would predict palmitoylation of the protein. Recently, we confirmed our hypothesis by demonstrating that mouse BCO2 is also a palmitoylated protein [19] . In this paper, we demonstrate that PDPCK is a palmitoylation motif of BCO2 and that, similar to RPE65, BCO2 palmitoylation depends on the presence of substrate. Our immunofluorescence results confirm the mitochondrial localization of BCO2 protein as shown earlier [24] . In addition to this, we further monitor the changes in subcellular localization upon treatment with substrate [24, 25] . Significantly, we also show that mutation of the cysteine residue (C111) in the PDPCK motif of BCO2 protein abolishes palmitoylation of BCO2. Previously, phylogenetic analysis of BCO/RPE65 family has demonstrated the presence of a BCO-like (BCOL) subfamily, where the PDPCK motif is absent. Now, also, we have characterized a new subfamily of ACOL proteins that are unlikely to be due to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and where the PDPCK motif is also absent. Finally, we have characterized the palmitoylation status of the BCOLg and ACOLa proteins.",

Then cells were treated with either \u03b2-carotene in 0.01% n-Octyl-\u03b2-d-thioglucopyranoside (OTG) or 0.01% OTG vehicle control for 5 h. Additionally, we treated cells with 2.5 \u00b5M all-trans-retinol in ethanol, as the presence of all-trans-retinol in assays modulated RPE65 palmitoylation in our previous experiments [23] . We used the acyl-RAC method as shown in Figure 1a : In brief, following treatment of protein with the thiol-blocking agent S-methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) to block free cysteine sulfhydryl (-SH) groups, hydroxylamine (HAM) was used to remove labile thioester-linked palmitoyl moieties in palmitoylated proteins, giving rise to free cysteine residues. These proteins with free cysteine residues were then captured and isolated using thiopropyl sepharose 6b (TPS6b) resin. Both membrane and cystosolic fractions of BCO2 were subjected to treatment with hydroxylamine (+HAM) and equal portions of the fractions were treated with NaCl (\u2212HAM) which served as control. In the absence of \u03b2-carotene, BCO2 protein showed an intense protein band in the HAM-treated sample (Figure 1b,c; untreated panel), while there was no protein band in the control NaCl-treated sample, indicating S-palmitoylation of BCO2 protein.",

Thus, our results demonstrate that mBCO2 is palmitoylated in the absence of \u03b2-carotene and that it loses palmitoylation when \u03b2-carotene is present (Figure 1b,c) . RPE65 retinoid isomerase uses all-trans-retinyl esters as substrate and not carotenoids. To provide RPE65 with substrate we add all-trans-retinol to cells, relying on intracellular esterification [23] . We added the RPE65 pro-substrate all-trans-retinol to the mBCO2-expressing cells as a control condition to further determine if mBCO2 palmitoylation status depends specifically on the presence of its \u03b2-carotene substrate. We found that addition of all-trans-retinol did not affect the palmitoylation status of mBCO2 (Supplementary Figure S1 ). The majority of mBCO2 protein is present in the 20,000\u00d7 g membrane pellet and only the membrane fraction of mBCO2 shows palmitoylation (Figures 1 and 2 ).

Because the 12,000\u00d7 g pellet contains not only mitochondria but also peroxisomes and lysosomes, we therefore examined BCO2 localization by immunofluorescence microscopy using mouse BCO2 transfected COS7 cells with various organellar markers (for mitochondria, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi). Immunofluorescence results as shown in Figure 5a ,b revealed the extensive mitochondrial colocalization with COXIV or heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60). We did not observe any colocalization of BCO2 with other organelles (Figure 5a ,b) as indicated by the very low correlation coefficient score compared with mitochondria. Our data are in full agreement with previous results for human BCO2 [24] . We also performed immunofluorescence analyses on mBCO2-transfected COS7 cells treated with 0.2 \u00b5M \u03b2-carotene for 5 h. In addition to mitochondrial localization, we observed a spatial difference in the localization of BCO2 in cytoplasm and nucleus upon treatment with \u03b2-carotene compared to untreated BCO2 (Supplementary Figure S3 ). However, subcellular fractionation studies failed to detect an increased level of BCO2 protein localized in cytoplasm (Figure 4a ).",

We found ACOL members in several cnidarian species and two putative orthologs in fungal species. Phylogenetic analysis of these ACOL proteins suggests that they form a well-supported clade (bootstrap support value = 99%) ( Figure 6 ). All ACOL proteins contain the four canonical conserved histidines required for iron coordination in the active center but do not have the PDPCK motif.

The putative amoebozoan ortholog is unlikely to be a bacterial contamination because of the presence of multiple introns. Thus, we conclude that the ACOL clade is an ancient eukaryotic protein family and the HGT hypothesis likely can be ruled out. We decided to check signs of functional changes in the course of the ACOL family evolution using a BLOSUM62-derived measure of amino acid differences (BDM, this BLOSUM62-derived measure is shown in the Supplementary Table S1 , see Methods for details). We analyzed a long branch leading to the ACOL family between nodes 374 and 375 ( Figure and Supplementary Figure S4 ). We used branches 374-368, 373-374 and 375-376 as neighboring branches. BDM1 = 1656, R1 = 126; BDM2 = 1483, R2 = 112. The Fisher's P value is equal to 0.55. Therefore BDM1 and BDM2 values are not different for the studied branches. This suggests that functional changes of ACOL compared to apocarotenoid oxygenases (ACO) are unlikely although results of the test should be treated with a caution (see the \"Methods\" section). Still, a plausible explanation is that the function of ACOL is likely to be the same or similar to cyanobacterial homologs consistent with lack of activity towards a full length carotenoids [28] . for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a WAG (Whelan-and-Goldman) model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value.

The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site.

This is in addition to the BCOL family we previously identified in animal genomes [12] . It is very tempting to speculate that these ACOL genes are the result of a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event from cyanobacteria to cnidarian species. However the existence of fungal orthologs of ACOL would appear to rule out a recent HGT event: divergence of the fungal and animal clades is an ancient evolutionary event (>900 million years ago) shortly after the time of origin of eukaryotes themselves [29] . On the other hand, multiple separate HGT events could have occurred in the fungal species, in the sponges, and in the cnidarians harboring ACOLs. It is of interest to note that Mortierella verticillata, a fungus harboring an ACOL ( Figure 6 ; along with a sister species M. elongata), has been shown to be a recipient of HGT [30] , while sponges and cnidarians, and other early diverging metazoans, have been the subject of much interest in this area [31, 32] . Two proteins from this subfamily were previously described in sponges (Suberites domuncula) and were found to have no \u03b2-carotene or lycopene cleavage activity in carotenoid producing E. coli [28] .",

We suggested that this apparent transferability of palmitoyl/acyl moieties between RPE65 and LRAT may play an important role in the efficiency of the vertebrate visual cycle [23] . We show here that mouse BCO2 is palmitoylated in the absence of substrate and not palmitoylated in the presence of \u03b2-carotene. This substrate-or activity-dependent palmitoylation may parallel the situation seen for RPE65. However, we did not find significant evidence that palmitoylation played a role in the mitochondrial membrane localization and trafficking of BCO2 [24, 26] . There are various published reports suggesting versatile functions of protein palmitoylation besides subcellular localization. For example, palmitoylation has been shown to regulate protein stability, translocation to lipid rafts, trafficking, aggregation, and interaction with other proteins [33, 34] . Accordingly, we speculate that palmitoylation may be involved in the catalytic function of the BCO2 enzyme. We observed that the addition of \u03b2-carotene and loss of palmitoylation leads to a more diffused pattern in the cells with partial nuclear and cytosolic involvement. We demonstrate that the C111 residue in the PDPCK motif is crucial for BCO2 palmitoylation, which is in agreement with recent RPE65 palmitoylation data [13, 22, 23] . On the other hand, metazoan carotenoid oxygenases that lack the PDPCK motif (such as BCOLg [12] and ACOLa) are not palmitoylated. This may be related to the particular protein subcellular localization of the different groups of CCOs (cytosolic or secreted). In future experiments, we will construct a chimeric protein adding the PDPCK motif to BCOLg and/or ACOLa in order to better understand the role of the PDPCK motif in governing CCO palmitoylation.",

Subsequently, three volumes of ice-cold 100% acetone was added to the blocking protein mixture and incubated for 30 min at \u221220 \u2022 C, and then centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C to pellet the precipitated proteins.

A fraction of the resuspended pellet was saved as the input.

Briefly,~200 \u00b5g of sample was treated with 2 M HAM together with the beads (previously activated with water for 15 min, washed and equilibrated with buffer A) to a final concentration of 0.25 M HAM and 10% (w/v) beads. As a negative control, 2 M NaCl (final concentration = 0.25 M NaCl) in 0.05 M HEPES buffer was used instead of HAM. Samples were then incubated at room temperature for 2 h with constant end-over-end mixing. After 2 h, samples were briefly centrifuged at 3000\u00d7 g and the supernatants removed and retained as the \"unbound\" fraction. The remaining beads were washed three times with 1 mL buffer A. Subsequently, the proteins were eluted from the beads by incubating with 50 \u00b5L of Laemmli sample buffer (LSB:\u03b2-mercaptoethanol (BME):Buffer A, 0.9:0.1:3) for 15 min at room temperature and then min at 95 \u2022 C.

We used branches leading to RPE65 and BCOL families ( Figure 6 ) as control experiments [12, 27] . We also analyzed the long branch leading to the ACOL family ( Figure 6 ). 3) We counted the number of amino acid replacements (R1), we used sites where ancestral states were predicted with the probability > 0.5 to infer high-confidence ancestral states. We also estimated the difference for each amino acid replacement (using BDM values) and summed BDM values for all R1 (BDM1). 4) We estimated BDM and R variables for three or four neighboring branches (depending on the local tree topology) and sum results for those branches producing R2 and BDM2. We avoided terminal branches because all tested branches (leading to RPE65, BCOL, and ACOL protein families) were internal ones. 5) We compared BDM1, R1, BDM2 and R2 using the one-tail Fisher exact test that produced a probability value P. We did not use any bulk analysis of all branches thus we did not apply the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. However, obtained P values should be treated with caution anyway. We performed two control experiments using RPE65 and BCOL protein families ( Figure 6 )",

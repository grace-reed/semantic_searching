    "abstract": "Although benzophenone-3 (BP-3) has frequently been reported to play a role in endocrine disruption, there is insufficient data regarding the impact of BP-3 on the nervous system, including its possible adverse effects on the developing brain. Our study demonstrated that BP-3 caused neurotoxicity and activated apoptosis via an intrinsic pathway involving the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the activation of caspases-9 and-3 and kinases p38/MAPK and Gsk3\u03b2. These biochemical alterations were accompanied by ROS production, increased apoptotic body formation and impaired cell survival, and by an upregulation of the genes involved in apoptosis. The BP-3-induced effects were tissuespecific and age-dependent with the most pronounced effects observed in neocortical cells at 7 days in vitro. BP-3 changed the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of Er\u03b1, Er\u03b2, Gpr30, and Ppar\u03b3 in a time-dependent manner. At 3 h of exposure, BP-3 downregulated estrogen receptor mRNAs but upregulated Ppar\u03b3 mRNA. After prolonged exposures, BP-3 downregulated the receptor mRNAs except for Er\u03b2 mRNA that was upregulated. The BP-3-induced patterns of mRNA expression measured at 6 and 24 h of exposure reflected alterations in the protein levels of the receptors and paralleled their immunofluorescent labeling. Er\u03b1 and Ppar\u03b3 agonists diminished, but Er\u03b2 and Gpr30 agonists stimulated the BP-3-induced apoptotic and neurotoxic effects. Receptor antagonists caused the opposite effects, except for ICI 182,780. This is in line with a substantial reduction in the effects of BP-3 in cells with siRNA-silenced Er\u03b2/Gpr30 and the maintenance of BP-3 effects in Er\u03b1-and Ppar\u03b3 siRNAtransfected cells. We showed for the first time that BP-3affected mRNA and protein expression levels of Er\u03b1, Er\u03b2, Gpr30, and Ppar\u03b3, paralleled BP-3-induced apoptosis and neurotoxicity. Therefore, we suggest that BP-3-evoked apoptosis of neuronal cells is mediated via attenuation of Er\u03b1/ Ppar\u03b3 and stimulation of Er\u03b2/Gpr30 signaling.",

More than approximately 10,000 tons of UV filters are produced annually for the global market [1] . The variety of such compounds and the percentage of different filters added to industrial products are expanding with the increasing demand to prevent UV radiation-induced cell damage. Organic chemicals that absorb UVA (400-315 nm) or UVB (315-280 nm) radiation are added at concentrations of up to 10% to sunscreen products for skin protection. Due to public anxiety regarding skin damage caused by UV light, the use of UV screens is increasing, even though the benefit with respect to the prevention of melanoma remains controversial. In Europe, 28 chemical substances that function as UV filters are approved for use in industry, but the European Commission has reported many of them as hormonally active substances or endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Chemical filters are almost always used in the mixtures but none of them are used individually in cosmetic in acceptable concentrations and does not provide adequate protection. These compounds are approved as harmless when used in small doses, but it should be noted that daily use involves at least several different cosmetics.",

The industrial use of BP-3 has increased over the past decade [2] . BP-3 is utilized as a flavor ingredient; a fragrance enhancer; a perfume fixative, an additive for plastics, coatings, and adhesive formulations; an ultraviolet curing agent in sunglasses; and as an agent to prevent UV light from damaging scents and colors in perfumes and soaps. It can be added to plastic packaging as a UV blocker, which allows manufacturers to package their products in clear glass or plastic rather than in dark packaging. Additionally, BP-3 has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as an indirect food additive [3] . Population studies have demonstrated that it penetrates through the skin and is excreted in the urine. BP-3 was found in >95% of urine samples collected from the US general population and in 100% of an investigated group of Danish children at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 21,700 ng/ml [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In some cases, as much as 10% of the applied dermal dose was absorbed into systemic circulation [9] . BP-3 was found in 83% of blood samples from investigated adults [10] .",

Epidemiological studies have provided evidence of a strong correlation between BP-3 exposure and increased ratios of diagnosed endometriosis [11] . However, the most disturbing finding is the fact that breastfed babies are exposed to BP-3, as this UV filter was detected in human milk samples [12] . In addition to mother milk, other ways of exposures to BP-3 are possible. BP-3 was found to cross blood-brain barrier after being applied in gavages [13] . It has been demonstrated that bisphenol A (BPA), which chemical structure is very similar to BP-3, easily crosses the blood-placental barrier [14, 15] . Therefore, fetal brain could be exposed to a much higher concentration of BP-3 than the concentration that was detected in human milk fat by Schlumpf et al. [12] . The high concentrations of BP-3 that have been detected in mother's urine may reduce birth weight in girls and increase birth weight and head circumference in boys [6, 16] . It has been postulated that the BPconcentration in urine may reach 16.7 \u03bcg/l and it may reflect less than 1% of the concentration of BP-3 to which healthy volunteers were exposed [17, 18] . Furthermore, a strong association between maternal exposure to BP-3 and the onset of Hirschsprung's disease in offspring has been shown [19] . In addition to the above-mentioned studies, there is insufficient data on the impact of BP-3 on the nervous system, including its possible adverse effects on the developing brain. The only relevant report showed apoptotic and neurotoxic effects of BP-3 on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells [20] .",

EDCs have been postulated to exert their actions through nuclear hormone receptors, including estrogen receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), either by activating or by suppressing them. Although BP-3 has been recognized as a ligand for nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs), there is no data regarding its interactions with newly identified membrane ER, G proteincoupled receptor 30 (GPR30), and the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b3, which is known to interact with ERs. Identifying chemicals that display hormonal activity is now a major research focus because they could disrupt brain development and cause abnormalities observed during ontogeny or at the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.",

This includes the survival of neurons, the growth and plasticity of neurites, their synaptic connections and transmission, and motor skills and higher cognitive functions [25] . Experimental and epidemiologic studies have provided information that estrogens protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD) in postmenopausal women and positively affect the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and tardive dyskinesia [26] . The idea of a neuroprotective function of estrogen is supported by observations that females are less vulnerable to acute insults associated with cerebral ischemia, neurotrauma, and hypoxia and that estradiol or estrogen-like compounds protect against stroke [27, 28] . Surprisingly, EDCs interference with nuclear receptors implicated in metabolism has remained scarcely studied. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate genes important in cell differentiation and various metabolic processes, especially lipid and glucose homeostasis [29] . These receptors are important for neuronal development and brain function. Agonists of PPAR\u03b3 have been used to reduce neurodegenerative changes in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases [30] and have also shown benefits in experimental models of stroke and ischemia [31] . Concomitantly, studies of PPAR\u03b3 activation showed effects against oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in several cell models that resemble AD, Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and spinal cord injuries (SCI) [32] . A signal cross-talk between nuclear ERs and the PPAR\u03b3 has also been shown [33] . However, there is no data on the interactions of BP-3 with these receptors in mammalian neurons.",

We also demonstrated an involvement of the retinoid X receptor (Rxr), which is an obligatory heterodimer partner of Ppar\u03b3, in the neurotoxic and apoptotic actions of nonylphenol and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) [35, 36] . The present study aimed to investigate the neurotoxic and apoptotic effects of BP-3 and the impact of this chemical on the expression and functions of ERs, including classical Er\u03b1/Er\u03b2, the membrane Gpr30 and Ppar\u03b3. Neurotoxicity was estimated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, which was complemented by an assessment of caspase-3 and -8 activities and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS production. These data were supported by Hoechst 33342/calcein acetoxymethyl (AM) staining, which allowed for apoptotic nuclei and cell survival to be visualized, respectively, and by measurements of the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, as detected by a microarray analysis. Specific inhibitors of caspase-8, caspase-9, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (Gsk3\u03b2), and p38/MAPK were employed to indicate which of these enzymes participated in BP-3-induced caspase-3dependent apoptosis. The involvement of classical and membrane ERs and Ppar\u03b3 in BP-3 actions was verified using selective antagonists and agonists. The levels of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and proteins were measured with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blot, and ELISA, and the cellular distributions of receptors were demonstrated using a confocal microscope.",

We demonstrated that BP-3 evoked concentration-dependent activation of caspase-3 and LDH release in neocortical and hippocampal tissues. In the paradigms examined in the present study, neocortical tissue responded to 25-100 \u03bcM BP-3, whereas hippocampal cells exhibited weaker vulnerability. The extended vulnerability of neocortical cells to BP-3 could be due to low expression of ERs in this tissue which limits ERrelated neuroprotection [46] . Indeed, in comparison to the hippocampal cells [42] , in neocortical cells Er\u03b1 protein is present in much lower concentration as evidenced in the present study. Recently, it has been observed that BP-3 used in similar concentrations (0.1-100 \u03bcM) caused toxic effects in neuroblastoma cells [20] . The BP-3 concentrations used in our study are environmentally relevant because BP-3 has been found in human adipose tissue at concentrations up to nearly mg/kg, which is equal to approximately 22 \u03bcM [47] . In the cited article of Wang et al. [47] , provided data on accumulation of BP-3 in adipose tissue were related to the concentrations of the compound in males and females of Caucasian and African-American origins and expressed as mean values. However, the authors underlined approximately threefold lower levels of accumulated BP-3 in African-Americans both males and females. Therefore, the actual levels of accumulated BP-3 in Caucasians could be much higher than the values of 30.3 and 62.2 ng/g. BP-3 is able to cross blood-brain barrier since it has altered Er\u03b1 and Er\u03b2 mRNA expression levels in rat pituitary gland after being applied in gavages [13] . Moreover, BP-4 which is BP-3 analogue when added to water, displayed multiple effects on gene expression in the zebrafish brain [48] .",

The BP-3induced effects were age-dependent with the most pronounced enzyme activities observed at 7, but not at 2 and 12 DIV. Based on our results, BP-3 induced ROS formation, suggesting that ROS initiated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in neuronal cells. Indeed, we indicated that BP-3 caused a substantial loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibitors of intrinsic-related caspase-9 and kinase Gsk3\u03b2 reduced the effects induced by BP-3. The cytotoxic effects of BP-3, which involved activation of caspase-3, LDH release, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and ROS formation, were previously observed in the HaCaT cell line [49] . Moreover, a reduction of ROS scavengers, i.e., GSH, in response to BP-3 The membrane ER antagonist G15 (10 \u03bcM) was added to the culture media simultaneously with BP-3. The cells were cultured on glass coverslips, washed with mM PBS, and exposed to Hoechst 33342 (0.6 \u03bcg/ml) at RT for 5 min. The cells were subsequently rewashed and incubated with 2 \u03bcM calcein AM at RT for 10 min. Cells with bright fragmented nuclei showing condensed chromatin were identified as undergoing apoptosis, whereas cells with light-colored cytoplasm were identified as living cells was observed in Tetrahymena thermophila [50] . In our study, the apoptotic effects of BP-3 were inhibited by an inhibitor of p38/MAPK but not by an inhibitor of extrinsic-related caspase-8, thus confirming the prevalence of an intrinsic pathway in BP-3-induced apoptosis in neural cells. Furthermore, BP-3 only partially engaged extrinsic-related caspase-8 in neuronal apoptosis when used in higher concentrations. We postulate that BP-3 by stimulating p38/MAPK may inhibit Er an d Ppar\u03b3 functions in neuronal cells.",

However, there is no data regarding the mechanisms of action of BP-3 in the mammalian nervous system that involve classical and newly recognized membrane estrogen receptors and Ppar\u03b3. Classical estrogen receptors (Er\u03b1, Er\u03b2) and Ppar\u03b3 are nuclear receptors acting as ligand-activated transcription factors. The estrogen receptors when located on the plasma membranes may rapidly activate intracellular pathways such as ERK 1/2 and PI3K kinases [51, 52] . As for Ppar\u03b3, there are no reports on membrane localization of the receptor. In the present study, BP-3 altered the mRNA expression levels of Er\u03b1, Er\u03b2, Gpr30, and Ppar\u03b3 in a time-dependent manner. We demonstrated that 3-24-h exposures caused decreases in Er\u03b1 and Gpr30 mRNAs. Moreover, 6-24-h exposures to BP-3 caused a significant increase in Er\u03b2 mRNA but decreased Ppar\u03b3 mRNA. Recently, BP-3 was found to have a direct impact on the ER-related insect endocrine pathway, activating the ecdysone receptor gene EcR [53] . BP-3 also transcriptionally activated human ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 in transfected human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 [54] . Furthermore, BP-3 was found to cause a strong activation of hER\u03b2 in reporter gene assays in HELN cells [55] , which is similar to the substantial upregulation of Er\u03b2 mRNA observed in our study. We showed that BP-3-induced patterns of mRNA expression detected at 6 and 24 h reflected alterations in the protein levels of the receptors, as indicated by the use of specific ELISAs and western blot analyses. These profiles were also in parallel with the immunofluorescent labeling of Er\u03b1, Er\u03b2, Gpr30, and Ppar\u03b3 in response to BP-3. Basing on these data, we hypothesize that the BP-3evoked apoptosis of neuronal cells is mediated via the attenuation of Er\u03b1/Gpr30/Ppar\u03b3 and the stimulation of Er\u03b2 signaling pathways, though we did not differentiate the effects between nuclear and membrane receptors.",

According to our data, Er\u03b1 and Ppar\u03b3 agonists diminished, as a percentage of the control, either in siRNA-transfected or nontransfected cells. Each bar represents the mean \u00b1 SEM of three to four independent experiments. The number of replicates in each experiment ranged from 5 to 8. ***p < 0.001 versus the non-transfected control cultures, $ p < 0.05, $$$ p < 0.001 versus the siRNA-transfected control cultures but Er\u03b2 and Gpr30 agonists stimulated the BP-3-induced apoptotic and neurotoxic effects. In comparison to receptor agonists, receptor antagonists caused opposite effects, except for ICI 182,780, which is known to act not only as an Er\u03b1/Er\u03b2 antagonist but also as a Gpr30 agonist. These results were complemented by double Hoechst/calcein AM staining, according to which the receptor antagonists PHTPP and G15 improved viability and attenuated BP-3-induced apoptosis, whereas MPP and GW9662 did not change these parameters. This is in line with a substantial reduction of the effects of BPin the cells with siRNA-silenced Er\u03b2/Gpr30 and the maintenance of the effects of BP-3 in Er\u03b1-and Ppar\u03b3-siRNA- transfected cells. Therefore, we suggest that BP-3-evoked apoptosis of neuronal cells is mediated via an attenuation of Er\u03b1/ Ppar\u03b3 and stimulation of Er\u03b2/Gpr30 signaling. Recently, it has been shown that activation of Ppar\u03b3 inhibited caspase-3 activity and protected murine cortical neurons against ischemia [56, 57] . Reduced expression of Ppar\u03b3 accompanied neurotoxicity of TBBPA [58] which is in line with the effect of BP-3 in our study. We hypothesize that the BP-3-evoked downregulation of Ppar\u03b3 is at least partially due to the upregulation of Er\u03b2. A negative cross-talk between Er\u03b2 and Ppar\u03b3 has previously been shown in adipose tissue of \u03b2ERKO mice [59] . It is also possible that the reduced expression of Er\u03b1 observed in our study was linked to the cross-talk of Ppar\u03b3 with its heterodimeric partner, the nuclear receptor Rxr\u03b1, through the mechanism previously detected in the vitellogenin A2 promoter [60] . We demonstrated that the BP-3-affected mRNA and protein expression levels of Er\u03b1, Er\u03b2, and Ppar\u03b3 measured by qPCR, ELISAs, western blot, and immunofluorescent labeling of neuronal cells are parallel to BP-3induced apoptosis and neurotoxicity. Although BP-3 reduced Gpr30 mRNA and protein expression, it accelerated the function of Gpr30 in neuronal cells, thus pointing to the involvement of Gpr30 in BP-3 neurotoxicity.",

We showed for the first time that BP-3-evoked apoptosis of neuronal cells is mediated via the attenuation of Er\u03b1/ Ppar\u03b3 and the stimulation of Er\u03b2/Gpr30 signaling, as demonstrated using selective ligands and specific siRNAs and by measurements of mRNA and protein expression (qPCR, ELISA, western blot, immunofluorescent labeling) of the receptors.

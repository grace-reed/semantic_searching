    "abstract": "The bacterial and temperature factors leading to yellow blotch/band disease (YBD), which affects the major reef-building Caribbean corals Montastrea spp., have been investigated. Groups of bacteria isolated from affected corals and inoculated onto healthy corals caused disease signs similar to those of YBD. The 16S rRNA genes from these bacteria were sequenced and found to correspond to four Vibrio spp. Elevating the water temperature notably increased the rate of spread of YBD on inoculated corals and induced greater coral mortality. YBD-infected corals held at elevated water temperatures had 50% lower zooxanthella densities, 80% lower division rates, and a 75% decrease in chlorophyll a and c 2 pigments compared with controls. Histological sections indicated that the algal pyrenoid was fragmented into separate segments, along with a reconfiguration and swelling of the zooxanthellae, as well as vacuolization. YBD does not appear to produce the same physiological response formerly observed in corals undergoing temperature-related bleaching. Evidence indicates that YBD affects primarily the symbiotic algae rather than coral tissue.",

However, microbial pathogens are being increasingly identified with coral diseases, as in black band disease (51) . Microbial pathogens affecting corals include the fungi Aspergillus sydowii (47, 60) and Aurantimonas coralicida, which affect sea fans and other gorgonians and caused white plague type II in the Florida Keys in 1995 (12) . At least 18 species of corals were reported to be susceptible to this disease, including massive branching and plating species. The bacterium Serratia marcescens was reported to be the pathogenic agent causing white-pox disease (48, 50) . This disease reduced populations of a significant coastal reef-building coral, Acropora palmata. S. marcescens is a common human intestinal bacterium and is found in sewage and contaminated soils. Human sewage has been linked to the disease, marking the first time a gut bacterium has been found to harm a marine invertebrate (48) . Bacteria associated with black band disease of corals also included common human gut microbiota, but these were not found in healthy coral tissue (18) .",

Corals exposed to 31\u00b0C showed an 80% mortality rate, and the 20% that survived had YB lesions covering the entire surface (host tissue remained alive). When the four Vibrio spp. were inoculated together, the YBD signs developed more rapidly and closely matched the disease progression and cell impairment features found in field samples of YBD (8) . This suggests that these four species may act as a consortium. Field specimens of corals with YBD remain alive for years, depending upon the stress conditions placed upon the coral. As the lesion advances, the tissue remains alive, albeit without its symbionts. Over time, if stress conditions remain and the lesion advances quickly, the tissue starts to die and the skeleton is exposed. The symbionts are either degenerate, vacuolated, or absent. YBD has an appearance similar to that of thermal coral bleaching and can sometimes be confused with it. It is important to take careful photographs and analyze samples using microbiological probes to confirm the differences between YBD and thermal bleaching. While Koch's postulates have ostensibly been fulfilled for each of the four Vibrio sp. isolates tested during this study, the postulates lack the flexibility to be applied directly to disease symptoms that may be induced by more than one bacterium. The poorly understood and complex nature of the microbial community associated with the coral makes it very difficult to ascertain the stress conditions needed to initiate the disease. The isolates may be acting as destabilizing agents within the microbial community, allowing some normally innocuous member of the coral-associated microbial community to opportunistically cause infection. It is also possible that each of the isolates directly induces the disease symptoms, either by some common pathogenic mechanism or by disparate means. Variations in the proportions of different bacteria in the consortium could affect the color, width, and seasonal progress rate of the lesions. These questions merit further research, as the answers could determine whether YBD continues to be treated as a single disease or as a collection of symptoms common to several diseases.",

Redistribution and degeneration of algal organelles accompanied by vacuolization, fragmentation, swelling, and displacement of cytological features are evident (Fig. 6 ). These symbiotic zooxanthellae are broken down during bacterially induced stress, hindering normal growth of the coral. We further clarified the characteristics of this breakdown due to the decrease in cell density and mitotic indices of YBD-exposed corals. The measurement of zooxanthella loss as a bioassay for assessing stress in coral has been used before (39, 46, 63, 68) (Fig. 7) . Future research focusing on longer exposure times of the pathogenic bacteria and its mechanism of action are needed.",

We provide new evidence that indicates that YBD is a symbiont infection that results in in situ zooxanthella degradation rather than expulsion from host tissue on Montastraea spp,. as in thermal bleaching. When Chl a and c 2 pigment concentrations decrease due to stress, photosynthesis becomes impaired, decreasing energy and slowing growth (15, 40, 66) . It has been found that under thermalbleaching conditions, Montastrea spp. and other corals have lower zooxanthella chlorophyll a and c 2 concentrations than normal pigmented colonies (14, 40, 42) . Any future research should make use of various molecular techniques, such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, which could provide further insight into the dynamics of the total microbial community during the disease process. Further experiments using fluorescence in situ hybridization probes of the four bacterial species, exposing the symbiotic algae to YBD-associated Vibrio spp., and comparing the results to normal thermal bleaching would be interesting.",

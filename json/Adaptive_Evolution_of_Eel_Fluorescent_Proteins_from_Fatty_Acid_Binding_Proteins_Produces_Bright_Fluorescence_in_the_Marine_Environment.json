Using transcriptomic analysis of two species of brightly fluorescent Kaupichthys eels (Kaupichthys hyoproroides and Kaupichthys n. sp.), two new FPs were identified, cloned and characterized (Chlopsid FP I and Chlopsid FP II). We then performed phylogenetic analysis on 210 FABPs, spanning 16 vertebrate orders, and including 163 vertebrate taxa. We show that the fluorescent FPs diverged as a protein family and are the sister group to brain FABPs. Our results indicate that the evolution of this family involved at least three gene duplication events. We show that fluorescent FABPs possess a unique, conserved tripeptide Gly-Pro-Pro sequence motif, which is not found in non-fluorescent fatty acid binding proteins. This motif arose from a duplication event of the FABP brain isoforms and was under strong purifying selection, leading to the classification of this new FP family. Residues adjacent to the motif are under strong positive selection, suggesting a further refinement of the eel protein's fluorescent properties. We present a phylogenetic reconstruction of this emerging FP family and describe additional fluorescent FABP members from groups of distantly related eels. The elucidation of this class of fish FPs with diverse properties provides new templates for the development of protein-based fluorescent tools.

                "text": "The photic marine environment is proving to be a crucible of evolution for novel biofluorescent molecules. With increasing depth in the ocean, the intensity of sunlight decreases in an approximately exponential manner and the spectral quality of light also changes, becoming increasingly restricted to a narrow range of wavelengths of blue light (470-490nm) [1] . This was first qualitatively described by Beebe [2] whose firsthand account conveys how the red, orange, yellow, and green components of sunlight disappeared during his bathysphere descent into the mesopelagic zone, leaving a predominately blue environment. Marine organisms biofluoresce by absorbing the dominant blue light, and reemitting it at a longer, lower energy wavelength, visually resulting in green, orange, and red fluorescence. Following the seminal discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a hydrozoan jellyfish in 1962 [3] , fluorescent proteins (FPs) have been found in numerous anthozoans, primarily scleractinian corals [4, 5] , copepods [6] , amphioxus [7, 8] , ctenophores [9] and most recently, fishes [10, 11] .",

The finding that biofluorescence is phylogenetically widespread and phenotypically variable in marine fishes [17] highlights many interesting new questions as to the role of biofluorescence in groups with advanced visual capability. Many fishes have been shown to possess yellow intraocular (lenses or cornea) filters [18] , which could potentially function as long-pass filters and could enable enhanced perception of biofluorescence.",

Its fluorescence matched the intensity of adjacent brightly fluorescent corals. This discovery led to a series of expeditions to the Caribbean and South Pacific where several species of biofluorescent eels, representing several anguilliform families, were collected and analyzed [17] .

Here we identify, clone and characterize two new members of this FP family and demonstrate that fluorescent FABPs have a unique tri-peptide sequence motif (Gly-Pro-Pro) inserted in a loop between two \u03b2 sheets, which is not found in other non-fluorescent FABPs. Chlopsid FP I and Chlopsid FP II exhibit blue shifted emission spectra when compared to UnaG. We show using analysis of dN/dS skew (MEME option in Datamonkey) [19] that this sequence motif arose from a duplication event of the FABP brain isoforms and was under strong purifying selection during the evolution of the family leading to this new florescent protein family. In addition, residues adjacent to the motif are shown to be under strong positive selection, which we suggest is a further refinement of the fluorescent properties of the proteins in eels. Here we expand on the identification, biochemical characterization, and phylogentic grouping of this new family of fluorescent eel proteins as first identified by Kumagai et al. [11] . ",

Fluorescent macro images [4928 x 3264 (Nikon D7000); 2180 x 1800 pixel (Nikon D300S)] were produced in a dark room by covering the flash (Nikon SB 600 and SB 800) with band-pass (BP) excitation filters (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) and attaching long-pass (LP) (Semrock, Rochester, NY) filters to the front of the camera lens. Two different excitation/ emission filter pairs were tested on each sample to stimulate the strongest fluorescence emission: excitation 450-500 nm, emission 514 LP; excitation 500-550 nm, emission 555 and 561 LP. All images were obtained within two hours of collection and the sample was immediately frozen in a liquid nitrogen dry shipper for transport.

These terminals were obtained using a BLAST search with human FABP7 with an e-value cutoff of e-25. Once we determined that there were two FABP isomers in the majority of the vertebrate taxa with hits at e-25 (one heart isomer and one liver), we then searched the database further for the two paralogs for all of the taxa. This final search resulted in a matrix of 210 terminals over 163 vertebrate species (See S1 Table for accession numbers and abbreviations used in the matrix and phylogenetic trees). The DNA sequences were aligned using TranslatorX [28] , which provides both DNA and amino acid sequence alignments that agree at all codons. The DNA sequences were translated into amino acid sequences and these two data sets were formatted into Nexus (for use in PAUP) [29] and Phylip formats (for use in RaxML Blackbox). The aligned sequences are provided in S2 Table. Maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) trees were generated using RaxML blackbox [30] and PAUP. Bootstrap trees for the two methods were also generated. We used Modeltest [31] to determine the best model for the DNA sequence matrix and ProTest [32] for the amino acid sequence matrix. The GAMMA+P-Invar model was used for DNA sequence ML analysis. The WAG with GAMMA+P-Invar model was used for ML analysis of proteins. Bayesian analysis (BY) use 1,000,000 generations with the GAMMA+P-Invar model with default priors (convergence of chains was obtained with this number of generations). In all, ten trees were generated and compared for congruence, where the data source [DNA or Protein] is listed first followed by a slash, then the phylogenetic criterion [MP, ML or BY] listed second followed by a slash, and finally the robustness criterion used [bootstrap or single best tree]). Analysis of dN/dS ratios. For dN/dS skew detection at the residue level we used the MEME option in Datamonkey (http://www.datamonkey.org/) and for examining dN/dS skew on branches of the phylogeny (BREL) for these proteins we used HYPHY (http://hyphy.org/w/ index.php/Main_Page). The MEME option can use either a NJ tree or a user supplied tree. Hence we used the MEME option with two input trees-the NJ tree and the ML tree obtained by phylogenetic analysis of the data. A model of sequence evolution is also required for MEME and so we used the default model as supplied in Datamonkey and the optimal model as derived from the \"automatic model selection tool\" option in Datamonkey. The optimal model from Datamonkey automatic model selection tool was 012032. This approach required four separate MEME runs that resulted in from six to eight sites under positive Darwinian selection depending on the parameters of the analysis (raw results presented in S3 Table) . The dN/dS branch analysis (BREL) was accomplished with the HYPHY program using the ML tree as an input tree and computing statistics only for internal branches. We also used the PRIME option in Datamonkey to characterize the potential change in properties of the residues that experience positive dN/dS skew. PRIME is a variation of MEME that detects residue changes that can be categorized as changes in the original property of the amino acid. There are five categorical changes that can be detected using prime-polarity index, secondary structure factor, volume, refractivity/heat capacity and charge/iso-electric point [33] .",

They purified a fluorescent protein from A. japonica muscle tissue and isolated and sequenced several peptide fragments. Some of the peptides isolated were found to be homologous to previously published fish fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs). Based on these results, we performed a crude purification of the fluorescent bands from the electrophoresis of eel muscle protein extract and subjected it to mass spectroscopy. We identified the full-length sequences of these proteins in the Kaupichthys transcriptome data and synthesized two genes exhibiting the highest homology to the proteins identified by Hayashi and Toda [10] . However, expression of these proteins did not produce visible fluorescence in either E. coli or mammalian cells. Then in 2013, Kumagai et al., published a full characterization of the fluorescent protein from A. japonica [11] . The protein, termed UnaG, is a novel member of the FABP family, and the fluorophore was found to be a bound bilirubin molecule. Unlike the non-fluorescent FAP sequences we had synthesized from Kaupichthys, we noticed that UnaG had an insertion of the tri-peptide Gly-Pro-Pro. We then re-examined the Kaupichthys hyoproroides and Kaupichthys n. sp. data and found a single transcript in each of the two species' transcriptomes that encoded an FABP including the Gly-Pro-Pro insertion. We synthesized the proteins containing this motif and both showed strong green fluorescence in mammalian cells and E. coli upon addition of exogenous bilirubin. These proteins, termed Chlopsid FP I and Chlopsid FP II, are orthologs of UnaG (Fig 5) and have ex/em spectra of 489nm/523nm (Fig 6) .",

Alternatively it is possible that a single duplication gave rise to the two major kinds of FABPs and independent duplications in specific fish lineages led to the eel FPs and the Fish Liver-like FABPs. While there is some variation as to the placement of the eel FPs in relation to the liver and brain FABPs depending on the analysis parameters and optimality criteria, the DNA ML analysis and the Bayesian and MP trees place the Eel FPs either sister to or within the brain FABPs.

The number of sites under positive dN/dS skew range from eight (for the NJ tree with the best model) to six (for both of the ML tree analysis regardless of model). We will discuss the more conservative results for the ML tree here, but it should be noted that there is broad overlap in the inferences made regardless of tree or model of sequence evolution. The Gly-Pro-Pro motif shows strong purifying selection as it is a conserved motif (dN = 0; dN/dS = 0) in all organisms where it is found. Fig 8 maps the location of the inserted Gly-Pro-Pro residues in residue positions 59, and 61 of the eel FPs. The two amino acids preceding the conserved Gly-Pro-Pro insertion sites in FPs (residue positions 57 and 58) appear to be under strong positive selection. This pattern might suggest that these sites are actively affected by natural selection as a result of the Gly-Pro-Pro insertion in this FP. In addition, there are four sites under positive selection in the carboxy terminus of the protein. When we examine the six sites we observe to have positively skewed dN/dS ratios for altered protein properties we find that the two residues that are adjacent to the Gly-Pro-Pro motif that show dN/dS skew are changing in their refractivity and heat capacity. The other four residues toward the carboxy terminus that show dN/dS skew are changing in their polarity index, their secondary structure factor and in their volume as well as isoelectric point and Refractivity/Heat Capacity.",

Previous work with UnaG showed that mutation of asparagine-57 to an alanine preceding the GPP motif causes quenching of fluorescence [11] . In Chlopsid FP I and Chlopsid FP II this amino acid is a histidine. This difference in amino acid sequence can potentially explain the fluorescence shift, due to an increase in the \u03c0 conjugation of the system. This change in fluorescence emission spectra demonstrates that it is possible to make changes to the amino acids around the conjugated bilirubin, which can alter the fluorescence spectrum of the protein.",

We sought to determine how unique the Gly-Pro-Pro sequence is amongst the enormous number of FABPs that have been identified across the animal kingdom. The UnaG, Chlopsid FP I and Chlopsid FP II were used as bait for other vertebrate FABPs. FABP DNA and protein sequences were used for analysis (S1 Table) . Phylogenetic trees were generated and we found that eel FPs from the families Anguillidae and Chlopsidae are either sister to the FABP7 brain clade, which diverged from primitive fishes, or nested within it. Although we found non-fluorescent FABPs in Kaupichthys and in the transcriptome of Anguilla, these FABPs do not contain the Gly-Pro-Pro tri-peptide motif. Fluorescent proteins from Anguilla and Kaupichthys arose from a gene duplication event in these fishes, probably in the common ancestor of the two species. The patterns we observed (Fig 7; S1, S2 and S3 Figs) indicate that the larger gene family involved at least three duplication events. Two of these duplications coincide with the 1R and 2R duplications in the common ancestor of vertebrates. The third probably occurred in the common ancestor of eels, and allowed for the neofunctionalization of the duplicated FABP protein into a FP. To examine if the neofunctionalization of the FPs involved sequence specific changes and dN/dS skew, and potentially natural selection, we examined which branches are evolving under different dN/dS skews. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig 8. Two nodes showed statistically significant difference in skew. The node leading to the brain FABP7 in mammals and birds appears to have a dN/dS ratio of > 2.0. The branch leading to the FPs (both Kaupichthys and Anguilla FPs) has a dN/dS skew >14, indicating strong sequence change in the common ancestor of these eel FPs, such as has been reported for opsins [38] [39] . The fluorescent eel proteins are, therefore, members of a novel family of FABP7 proteins.",

The Gly-Pro-Pro motif was positively selected for during the evolution of FABPs, leading to the evolution of this new fluorescent protein family. It is interesting to note that this result was inferred using different trees, and while not identical, they are overall very similar. Fig 8 maps the location of the inserted Gly-Pro-Pro residues in the middle of the eel FPs. There is also significant change in amino acid function very near to the insertion sites in the FPs. While the skewed sites and changed function sites do not directly coincide with the inserts it is interesting to note that regions adjacent to these do exhibit significant patterns. These results suggest that several cluster sites in the protein are showing significant dN/dS ratio. Of these clusters two are adjacent to residues that are responsible for the fluorescent property of these proteins.",

FABPs are small (~16 kDa), structurally conserved cytosolic proteins consisting of a interior binding pocket filled with water, surrounded by ten anti-parallel beta sheets forming a beta barrel [42] . At the surface of the beta barrel, two alpha helices cap the pocket and are thought to be involved in regulating ligand binding [43] . In most vertebrates, there are two major kinds of vertebrate FABPs, those found in the brain and those found in the heart. For the fluorescent FABPs, there is a key Gly-Pro-Pro motif that is essential for fluorescence and is present in all fluorescent FABPs (Fig 8) . This family of fluorescent eel FABPs is considerably smaller (~16 kDa) than GFP (26.9 kDa), requires bilirubin for fluorescence, and is oxygen independent.",

                "text": "The order Anguilliformes, the true eels, comprises about 800 species that have traditionally been classified in three major suborders and 111 genera. While Anguilla is known to undergo vast migrations (thousands of kilometers) between growth habitats in freshwater and spawning habitats in tropical and subtropical open ocean areas [44] , the poorly studied chlopsid eels are not reported to do so. Therefore, the hypothesis that fluorescence acts as a muscle tissue antioxidant mechanism in Anguilla, via the non-covalent binding of bilirubin [11] , may not hold for Kaupichthys. In Chlopsidae there is a possibility that fluorescence serves a visual function. During full moon spawning events, the moonlight could potentially stimulate fluorescence and increase species contrast against the blue background of the ocean for these cryptically patterned, and otherwise reclusive fishes. Little visual or reproductive data are available for Kaupichthys, however, calculations suggest that these eels exhibit a lunar cycle of reproduction and that they synchronously spawn during or shortly after full moon periods [45] . It is reported for some Anguilla species that as they transition during metamorphosis between an adult freshwater yellow eel and the sexually maturing oceanic silver eel, their visual system changes its spectral sensitivity. The middle-wavelength-sensitive cones shifts from~550 nm to~525 nm [46] . Fluorescence in coral has been suggested as a means to increase visual contrast in the monochromatic marine environment. [5] [47] [48] [49] Fluorescence appears to play a role in certain visually guided behaviors in reef fishes [50] . In addition, marine fish fluorescence is especially common and morphologically variable in cryptically patterned lineages [17] , providing additional support for the hypothesis that fluorescence serves a visual function for marine organisms. Sexually dimorphic fluorescence patterning has also been observed in some species of marine fishes [17] .",

For example, unlike all other known vertebrates, the blood plasma of A. japonica is blue-green [51] due a high stable concentration of biliverdin [52] . Once produced, biliverdin is further metabolized into bilirubin. However, altered heme metabolite dynamics are not always associated with the emergence of fluoresncece. For example, lamprey exhibit life cycle dependent bilirubinemia and do not exhibit visible fluorescence, nor do they appear to have a Gly-Pro-Pro containing FABP.",

This current report of the evolutionary consideration of fluorescent fatty acid binding proteins from marine eels that can be autonomously expressed in mammalian cells will expand the toolbox of fluorescent probes available for use in experimental biology. As with GFPs, we find that variations in the primary amino acid sequence of this class of FPs alters the protein's spectral properties. This finding opens the door to mutagenesis investigations that could produce spectral and structural variants (i.e. circular permutants) in which the fluorescence output can be dynamically varied to produce fluorescent event sensors. These findings also raise questions about the behavioral ecology of the poorly known chlopsid eels and if biofluorescence plays a similar functional role (i.e. communication, predator avoidance, prey attraction) as bioluminescence.",

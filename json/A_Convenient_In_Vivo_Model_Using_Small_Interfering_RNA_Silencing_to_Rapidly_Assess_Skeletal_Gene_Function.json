    "abstract": "It is difficult to study bone in vitro because it contains various cell types that engage in crosstalk. Bone biologically links various organs, and it has thus become increasingly evident that skeletal physiology must be studied in an integrative manner in an intact animal. We developed a model using local intraosseous small interfering RNA (siRNA) injection to rapidly assess the effects of a target gene on the local skeletal environment. In this model, 160-g male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 1-2 weeks. The left tibia received intraosseous injection of a parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (Pth1r) or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf-1r) siRNA transfection complex loaded in poloxamer 407 hydrogel, and the right tibia received the same volume of control siRNA. All the tibias received an intraosseous injection of recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1-34) (rhPTH (1-34)) or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Calcein green and alizarin red were injected 6 and 2 days before euthanasia, respectively. IGF-1R and PTH1R expression levels were detected via RT-PCR assays and immunohistochemistry. Bone mineral density (BMD), microstructure, mineral apposition rates (MARs), and strength were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, micro-CT, histology and biomechanical tests. The RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry results revealed that IGF-1R and PTH1R expression levels were dramatically diminished in the siRNA-treated left tibias compared to the right tibias (both p<0.05). Using poloxamer 407 hydrogel as a controlled-release system prolonged the silencing effect of a single dose of siRNA; the mRNA expression levels of IGF-1R were lower at two weeks than at one week (p<0.01). The BMD, bone microstructure parameters, MAR and bone strength were significantly decreased in the left tibias compared to the right tibias (all p<0.05). This simple and convenient local intraosseous siRNA injection model achieved gene silencing with very small quantities of siRNA over a short treatment period (7 days).",

Bone can no longer be considered an isolated organ that is regulated independently of other homeostatic processes; on the contrary, bone represents an important metabolic organ that interfaces with adipose depots, skeletal muscle, pancreas, liver, testis, and the immune system through endocrine, paracrine and autocrine mechanisms [2, 3] . The skeleton is an example of how a whole-organism approach to physiology can broaden the understanding of how a given organ functions and reveal connections to other organs [4] . An increasing number of studies have found that bone can secrete many biologically active substances, such as bone morphogenetic proteins, growth factors, adipokines, inflammatory cytokines, cardiovascular bioactive peptides, etc [1, 5] . Through these bioactive substances, bone not only plays an important role in its own formation and remodeling [6, 7] but also critically modulates systemic function [8] .",

However, the drawbacks of transgenic animal models are obvious, such as the long time requirement, high cost, substantial technical difficulties and high risk [12] . Additionally, the physical size of a transgenic mouse is small, which makes it difficult to study bone fracture healing or bone defect repair. A conditional knockout or tissue-specific gene knockout may be more complicated, especially in such a complex organ as the bone, which contains various cells. RNA interference (RNAi) allows for the experimental inhibition of gene expression, and thus the knockdown of proteins of interest, in mammalian cells in culture and in animals [13, 14] . Harnessing RNAi will enable the exploration of the impact of a gene on pathophysiology, and this technique has great potential in the development of drugs designed to knock down the expression of any disease-causing gene, thereby greatly expanding the number of possible drug targets [15] .",

Compared with systemic delivery methods, the local delivery of siRNA/shRNA has many advantages, such as targeting specific tissues or organs, mimicking a conditional gene knockout effect, or enabling the development of certain disease models. The local delivery of siRNA is ideal for diseases in which the target sites are easily accessible.

For example, ribonucleases may limit the half-life of naked siRNA molecules in the circulation to less than 1 min [34] . The siRNA vectors (Entranster TM -in vivo) used in this study were commercial dendrimer nanoparticles containing many amino groups that protonate at physiological pH. The protonated amino groups can then neutralize the electric charge on the surface of the siRNA, allowing the siRNA molecules to be compacted into relatively smaller structures to prevent nuclease degradation. The nanometer-scale transfection reagent has unique characteristics, such as providing stronger siRNA protection and lower cytotoxicity [34] .

Poloxamer 407 is biocompatible and stable and displays low toxicity and weak immunogenicity, making it suitable as a vehicle for a controlled drug delivery system. Poloxamer also demonstrates reversible thermosensitive gelation (sol-gel characteristics), which is convenient for handling and provides ease of application [38] . In this proof-of-principle study, we used IGF-1 and rhPTH , two common bone anabolic agents that increase mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation and result in enhanced bone formation primarily through their cognate receptors, IGF-1R and PTH1R [16, 17] . In the current study, we developed a unique delivery approach by which siRNA and dendrimer nanoparticles could be delivered directly and locally to the target tissue. Our results suggested that we can obtain sufficient gene silencing with this simple and convenient method.",

Compared to one injection for one week, the silencing efficacy of one injection for two weeks was much better, possibly due to the use of poloxamer 407 hydrogel, which facilitated the sustained release of the siRNA transfection complex. Although the silencing efficacy of two injections over two weeks was significantly higher than that of one injection for two weeks, the skeletal biological properties, such as the BMD, microstructure and strength, did not change significantly. To obtain improved gene silencing results, an injection frequency of once per week may be better and may be adjusted according to the length of the study period.",

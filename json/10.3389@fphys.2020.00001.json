                "text": "Intertidal organisms face a fluctuating environment where the salinity can exhibit drastic changes during a single day (Geng et al., 2016) . These natural variations in salinity may be further accentuated by the changes occurring in oceans due to climate change, which is expected to modify water evaporation and precipitation patterns in the near future (Ipcc, 2014) . Many marine osmoconformers lack the capacity to regulate osmolarity and the ion content of their internal fluids, especially the extracellular fluids that are in equilibrium with their environment making them highly susceptible to salinity fluctuations. Marine calcifiers need Ca 2+ and CO 3 2\u2212 ions to build their shells. Part of the required CO 3 2\u2212 is produced metabolically and the Ca 2+ is taken up from the environment or from food (Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b) . Therefore changes in seawater salinity and thus ion concentrations is likely to affect the physiology of marine calcifying organisms. Salinity stress has been shown to trigger multiple physiological responses in marine calcifying invertebrates including changes in protein and mRNA expression, enzyme metabolism, cell signaling, amino acid content and ion regulation (Shumway, 1977a; Berger and Kharazova, 1997; Zhao et al., 2012; Meng et al., 2013) . A decrease in environmental water salinity was shown to decrease shell calcification and/or affect shell properties in species such as Crassostrea virginica and Mytilus edulis (Malone and Dodd, 1967; Dickinson et al., 2012; Sanders et al., 2018) and alter the expression and function of nacrein, a carbonic anhydrase enzyme with a key role in bivalve shell formation in Mytilus galloprovincialis (Cardoso et al., 2019) . Nonetheless, it remains unclear how environmental salinity, ion regulation mechanisms and calcification are interconnected.",

The tissue organization of the bivalve mantle is conserved. It is composed of an inner layer of muscles, nerve fibers and connective tissue covered on either side by epithelial cells (Marin et al., 2012) . The outer mantle epithelium (OME) is the shell-facing epithelial layer, which transports and secretes shell components.

Traditionally, the bivalve mantle is divided into three zones: the central, the pallial, and the mantle edge (K\u00e1d\u00e1r, 2008; Bj\u00e4rnmark et al., 2016) . The differences in morphology between the different mantle zones have also been suggested to reflect their functions, such as ion transporting abilities. The mantle edge, consisting of three separate folds, the inner, the middle, and the outer fold, is suggested to be especially active in calcification (K\u00e1d\u00e1r, 2008) . However, the pallial mantle zone has also been shown to actively transport Ca 2+ (Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al., 2018) . In addition to transporting Ca 2+ , cultured mantle cells have been observed to precipitate CaCO 3 intracellularly (Xiang et al., 2014) . The mantle is also the main organ responsible for secreting the organic matrix onto which CaCO 3 precipitates (Wheeler and Sikes, 1984; Wang et al., 2013) . The proteins making up the shell matrix control the location and timing of the biomineralization process as well as the shape and orientation of the minerals (Marin and Luquet, 2004; Takeuchi and Endo, 2006; Gardner et al., 2011) .",

Calcium is mostly taken up across the gills, mantle tissue and the gut as ionic calcium (Ca 2+ ) and is then transferred via the hemolymph to the EPS (Rousseau et al., 2003; Fan et al., 2007b; Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al., 2016) . Hemolymph ion concentrations of marine bivalves deviates only slightly from the environmental ion concentrations (Shumway, 1977a; Knowles et al., 2014; Thomsen et al., 2015; Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al., 2016) . Multiple pathways and mechanisms have been suggested for the transfer of calcium across the OME. The movement of ionic Ca 2+ across the OME may be passive or through Ca 2+ transporting membrane-proteins and channels (Ip et al., 2017; Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al., 2018) . Alternatively, Ca 2+ could be transferred bound to Ca-binding proteins through mantle epithelial cells (Nair and Robinson, 1998; Xue et al., 2012) . Specialized hemocytes or intracellular vesicles containing CaCO 3 crystals have also been proposed to participate in the transfer of calcium to the EPS (Mount et al., 2004; Cho and Jeong, 2011; Li et al., 2016) .",

PMCA and NCX seem to have almost equal importance in the transfer of Ca 2+ across the OME, and each contributes approximately 30% to the total transfer (Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al., 2018) . Genome sequencing of C. gigas, has revealed a variety of PMCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA) or L-type calcium channel transcripts (Zhang et al., 2012) whereas no genes annotated as NCX were found. Transcripts for PMCA, NCX, and/or Ca channels have also been identified in other bivalve species such as Pinctada fucata, M. edulis, and Tridacna squamosa (Fan et al., 2007b; Wang et al., 2008; Ip et al., 2017 , Ramesh et al., 2019 suggesting common transport systems are conserved across different species. Similarly, carbonate, either in the form of HCO 3 \u2212 or CO 3 2\u2212 , has been suggested to be transported through active transporters such as the Cl \u2212 /HCO 3 \u2212 exchanger to the shell growth area (Zhao et al., 2018a; Ramesh et al., 2019) .",

They were transferred to the aquaria facilities at the Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Sweden and acclimated to recirculating artificial seawater (Aquaforest, Poland) at 10 \u2022 C, for at least 1 week prior to the start of experiments. The oysters were randomly divided into eight identical 15 L plastic containers, 5 oysters/container, filled with 10 L of water from the recirculating system used for acclimation. Half of the containers were filled with seawater with a salinity of 28 (osmolality 805 \u00b1 16 mOsm \u2022 kg \u22121 and [Ca] 6.06 \u00b1 0.22 mM) and the other containers with seawater diluted to 50% with tap water to give a final salinity of 14 (osmolality \u00b1 11 mOsm \u2022 kg \u22121 and [Ca] 3.17 \u00b1 0.10 mM). The water was oxygenated using compressed air, which also maintained the water pH at 8.11 \u00b1 0.03 for the duration (14 days) of the experiment. The oysters were not fed during the experiment, and the water was exchanged every other day to avoid accumulation of metabolic waste and feces. After 14 days of exposure to full strength seawater (28) or 50% SW (14), 4 oysters from each experimental tank were sampled for Ussing chamber experiments and two pieces of the mantle were removed for quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis (Figure 1 , see sections \"In silico Analyses\" and \"qPCR Analysis\"). Because only eight samples can be simultaneously analyzed with the Ussing chamber set-up available, the start of the experiment and the sampling were executed on two consecutive days (16 oysters/day). Mortality during the experiment was 10% (salinity 28: 5%, 14: 15%).",

The mixing of the Ringer solution within the half chambers and the maintenance of constant oxygen and pH (7.33 \u00b1 0.03; Metrohm 744 pH meter, Switzerland) levels was achieved by constant bubbling with a gas-air mixture containing 0.3% CO 2 . The mantle tissues were allowed to stabilize for 60 min after which the Ringer solution was exchanged. 4 ml of fresh Ringer solution was added to the right half chamber (shell side of the OME), while 4 ml of Ringer solution containing 0.015 MBq radiolabelled 45 Ca (Specific activity 458.65 MBq/mg PerkinElmer, MA, United States) and 0.56 MBq 3 H labeled mannitol were applied to the left half chamber (the \"hemolymph\" side of the OME). Samples of 50 \u00b5l were immediately taken from both half chambers to assess the amount of 45 Ca at the starting point of the experiment. To assess the rate of 45 Ca transfer as well as the appearance rate of 3 H-mannitol (an inert hydrophilic molecule used to assess the paracellular permeability of the OME), 50 \u00b5l samples were taken from the \"shell\" side half chamber at 10, 15, 20, 60, 80, 85, and 90 min after changing the Ringer solution. Radioactivity of the samples was counted after addition of 4.5 ml of scintillation fluid Ultima Gold (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, United States) using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac 1409 Liquid Scintillation \u03b2-Counter, Turku, Finland) with a dual label protocol for 3 H and 45 Ca.

NXC (A0A0L8HMV4) from the Octopus bimaculoides was retrieved since it was not identified in the annotated genome of C. gigas. The sequences retrieved from the C. gigas genome as well as the O. bimaculoides NCX were used to search the assembled C. gigas genome available from Ensembl Metazoan Genomes 1 to identify additional family members. For comparative purposes and to study gene family evolution, homologs of the putative ion-transporter genes from C. gigas were procured in other mollusks (bivalves, gastropods and cephalopods) as well as in annelids and a brachiopod, the lamp shell (Lingula anatina). The BLAST algorithm from the Ensembl Metazoan Genomes and NCBI 2 databases (February 2018) was used to search for sequence homologs. Searches at NCBI were performed in the sub-dataset for bivalves (taxid:6544). Homologous sequences from the Mediterranean mussel (M. galloprovincialis) were obtained by searching available mantle transcriptomes (SRP063654) (Bj\u00e4rnmark et al., 2016) using the same strategy as outlined above. Genome data for a gastropod, the owl limpet (Lottia gigantea), a cephalopod, the California two-spot octopus (O. bimaculoides), for two annelids, a leech (Helobdella robusta) and a worm (Capitella teleta) and for a brachiopod, the lamp shell (L. anatina) were retrieved from Ensembl Metazoan Genomes. For comparative purposes homologs from two other protostomes, a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and a nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), from an invertebrate deuterostome, the ascidian (Ciona intestinalis) and from two vertebrates, the human (Homo sapiens) and a teleost, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) were also procured and retrieved from Ensembl 3 using sequence similarity searches or genome annotations. To better understand gene evolution, two cnidarians (basal metazoans) available from NCBI (see text footnote 2, cnidarians: taxid:6073) and JGI 4 databases were also searched for homologs of putative ion-transporter genes using the BLASTP algorithm. The identity of the retrieved sequences was confirmed by searching against the human protein sub-set database available from NCBI (taxid:9606).",

Partial sequences were retrieved from some species and were concatenated and aligned with the full-length homologs from related species. The final MSA dataset for each gene family was used for construction of phylogenetic trees using the ML and BI methods. ML trees were carried out using PhyML 3.0 (Guindon et al., 2010) in the ATGC bioinformatics platform with SMS automatic model selection (Lefort et al., 2017) based on AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) to best study protein evolution. ML trees were constructed using an LG substitution model (Le and Gascuel, 2008) for SERCA, PMCA, NCX, and NKA and a VT model (M\u00fcller and Vingron, 2000) for the L-type and T-type Ca channel. Reliability of internal branching in phylogenetic trees was assessed using 100 bootstrap replicates. The BI tree was performed in MrBayes 3.2 (Ronquist et al., 2012) using as appropriate an LG or VT substitution models (Aamodel = LG or Aamodel = VT) and 1,000,000 generations sampling probability values to support tree branching. ML and BI trees were displayed with FigTree 1.4.2 and edited in Inkscape.",

The mRNA expression of the ion transporters, NKA and SERCA decreased in the mantle of C. gigas exposed to lower salinity (14) while T-type VGCC and NCX expression increased. The changes in the expression of the ion transporters and channels affected by the decrease in the environmental salinity suggest that the OME cells aim to maintain a high enough intracellular Ca 2+ concentration for sufficient Ca 2+ flow for the shell formation area.

In general, marine invertebrates only have one or two NKA-\u03b1 isoforms, suggesting that the multiple vertebrate isoforms arose from a later gene duplication event (S\u00e1ez et al., 2009; Lind et al., 2013; Thabet et al., 2016) . In addition to its role as a house keeping ATPase in all cells, NKA participates in the osmoregulation of marine organisms. Reduction in environmental salinity has been shown to decrease the mantle NKA activity in multiple bivalve species such as Meretrix lusoria and M. galloprovincialis as well as in the abalone Haliotis discus hannai (Borgatti et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2016; Jia and Liu, 2018) . However, in some species hypoosmotic conditions did not affect the NKA mRNA expression in the mantle (Paganini et al., 2010) , gills (Lin et al., 2016) or whole body (Willmer, 1978; Peng et al., 2019 ) and in other cases increased it. Interestingly, when either up-or down-regulated, the need to maintain an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane is suggested to explain the observed changes in NKA expression. The NKA mRNA expression in the present study may be down-regulated as a direct consequence of lowered Na + concentration in the hemolymph, as this would decrease the passive gradient of both ions across the membrane and thus fewer NKA proteins would be needed to maintain the intracellular Na + concentrations. However, the effects seem to be dependent on species and/or tissue used for extraction, or the experimental set-up.",

                "text": "According to Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al. (2018) , Ca 2+ is suggested to enter OME cells through VGCCs. Multiple VGCC genes were found in the C. gigas genome, which were homologs of the human L-, P-, and T-type Ca channels. While the L-type and P-type VGCCs belong to the high voltage-activated channels, the T-type (transient) channels are characterized by their fast inactivation and low voltage threshold (Snutch et al., 2000 (Snutch et al., -2013 . All types have previously been identified in other mollusks although their exact function remains unknown (Kits and Mansvelder, 1996) . In the bivalve P. fucata, L-type channels are present in the gills and mantle fold epithelial cells suggesting they have a role in Ca 2+ uptake from the environment (Fan et al., 2007b) . This is further supported by observations that during larval shell development in M. edulis Ca channel expression and SERCA expression are up-regulated suggesting that they respond to an increased need for Ca 2+ for shell mineralization (Ramesh et al., 2019) . Changes in the expression of ion channels and transporters may also be related to the adaption to the new environmental salinity. When cells are exposed to hypo-osmotic medium, they swell due to the inflow of water through the cell membrane. To counteract this swelling and to return back to the original volume, cells need to excrete organic and/or inorganic osmolytes to gain equilibrium with the environmental osmolality (Pierce and Greenberg, 1973) . Ion extrusion has been suggested to be part of volume regulation and to precede the excretion of the organic osmolytes which make up the main part of the volume regulation in invertebrates (McCarty and O'Neil, 1992; Silva and Wright, 1994) . As observed in the present study VGCCs were up-regulated in C. gigas and C. virginica reared in low salinity, possibly due to their function in cell volume regulation (Meng et al., 2013; Eierman and Hare, 2014) .",

In P. fucata for example, three SERCA isoforms that share high sequence similarity (97-99%) and differ only at the C-terminus are alternatively spliced transcripts of a single gene (Fan et al., 2007a) . The P. fucata SERCA has a tissue specific expression pattern with one isoform being expressed predominantly in the mantle and gill tissues (Fan et al., 2007a) . Only a single SERCA isoform was expressed in the mantle of C. gigas and it was responsive to changes in environmental ion concentration suggesting it has an important role in Ca 2+ metabolism and possibly shell mineralization.",

In C. gigas, as in other bivalves, a single PMCA gene exists, which can generate multiple isoforms. PMCA is a high affinity, low capacity transporter in contrast to NCX, which is a low affinity high capacity transporter (Blaustein et al., 2002) . PMCA can respond rapidly to changes in intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations and thus finely regulate intracellular Ca 2+ levels. However, it may become saturated when high levels of Ca 2+ have to be transported to the EPS (Blaustein and Lederer, 1999) . This suggests that PMCA is probably important for the continuous transfer of Ca 2+ to the extrapallial fluid (EPF). In contrast, NCX, together with ER and other Ca storing compartments, may be important during periods of bulk transfer of Ca 2+ such as occur during shell biomineralisation, especially when the inflow or outflow of Ca 2+ are changed. The subcellular location of PMCA, and its likely function can be deduced from its amino acid sequence and the protein splice variants. An insertion larger than 30 amino acids at splice site A compared to the human PMCA 2 has been suggested to imply an apical location (Enyedi and Strehler, 2011) . The C. gigas PMCA found from the genome contained an insertion of 39 amino acids in the homolog region of splice site A of human PMCA, which implies it may have an apical location (Supplementary Figure S4 , Enyedi and Strehler, 2011; Zhang et al., 2012) . The 39 amino acid insertion in C. gigas PMCA is similar to that reported in T. squamosa (Asp285-Asn320), which has been shown by immunofluorescent microscopy to have an aplical location (Ip et al., 2017) . These findings support the model of Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al. (2018) where the functional studies indicated an apical localization of PMCA.",

Some invertebrates contain multiple genes with similarity to NCX, but only one gene product functions as a true Na + /Ca 2+exchanger i.e., a membrane protein executing the exchange of Ca 2+ for a Na + and driven by the electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane (On et al., 2008) . The other genes annotated as NCX share similar motifs to the functional NCX but lack some critical amino acid sequences for the Na + /Ca 2+ -exchanging function. Previously, the presence of a NCX in C. gigas could not be directly verified using inhibitors against the vertebrate NCX, but a decrease in the Ca 2+ transfer after inhibition of the NKA provided indirect evidence for the participation of NCX in the Ca 2+ transfer across the OME (Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al., 2018) . In this study, we show that the NCX is expressed in the mantle tissue of C. gigas and could thus potentially participate in the Ca 2+ transporting mechanisms necessary for shell calcification. NCX, together with PMCA are proposed to participate in calcification in larval M. edulis (Ramesh et al., 2019) and coral Acropora yongei (Barron et al., 2018) .",

                "text": "Taken together, the results from the electrophysiological and permeability measurements show that both active and passive ion transport across the OME decreases in C. gigas maintained in diluted seawater when compared to the salinity 28. However, the mRNA expression data indicates that the response of the individual transporters and channels is not uniform. Even though the mRNA expression of transporters was measured in the whole mantle tissue instead of solely the OME, the results suggest that when exposed to reduced salinity the oysters aim to maintain stable Ca 2+ metabolism despite the lower water and hemolymph ion concentration. The intracellular Ca 2+ concentration in the cells is physiologically well regulated and maintained at a constant level. Ca 2+ enters the mantle cells through VGCCs down its electrochemical gradient in a passive and concentration dependent manner. Therefore, if the extracellular Ca 2+ concentration varies, the cell Ca 2+ uptake, release and sequestration need to be adjusted accordingly. In the current study, the increase in mRNA expression of the T-type VGCCs in the salinity 14-group suggests that the mantle cells adjust to reduced extracellular Ca 2+ concentrations by up-regulating systems that promote Ca 2+ entry into cells. The decreased mRNA expression of SERCA in low salinity may reflect an additional compensatory mechanism, to maintain Ca 2+ levels in the cytosol through less sequestration of Ca 2+ into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). From the perspective of shell biomineralisation, an increase in the expression or activity of Ca 2+ transporters and channels in dilute seawater would contribute to maintain a stable Ca 2+ transfer rate to the shell building area. In other words, the oysters may compensate for decreased environmental Ca 2+ concentrations by decreasing Ca 2+ sequestration in the ER and keeping the amount of available Ca 2+ in the cytosol ready for transport to the EPF stable. As NCX often responds to changes in the cellular in/outflow of Ca, an increase in its expression might be coupled to changed intracellular Ca 2+ uptake and sequestration (Ottolia et al., 2013; Seth et al., 2013) . The functional relevance of the changes in VGCC and SERCA expression in the mantle of C. gigas maintained in a reduced salinity environment (14) may be associated with a shift in the intracellular Ca 2+ balance, which promotes increased extrusion of Ca 2+ from the mantle cells. However, it cannot be excluded that the upregulation of NCX in the oysters acclimatized to salinity 14 may be a results of a decreased Na + concentration in the hemolymph. Up-regulation of NCX in a low Na + environment would be a means by which to maintain the same rate of Na + /Ca 2+ exchange. To summarize, the decrease detected in the total transfer of Ca 2+ across the OME implies that the OME cells were not able to maintain a stable rate of Ca 2+ transfer across the cell membranes, despite an up-regulation of T-type VGCC and NCX.",

Prolonged salinity stress might lead to activation of the immune system, which also tends to increase cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations (Zhao et al., 2012) and might thus affect Ca 2+ sequestration and extrusion. Stress from exposure to suboptimal salinity might also suppress biomineralisation to save energy for other essential physiological processes. The significant suppression in total Ca 2+ transfer across the OME of C. gigas maintained in diluted seawater in the present study indicates that prolonged periods in low salinity have the potential to modify shell calcification and maintenance. Changes in the environmental salinity and ion concentration could also potentially affect the carbonate metabolism in calcifying organisms. The expression of a putative HCO 3",

(2018) by revealing that VGCCs, PMCA, and NCX are expressed and regulated in the mantle tissue of C. gigas and have a potential role in Ca 2+ transfer for biomineralisation. In addition, it was demonstrated that the exposure of C. gigas to reduced environmental salinity (14) decreased active ion transport and Ca 2+ transfer across the OME. The associated change in the mRNA expression of T-type VGCC, SERCA, and NCX in the mantle of C. gigas acclimated to salinity 14 suggests that they have the ability to adjust ion regulation when environmental conditions change but that the Ca 2+ available for shell growth is reduced. Taken together, the results indicate that the environmental fluctuations in costal water salinities, possibly emphasized as a consequence of climate change, may impact the ion transport by the mantle and thus shell calcification in C. gigas.

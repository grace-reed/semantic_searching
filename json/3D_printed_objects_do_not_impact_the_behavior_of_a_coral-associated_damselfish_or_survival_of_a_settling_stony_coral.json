As rates of degradation or chemical leaching of 3D printed models has not been well documented under environmental conditions, it is essential to examine if these objects will alter the behavior or impact the survivorship of the focal species prior to widespread implementation. Here, we explored the efficacy of using 3D printed models in coral reef behavioral research, an area of study where this form of additive manufacturing could offer significant advantages. Coral-associated blue-green chromis (Chromis viridis) individuals were exposed to natural and 3D printed coral habitats, and larval mustard hill coral (Porites astreoides) were offered 3D printed substrate as a settlement surface. Habitat association and behavioral analyses indicated that C. viridis did not discriminate or display modified behaviors between 3D printed and natural coral skeletons or between 3D printed materials. P. astreoides displayed significantly higher settlement when provided with 3D printed settlement surfaces than when provided with no settlement surface and settled at similar rates between 3D printed surfaces of differing materials. Additionally, growth and mortality of P. astreoides settled on different 3D printed surfaces did not significantly differ. Our results suggest that the 3D printed models used in this study are not inherently harmful to a coral reef fish or species of brooding coral, supporting further exploration of the benefits that these objects and others produced with additive manufacturing may offer as ecological research tools.",

During the printing process, models are digitally sliced into 2D layers, then built from the base upwards through the deposition of melted material [1] . Technological advances in 3D printing have made this process applicable and valuable in developing objects and tools across an array of fields. For instance, 3D printed implants [2] and prosthetics [3] are designed specific to individual medical needs, buildings are constructed using industrial-sized printers [4] , and 3D printed objects are used as tangible educational tools [5] .",

For instance, the interstitial space of a 3D printed oyster reef was quantitatively manipulated to understand the structural properties that mediate foraging success of the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) [10] . As individual oysters grow irregularly, the use of 3D printed shells allowed for consistency and repeatability of the experimental habitat.",

Activity level has been equated with a measure of a fish's boldness that can indicate the https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221157.g003 Table 1 . All 3D printed tile treatments were found to have significantly higher settlement compared to the control aquaria. likelihood of food acquisition, courting behavior, and encounter rates with predators [26] . Stimuli that affect patterns in activity levels of reef fishes could have significant interspecific and intraspecific impacts [27] . 3D printed corals were able to successfully replicate the target complex habitat without compromising C. viridis' activity patterns, suggesting the use of these models for similar research in situ is justifiable. The successful recruitment of reef-building corals is a crucial process for ensuring the longevity of coral reef ecosystems. Once recruited, post-settlement facets of survivability such as predation, habitat suitability, and water quality affect the viability and growth rate of the coral https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0221157.g004 spat [28] . Thus, it is important to understand how the survivorship of coral spat may be affected if they settle on 3D printed materials intended for use as settlement sites on natural reefs. Under controlled conditions, P. astreoides chose to settle significantly more in aquaria containing 3D printed tiles compared to control aquaria with no tiles. This result suggests the 3D printed tiles were successfully designed to provide a textured surface that recruiting corals have shown to prefer [29] . While it was not in the scope of the current study to broadly compare settlement rates on 3D printed tiles to more traditional settlement surfaces, this assessment would be valuable for exploring potential alternatives to conventional methodologies. Settlement time for most treatments was comparable to settlement rates observed on more commonly used materials. In a similar experimental design, the settlement rate of P. astreoides on limestone tiles, pre-conditioned in situ, was 12.5% (\u00b1 4.95) after a one-week settlement period [30] . After one week in the current study, all treatments had a higher settlement rate on the 3D printed tiles. This is especially significant as the 3D printed treatment tiles were not pre-conditioned with a surface biofilm known to induce settlement and metamorphosis in recruiting corals [31] . However, the mean growth rates of spat on the 3D printed tile treatments were more than 50% lower than P. astreoides settled onto pre-conditioned limestone tiles. As spat growth rate has been shown to be inversely proportional to mortality risk [32] , a slow growth rate could have significant implications for juvenile survivorship. Future experiments should consider pre-conditioning 3D printed tiles to differentiate how spat growth is impacted by the presence of a biofilm and the material.",

After 12 weeks in the current study, survival ranged from 21% (nGen) to 48% (SS). While the rate of survival for P. astreoides settled on 3D printed tiles under controlled conditions is higher than the rates found in other studies, it is likely that mortality would increase if tracked in situ. Newly settled corals are extremely vulnerable to predation and abiotic stressors, resulting in low rates of juvenile survivorship [34] . However, it can be inferred from the results of this study that 3D printed materials did not have increased immediate or latent post-settlement effects on P. astreoides survival under controlled conditions. Future studies should track growth and survivorship of juvenile corals on 3D printed substrate in a reef setting.",

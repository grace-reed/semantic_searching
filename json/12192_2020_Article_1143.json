In the present study, we reported the first molecular characteristics of HSP70 (designated as CeHSP70) and HOP (designated as CeHOP) genes from the freshwater green algae Closterium ehrenbergii and examined the changes in their expression profiles under heat stress and toxic chemicals treatment. CeHSP70 presented the conserved motif patterns and EEVD domain specific to cytosolic HSP70; CeHOP contained a typical domain of TPR repeats. Real-time PCR analysis showed that thermal stress considerably up-regulated both CeHOP and CeHSP70. In addition, the genes were significantly induced by CuCl 2 , CuSO 4 , and NiSO , but not by K Cr 2 O 7 , herbicide, and endocrine disrupting chemicals. These results suggest that CeHOP and CeHSP70 function together and play a role in responses to specific stressors and indicate their possible use as sensitive specific biomarkers in risk assessments.",

Atrazine was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain a stock solution and the maximum amount of DMSO was 0.01% in all test cultures, as the concentration (0.01%) of DMSO has no effect on the organism (Kim et al. 2020) . The tested concentrations of individual chemicals were based on the EC 50 values meas Table 2 ). All samples were performed in triplicate and all dilutions were prepared from standard stock solutions.",

A reaction mixture for each PCR run was prepared using the TOPreal qPCR 2X PreMIX (SYBR Green) Kit (Enzynomics, Daejeon, Korea). The cycle parameters were as follows: preincubation (for UDG) of 4 min at 50\u00b0C, initial denaturation of 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 39 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 15 s, and 72\u00b0C for 15 s; a dissociation step was included: 62\u00b0C for 2 s and 95\u00b0C for 20 s. All reactions were amplified in three technical replicates and the average values were calculated. Alpha tubulin (TUA), actin (ACT), and histone H4 were used as an internal control (Lee et al. 2015) . The relative quantification of gene expressions among the treatment groups was analyzed using the cycle threshold (Ct) method (Livak and Schmittgen 2001) , where Ct is the cycle number at which the fluorescent signal rises statistically above the background. All data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test to compare the relative gene expression levels. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

CeHOP showed a consistent up-regulation of~2.5-fold, with a highest up-regulation of 3-fold at 36\u00b0C; similarly, HOP transcripts increased with increasing temperatures in the soybean Glycine max (Zhang et al. 2003) . CeHSP70 showed an up-regulated response in a temperature dependent manner, with approximately 2-fold changes at both 28\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C and 3-fold changes at 36\u00b0C when compared to the control (20\u00b0C). The expression levels of CeHSP90 showed an up-regulation similar to that observed for HSP70, in a temperature dependent manner, with a maximum of 4.5-fold changes at the highest temperature. These results were in accordance with heat responsive patterns of HSP70 and HSP90 in other microalgae (Rosic et al. 2011; Guo et al. , 2013 Guo et al. , 2015 . These suggest that CeHSP70 and CeHSP90 may have a role in the first line of defense against thermal fluctuations in the environments. Therefore, the HOP (since it is the organizing protein for HSP70/HSP90 and an important element in the activity of both HSP70 and HSP90) may be a key element of thermo-resistance in C. ehrenbergii. Figure 2 shows the response of HSP70, HSP90, and HOP upon treatments with different concentrations of toxic metals. Copper and nickel treated cells in exponential cultures showed a general up-regulation in the response of all tested genes. CuCl 2 treatments resulted in an up-regulation of both genes, with a more significant response for HOP with increased concentration; the response was up to 17-fold changes at 0.2 mg/L and decreased but still demonstrated significant 12-fold changes at a concentration of 0.5 mg/L (Fig. 2a) . CuSO 4 treatments showed a continuous up-regulation of CeHOP in a concentration-dependent manner with the highest transcriptional changes of 10.5-fold compared to the control. CeHSP70 and CeHSP90 transcripts increased for lower concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 mg/L, with 5-fold changes for CeHSP90 at a concentration of 0.2 mg/L, and a decrease in transcription nearing that of the control for CeHSP70 at higher concentrations (0.2 and 0.5 mg/L) and 3fold changes for CeHSP90 at 0.5 mg/L (Fig. 2b) . CeHSP70 showed a down-regulation at low concentrations of K 2 Cr 2 O 7 (1 and 2 mg/L) and a slight increase in the transcription of the Fig. 3 Effect of atrazine (a), endosulfan (b), and PCB (c) on the expression of CeHOP, CeHSP70, and CeHSP90. Error bars represent the standard deviation. Significant differences between the control and treated sample, as determined by one-way ANOVA, are highlighted *P < 0.05 gene at concentrations of 3 and 4 mg/L. CeHSP90 transcripts increased by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold changes at concentrations of 3 and 4 mg/L, respectively. CeHOP was induced with a marginally significant (P < 0.05) change of 1.8-fold at the highest concentration of 4 mg/L (Fig. 2d) . These results were in accordance with a previous study regarding C. ehrenbergii small HSPs genes, which were induced in response to copper stress and showed no apparent changes to chromium treatments (Abassi et al. 2019) . HOP, HSP70, and CeHSP90 showed high responses to different chemical treatments at concentrations lower than the EC 50 ; our genes were induced at 0.05 mg/L of CuCl 2 and CuSO 4 when the EC 50 for both chemicals were previously reported to be 0.24 mg/L and 0.20 mg/L, respectively (Supplementary Table 2 ). EC 50 for nickel sulfate was 1.53 mg/L and both HSP70 and CeHSP90 were induced at a concentration of 0.1 mg/L. The overall results showed high sensitivity toward certain chemicals but not others for HSP70, HSP90, and HOP, suggesting they might be involved in the early responses for certain stresses, making them perfect candidates as sensitive specific biomarkers for risk assessments.",

HSP90 responded to PCB concentrations lower than the EC 50 , suggesting that it might be involved in early processes that counter PCB stress in C. ehrenbergii. EDCs such as PCB and endosulfan have the potential to cause oxidative stress by ROS generation (Shao et al. 2012) . The toxic effect of ECDs has been extensively studied in higher organisms and recent studies showed that they also have toxic effects on microalgae even if these are considered as non-target organisms (Liu et al. 2010; Ki 2012, 2016) . Microarray analysis of dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum by PCB exposure showed different responses from various genes involved in different cell pathways, suggesting that the EDC did not cause chloroplast and oxidative damage, but could lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Wang et al. 2018) . We did not observe any effect of the EDCs on the transcriptional response of CeHOP and CeHSP70 of C. ehrenbergii. Similarly, our previous studies on P. minimum HSP90 and D. brightwellii HSP70 and HSP90 showed that these genes did not respond to EDCs (Guo et al. , 2013 . The overall results suggest that HSPs genes, and consequently HOP, have no major role in the EDC stress response of C. ehrenbergii.",

CeHOP, CeHSP70, and CeHSP90 showed a coupled response to different stresses; however, the over-expression of the HOP gene over that of HSP70 and HSP90 suggests it might be involved in much more than the co-chaperone activity for the HSP70/HSP90 complex. HSPs genes have been already suggested as biomarkers in microalgae (Chankova et al. 2013; Guo et al. 2013) ; thus, HOP might be used as a biomarker to predict the action of species, and collect data of various genes transcriptions to design a response profile to external stress factors, which might help in the protection and monitoring of aquatic environments. This is the first study to evaluate the expression profiles of HSP70, HSP90, and HOP together in microalgae, and to our knowledge, there are no reports on the characterization of HOP genes from green algae. Therefore, this study has paved a way for further studies regarding the complex HOP/HSP70/HSP90 to understand the interaction between these genes and their mode of action, and especially to elucidate the roles of HOP in stress responses.",

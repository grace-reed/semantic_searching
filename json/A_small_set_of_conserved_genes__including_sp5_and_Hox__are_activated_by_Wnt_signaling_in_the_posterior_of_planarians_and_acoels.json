                "text": "How body axes are formed is a central problem in animal development and evolution. The body plans of bilaterally symmetric animals (the Bilateria) are typically organized along the anterior-posterior (AP) or head-tail axis, the dorsal-ventral (DV) or back-belly axis, and the medial-lateral (ML) axis. Pre-bilaterians, such as cnidarians, can have tissue organized along a primary body axis (oral-aboral). Despite the large diversity of body plans across the Metazoa, a central feature of anterior-posterior and oral-aboral axes is the polarized expression of Wnt signaling ligands that act through the transcriptional effector \u03b2-catenin, commonly referred to as canonical Wnt signaling, and their antagonists [1] . This can result in a gradient of Wnt signaling activity that regulates pattern of tissue distribution on the primary axis during development and regeneration [1] . For example, in Hydra, Wnt signaling promotes oral identity on the oral-aboral axis, and over-activation of the Wnt pathway leads to formation of ectopic tentacles along the body column [2, 1] . In planarians, inhibition of Wnt signaling causes loss of tail identity and the formation of ectopic heads in the posterior and laterally [3] [4] [5] . In frogs, a gradient of Wnt signaling activity is required for AP neural patterning [6, 7] . In mice, Wnt signaling is required during early AP axis establishment, and its activation marks the future posterior [8, 9] . A key question that arises from the observation that Wnts specify posterior fates broadly across animals is whether a conserved Wnt-dependent transcriptional program acts to establish these posterior identities.",

Acoels are worms within the phylum Xenacoelomorpha that has been placed at the base of the Bilateria, in a sister taxa to all other bilaterians [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . This current phylogenetic placement suggests that planarians and acoels are separated by >550 million years of evolution and that comparisons between them can provide insight into core features of bilaterians [16] . Both species utilize adult stem cells called neoblasts to replace differentiated cells in a process of tissue turnover [17, 12, 18, 19] . Both species require Wnt signaling for maintenance of the AP axis during tissue turnover, as well as for AP regeneration [3] [4] [5] 20, 12] . Although AP axis maintenance and re-establishment are not equivalent to axis formation during embryogenesis, their study in these species can provide insight into conserved patterning mechanisms that also occur during development. Because posterior Wnt signaling activity is constitutive in planarians and acoels, Wnt-regulated genes are continuously expressed in the tail, enabling their study.",

RNAi of \u03b2-catenin genes, which encode the downstream effector of canonical Wnt signaling, leads to progressive loss of tail identity and gain of head identity in planarians and acoels [3] [4] [5] 20, 12, 25, 30] . Wnt signaling has been found to promote the expression of tail and trunk patterning genes and to inhibit the expression of anterior-patterning genes [3] [4] [5] 24, 25, 27, 28, 30] . The targets of Wnt signaling in acoels remain poorly understood. We inhibited \u03b2-catenin genes by RNAi and performed RNA sequencing of tails at early time points post-RNAi in planarians and acoels to identify acutely Wnt-regulated genes in both species. Genes encoding patterning factors, well known to be expressed in planarian muscle, acutely change expression after Wnt inhibition. In addition we found that broadly distributed tissues, such as the epidermis and gland cells, also display regional gene expression in a Wnt-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that Wnt signaling can actively maintain regional gene expression in multiple adult differentiated cell types. A small group of conserved genes were most sensitive to changes in Wnt signaling in both species. This group included Hox genes and a gene encoding the transcription factor SP5, which is a direct Wnt target in vertebrates [31, 32] . In planarians, these genes were expressed in many tissue types and displayed the earliest detectable gene expression pattern changes during regeneration, after the initial phase of wound-induced gene expression. Post-2d, a planarian posterior Hox gene, was found to be required for normal tail regeneration. sp5 is much less studied than Hox genes as a candidate central regulator of the AP axis of animals broadly. Recent work in Hydra has shown that sp5 acts in a feedback loop with Wnt3 to restrict head organizer formation [33] . Functional analysis of sp5 in planarians and acoels revealed that it acts to down-regulate expression of trunk genes in the tail. In planarians, trunk gene expression is Wnt-dependent. This suggests the existence of a Wnt signaling circuit that can promote different spatial identities on the primary axis through activation of SP5 in the tail and SP5-mediated inhibition of Wnt-regulated trunk genes.",

Prior studies have identified a variety of planarian genes that change their expression following \u03b2-catenin-1 perturbation [24, 25, 27, 30] . ndl-3 and ptk-7 are known to be down regulated by 12 days post \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi and teashirt is down regulated as early as 4 days after \u03b2catenin-1 inhibition [24, 27] . RNA sequencing studies found a host of genes that display expression changes by 16 days following initiation of \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi, a timepoint at which 788 genes were differentially expressed [25] . To identify the genes most acutely regulated by Wnt signaling, we utilized tails from uninjured animals and RNA sequencing at early timepoints (day 1, day 2, day 4, and day 6) following RNAi initiation ( Fig 1A) . We reasoned that this early-timepoint post-RNAi approach could determine the changes that occur prior to AP-tissue-type transformation and therefore identify the Wnt-regulated program that lies upstream of tissue-type identity. Differential expression analysis was performed to determine genes down and up regulated at each of these time points with a p adj <0.05 and a log 2 -fold change less than -0.5 or greater than 0.5. 1,276 genes (636 down-regulated, 638 up-regulated) that were differentially expressed at any timepoint were subjected to hierarchical clustering to study patterns of gene expression change after \u03b2-catenin-1 inhibition (S1A and S2A Figs and S1 Table) . At the earliest timepoint, only 43 genes were differentially expressed in this analysis.",

We reasoned that genes that follow a similar gene expression trajectory as \u03b2-catenin-1 after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi are good candidates to be targets of Wnt signaling. In addition, 29/52 genes in this cluster were contained within the 348 genes previously reported to be significantly down-regulated 16 days after \u03b2catenin-1 RNAi [25] (S2 Table) . Thus, our approach identified a subset of genes regulated by Wnt signaling that respond acutely and identified novel genes that were not found in previous analyses. 34/52 genes in this cluster had known expression patterns or were screened here by in situ hybridization. 29/34 were expressed in the planarian posterior including 19/22 genes known to be expressed in a posterior-to-anterior transcriptional gradient in planarian muscle cells [34, 28] (S2 Table) . This set of 19 genes includes posteriorly expressed position control genes (PCGs)-genes with constitutive regional expression that are predicted to be part of a planarian-patterning pathway or have a patterning abnormal RNAi phenotype. We confirmed that expression of known posterior genes sp5, lox5a, and Post-2c was down regulated by day 6 post-\u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi (Fig 1D) . Smed-ferritin which was expressed in a few cells in the tail was also down regulated early after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi (Fig 1D) . The previously uncharacterized ALDH2, BCKHDA, and gucy1b2 genes, were expressed in the posterior epidermis and additionally in other regions and cell types (S1B-S1F Fig) . Using in situ hybridization we found that in each case, specifically the posterior expression domains of these genes were \u03b2-catenin-1",

                "text": "We also identified a cluster of 56 genes that were steadily up-regulated in planarian tails after Wnt inhibition (Fig 2A and 2B, S2A Fig and S2 Table) . Significant up-regulation of these genes, which include known anterior PCGs, began by day 2 post initiation of RNAi and was robust by day 4 post-RNAi ( Fig 2C) . This indicates that the up-regulation of patterning molecules associated with head identity after Wnt inhibition occurs much earlier than previously known, but still following the initial down-regulation of posterior genes. 34/56 genes identified in this cluster were among 440 genes previously determined to be significantly up-regulated 16 days after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi [25] (S2 Table) . 30/56 genes had known expression patterns, or were screened here by in situ hybridization. 28 of these 30 genes were expressed in the planarian anterior including 14/21 genes previously identified to be regionally expressed in anterior muscle [28] (S2 Table) . in situ hybridizations revealed that uncharacterized genes in this cluster were anteriorly expressed, with several expressed in the epidermis and parenchymal cell types ( Fig 2D and S2B-S2I Fig) . For instance, dd_8729 was expressed in the eyes and head tip. After \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi this gene was ectopically expressed in foci in the posterior (Fig 2D) . Appearance of ectopic expression foci resembles changes in the expression of anterior PCGs, such as sFRP-1 (encoding a candidate Wnt-inhibitory secreted frizzled-related protein), after \u03b2-catenin-1 inhibition, with foci marking the location of ectopic head formation [3, 25, 28] . The genes dd_12049, dd_6380, and dd_11499 were expressed in the anterior epidermis, with expression spreading toward the posterior after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi (Fig 2D and S2B-S2E Fig) . dd_5811 and dd_1379 were expressed in the pre-pharyngeal region in parenchymal cell types and dd_2184 (trig-1) was expressed in mag-1 + marginal adhesive glands cells in the trunk, with little detectable expression in the tail (Fig 2D and S2F-S2I Fig) . However, the cell types in which these genes are expressed do exist in the tail [35] , suggesting that the dd_5811, dd_1379, and trig-1 genes are regionally expressed within parenchymal cell type populations that exist broadly on the AP axis. After \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi, expression of these genes increased in the posterior parenchyma ( Fig 2D) . This suggests that in addition to formation of ectopic foci of anterior gene expression in the posterior, inhibition of Wnt signaling can lead to shifting domains of gene expression along the AP axis. Whereas AP regional expression of genes in planarian muscle is well established, our data suggests that other cell types, such as the epidermis, marginal adhesive gland cells, and other parenchymal cell types, also regionally express genes along the AP axis. The anterior restriction of such regional expression in multiple differentiated tissues can be maintained by constitutive Wnt signaling.",

Previous work has shown that ectopic expression of anterior PCGs like sFRP-1 in the tail of planarians after \u03b2-catenin-1 inhibition requires formation of new tissue [25] . To determine whether early changes in gene expression after \u03b2-catenin-1 inhibition could occur in existing mature cells or required new cells generated from neoblasts during tissue turnover, we utilized irradiation to ablate neoblasts and RNA sequencing to study this question at a transcriptome-wide scale (S3A Fig). 10/52 genes described above to be acutely down-regulated after Wnt inhibition displayed significantly reduced expression Table) . This list included genes encoding Wnt-pathway components, such as fz4-1 (encoding a Frizzled Wntreceptor-family protein), and a gene encoding the transcription factor SP5 (S3B Fig) . Genes expressed in non-muscle differentiated cells in the posterior (BCKHDA and ferritin) also displayed reduced expression. Although 42/52 genes in this subset did not pass a significance threshold of p adj < 0.05, many still displayed reduced expression after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi in tails of irradiated animals. We validated the reduction of several of these genes by in situ hybridization. sp5, as well as the Hox genes hox4b and lox5a displayed reduced expression after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi in irradiated animals, suggesting that down-regulation of posterior gene expression can occur in existing tissue, instead of only passively by the replacement of posterior cells with cells of anterior identity (S3C Fig) .",

RNA-sequencing revealed that 1/56 genes previously identified as up-regulated early after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi (dd_5811) displayed significantly increased expression in the tail after irradiation as well (S3D Fig and S3 Table) . This result was validated by in situ hybridization (Fig 2E) . Therefore, the posterior expansion of dd_5811 expression in the parenchyma does not require new cell formation. Although no anterior PCGs passed a significance threshold of p adj < 0.05, wnt2 displayed increased expression after irradiation in \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi tails by RNA-sequencing (S3D Fig) . Indeed, the normally anterior-restricted expression domain of wnt2 expanded posteriorly after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi in irradiated animals by in situ hybridization (S3E Fig) . Previous work has shown that anterior PCGs, such as ndk, ndl-1, ndl-2, and ndl-5 also display subtle posterior expansion of anterior expression domains after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi [28, 30] . For ndl-2 and ndl-5, this expansion occurs before formation of ectopic foci of PCG expression in the posterior [28] . We found that posterior expansion of ndl-2 and ndl-5 gene expression also occurred in irradiated \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi animals ( Fig 2E) . These findings suggest that Wntdependent maintenance of posterior gene expression and restriction of anterior gene expression domains, for at least some regionally expressed genes occurs actively in differentiated cells. However, fate changes in neoblasts appear to mediate the subsequent changes in regional gene expression that lead to ectopic foci of anterior PCG expression and head formation.",

Wnt-dependent gene expression changes have not been thoroughly studied in acoels. Therefore, we first identified early timepoints after initiation of \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi at which detectable changes in gene expression occurred in Hofstenia. We used in situ hybridization to study known PCGs in uninjured animals. Ectopic expression of the anterior PCG sFRP-1 in the posterior occurred at a low frequency by day 6 post-initiation of \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi, and in all animals tested by day 14 after RNAi (S4A Based on these results we performed injections of control or \u03b2-catenin-1 dsRNA followed by RNA-sequencing of tails at day 3, day 7, and day 14 post injection, to capture gene expression changes before and after detectable PCG changes occurred by in situ hybridization ( Fig 3A) . Differential expression analysis was performed at each of these time points and all differentially expressed genes with p adj <0.1 and a log 2 -fold change less than -0.5 or greater than 0.5 were subjected to hierarchical clustering to study temporal patterns in gene expression (S4B and S4C Fig and S4 Table) . A more lenient p adj cutoff was used in Hofstenia miamia because of the larger phenotypic variability observed after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi compared to planarians. We found, similar to the case in planarians, a group of 66 genes that were steadily downregulated after \u03b2-catenin-1 inhibition and that clustered with \u03b2-catenin-1 (Fig 3B, S4B Fig and  S5 Table) . This cluster contained known posterior PCGs fz-1 and fz-2 [12] . We cloned 13 genes from this cluster and found that 11/13 were expressed in the tail by in situ hybridization ( Fig 3C) . Notable among these genes was an sp5 transcription factor-encoding gene, a Hox gene, a gene encoding a T-box transcription factor, and genes encoding predicted Wnt-pathway components including axin-1, tcf-1, and tcf-4, as annotated by best human BLAST hit. A group of 92 genes was up-regulated after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi (Fig 4A and 4B, S4C Fig and S5  Table) . This cluster included the anteriorly expressed genes wnt-5 and fz-7 [12] . Candidates from this cluster were screened by in situ hybridization to determine their expression patterns. Out of 28 genes cloned, we were able to determine the expression pattern of 11. All 11 genes were expressed in the anterior (Fig 4C) . Expression of these genes was found to spread toward the posterior after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi (Fig 4C) . This set included genes annotated as ZIC3 and PKNOX2 (prep) by best human BLAST hit. Homologs of zic and prep genes are important regulators of anterior regeneration in planarians [37] [38] [39] . These anterior genes were expressed in multiple differentiated cell types including the epidermis and sub-epidermal cells (S2D-S2E Fig) .",

                "text": "We compared the \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi RNA-seq datasets obtained from planarians and acoels to identify genes that are candidates to represent a Wnt-regulated posterior program widely in the Bilateria. We compared the group of genes that clustered with \u03b2-catenin-1 after RNAi in planarians and in acoels by BLAST (e<1 \u221206 ), and obtained a list of 5 gene families that were down-regulated in both species. This included an sp5 family transcription factor gene, Hox genes, frizzled homologs, an axin gene, and a guanylate cyclase homolog ( Fig 5A) . Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine that the sp family transcription factor genes identified in both species encode SP5 homologs (S5A Fig) . In planarians, of thirteen known Hox genes, four were down-regulated early after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi. These four genes are expressed in the posterior. Post-2c and Post-2d have been previously annotated as posterior Hox genes with high confidence by phylogenetic analyses [40] . hox4b has not been confidently placed by phylogenetic analysis and lox5a belongs to the spiralian-specific 'lox' Hox group [40] . RNAi has yet to reveal a patterning role for Hox genes in planarians [40, 28] . In Hofstenia miamia, a single posterior Hox gene homolog, Hof-postHox, was down-regulated early after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi ( Fig  3B) . We identified two additional Hofstenia miamia Hox genes: a Hox1 homolog (Hof-Hox1) and a central Hox We also found a Hofstenia caudal homolog (Hof-Cdx), which was expressed in the trunk and tail of hatchlings, along with some expression in the anterior (S5B and S5C Fig) . Cdx was not significantly affected after Wnt inhibition by RNA sequencing. We found that both guanylate cyclase homologs identified as down-regulated after Wnt inhibition in planarians and acoels are expressed in the posterior and encode subunits of the GUCY1 family of soluble guanylate cyclase proteins ( Fig 3C, S1F and S6A Figs) . These proteins can act as receptors for nitric oxide or oxygen [43] . Planarian dd_12650 was found to encode a predicted member of the Gucy1b2 family of beta-subunits, and the encoded protein lacks a heme nitric oxide-binding domain. The Hofstenia miamia 9852410 transcript encodes a predicted member of the Gucy1a family of alpha subunits (S6A Fig) . Finally, the T-box transcription factor-encoding Brachyury gene is a known Wnt target in vertebrates [44, 45] . Planarians do not have a detected Brachyury homolog [46] (S6B Fig) , however, a gene encoding a T-box-family transcription factor was down-regulated early after Wnt inhibition in Hofstenia miamia. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this gene in fact encodes a Brachyury homolog and that acoels have 7 additional Tbx family genes (S6B Fig) . These findings suggest that a common and small Wnt-driven posterior program of gene expression including sp5, posterior Hox genes, Brachyury, guanylate cyclase genes, and genes encoding Wnt-pathway components themselves, is conserved across distantly related extant bilaterians.",

                "text": "The small list of conserved Wnt-regulated genes between planarians and Hofstenia prominently highlights Hox genes and sp5. Since Wnt signaling plays a key role in AP axis regeneration, we sought to determine the dynamics of sp5 and Hox gene expression changes after amputation in planarians. sp5 was expressed at posterior-facing wounds of regenerating head and trunk fragments by 24 hours after amputation (S7A Fig) . This result is consistent with analysis of Wnt-regulated tail genes, including sp5, Hox, and posterior PCGs like wntP-2, at 16 hour wounds of regenerating fragments by RNA sequencing [30] . In addition, the expression of sp5 in regenerating trunk and tail fragments was re-scaled by 24 hours post-amputation (S7A Fig) . This time-point for re-scaling from anterior-facing wounds precedes not only new tissue differentiation but also substantial changes in the expression of canonical posterior PCGs like wntP-2 [22, 23] . To determine if changes in sp5 and Hox gene expression during regeneration precede re-establishment of known PCG expression domains we performed double FISH for these genes and the posterior PCG wntP-2. lox5a, hox4b, and Post-2c, like sp5, all displayed re-scaled gene expression in tail fragments by 24 hours post amputation (Fig 5B,  S7G Fig) . hox4b and Post-2c displayed robust expression by 24 hours at posterior-facing wounds of regenerating head fragments (Fig 5C) . Conversely, wntP-2 did not display re-scaled expression away from the anterior-facing wound of tail fragments by 24 hours post-amputation and was only lowly expressed by 24 hours post-amputation at the posterior-facing wound of head fragments (Fig 5B and 5C, S7G Fig) . In addition, these changes in the expression of sp5 and Hox genes during regeneration were irradiation insensitive ( Fig 5D) . This suggests that during regeneration, after wound-induced gene expression, conserved, acutely Wnt-sensitive targets like sp5 and Hox are the first genes to change expression domains, preceding changes in other patterning genes and occurring in pre-existing tissue near the injury.",

By contrast, most planarian posterior PCGs are expressed largely specifically in muscle [34] . We utilized FISH to further assess the identities of posterior cell types that express sp5, and found that sp5 was expressed in neurons, neoblasts, muscle, cathepsin + cells (which include phagocytic cells [47] ), and marginal adhesive gland cells in the tail (Fig 6C) . Interestingly, Post-2d and Post-2c also displayed broad expression in multiple cell types in the posterior, whereas hox4b and lox5a were largely expressed in muscle and epidermis (Fig 6D-6G) . Other conserved Wnt targets axinB, fz4-1, fz4-2, and gucy1b2 were also expressed in multiple cell types in the posterior (S7B-S7F Fig) .

Although Hox genes are expressed during regeneration in many organisms, their functional role during this process is poorly understood. The role of planarian Hox genes in adult homeostasis and regeneration is unknown despite efforts to inhibit their expression by RNAi [40, 28] . We performed RNAi of all four planarian Hox genes identified as acutely down-regulated after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi in this study (Post-2c, lox5a, Post-2d and hox4b) . Each gene was inhibited individually and all four genes were inhibited together. No defects were observed in homeostasis or regeneration after RNAi of Post-2c, lox5a, hox4b or combinatorial RNAi of all four genes. RNAi of Post-2d caused tail-regeneration defects after amputation in head and trunk fragments (Fig 7A and S8A Fig) . Regenerating tails appeared flat or indented at 5 days after amputation (Fig 7A) . Head regeneration appeared normal in Post-2d RNAi animals ( Fig 7A  and S8A Fig) . During posterior regeneration, Post-2d RNAi animals expressed the posterior PCGs wntP-2, wnt11-1 and wnt11-2, and formed a wnt1 + posterior pole, suggesting posterior patterning occurred (Fig 7B and S8B Fig) . However, posterior-pole cells in Post-2d RNAi head fragments frequently deviated from the mid-point of the wound compared to control fragments ( Fig 7B) . In addition, Post-2d RNAi tails lacked expression of the epidermal DV-boundary marker NB.22.1e at the location of indentation, demonstrating a defect in production of normal tissues at the regenerating tail tip (Fig 7C) . We also inhibited the Hofstenia postHox gene and did not observe any overt macroscopic phenotype. RNA sequencing of postHox RNAi tails from uninjured animals, however, showed down-regulation of Brachyury (S8C Fig) .",

SP5 is also known to directly interact with Tcf1/Lef1 at \u03b2-catenin-target gene enhancers [48] . However, it is debated whether SP5 activates or represses transcription of \u03b2-catenin targets [48, 49] . Recent work in Hydra has shown that Hy-sp5 is also positively regulated by Wnt signaling and represses Wnt targets [33] . In order to determine the role of sp5 in planarians, we performed sp5 RNAi followed by RNA sequencing of tails at various time points in uninjured animals. Analysis of this sequencing data revealed a small number of genes affected after sp5 RNAi. Surprisingly, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression of posterior genes known to be \u03b2-catenin-1 sensitive. However, we found that the expression of two PCGs, ndl-3 and ptk-7, was upregulated in the tail after sp5 RNAi at all time points ( Fig 8A and 8B and S7 Table) . The expression of both of these genes is dependent on \u03b2-catenin-1, but both of these genes are expressed in the planarian trunk, with expression excluded from the tail [50, 25, 27] (S8D Fig) . This suggests that sp5 might act to repress the expression of a subset of \u03b2-catenin targets in the tail. Another previously uncharacterized gene (trig-1) was highly up-regulated after sp5 RNAi ( Fig  8A) . This gene is expressed in marginal adhesive gland cells in the trunk region of planarians (S2H and S2I Fig) . However, after sp5 RNAi, expression of this gene extended all the way into the tail in mag-1+ cells (Fig 8B) . This gene was also identified as up-regulated after \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi in tails (Fig 2B and 2D) . These data suggest that sp5 inhibits the expression of multiple Wnt-regulated trunk genes in the tail, promoting subdivision of trunk and tail.",

In addition, like sp5 RNAi, wntP-2 RNAi leads to posterior expansion of ndl-3 expression into the tail [27, 28] . sp5 RNAi enhanced the wntP-2 RNAi phenotype. Compared to wntP-2; control RNAi animals, a greater proportion of sp5; wntP-2 double RNAi animals formed ectopic mouths, and ectopic mouths in this condition appeared more developed (Fig 8E and S8F Fig) . This occurred despite comparable inhibition of wntP-2 expression in both wntP-2; control and sp5; wntP-2 RNAi conditions (S8E Fig) .

Polarized Wnt signaling is a nearly ubiquitous feature of anterior-posterior or oral-aboral axis formation across metazoans [1] . How this signaling pathway can lead to the formation of complex patterns across the head-tail axis is a fundamental question of animal development and evolution. Here we investigated the genes regulated by Wnt signaling in two distantly related bilaterians (planarians and acoels). Our findings (i) identify mechanisms and molecules by which Wnt signaling generates axial pattern, and (ii) identifies a small set of broadly conserved genes that are commonly regulated by Wnt signaling in these species. These two categories of findings are discussed below.",

Previous work has shown that this includes promoting posterior and trunk PCG expression and inhibition of anterior PCG expression [3] [4] [5] 24, 25, 27, 28, 30] . These PCG expression domains were acutely regulated by Wnt signaling in our data-i.e., changing, for some PCGs, in as little as 1-2 days following \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi. The broad PCG expression domains of the AP axis were dynamically regulated by Wnt signaling in mature muscle cells. For instance, \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi in irradiated animals lacking neoblasts caused reduction in posterior PCG expression and shifting of the posterior boundary of some anterior PCG expression domains (in the pre-pharyngeal region). Wnt inhibition leads to the appearance of foci of anterior PCG gene expression in the posterior, associated with ectopic head formation [3, 25, 28] . The appearance of these foci in the posterior occurs subsequent to the irradiation-insensitive changes to the global pattern of PCG expression [28] and does not occur following \u03b2-catenin-1 RNAi in irradiated animals [25] . Our findings together with prior work on Wnt signaling in planarians support the model that Wnts act in a morphogen-like manner to maintain regional gene expression in muscle cells along the planarian AP axis.",

Our approach revealed that not only muscle and neoblasts, but broadly distributed cell types such as the epidermis and parenchymal cells can regionally express genes along the AP axis in a Wnt-dependent manner. This raises the possibility that these broadly distributed differentiated cell types play AP regional roles in planarian physiology. Adult axial tissue pattern emerges in most animals from transient, embryo-specific patterning events (e.g., limb bud formation). In adult planarians, prior work suggests that region-appropriate specification and migration of stem cell progeny during tissue turnover can also generate and maintain axial tissue pattern. We suggest, based upon findings here, a third process for generating and maintaining tissue pattern in adults: a broadly dispersed field of differentiated cells (such as skin and gland cells) can display region-appropriate gene expression that is actively regulated by constitutive adult positional information. Another subset of Wnt-regulated genes, including sp5 and Hox genes, were expressed broadly in the diverse tissue types of the tail, such as muscle, epidermis, and gland cells. Altogether, our work resolves a subset of genes with the earliest expression changes caused by Wnt inhibition, including PCGs and novel genes regionally expressed in other differentiated tissues, and shows that multiple differentiated tissues can dynamically maintain region-appropriate gene expression in response to constitutive Wnt signaling.",

In planarians, sp5 is expressed in the tail and down-regulated following \u03b2-catenin RNAi [25] . Most work on the role of SP5 as a transcription factor comes from human and mouse cell culture, demonstrating that SP5 influences Wnt target gene expression. However whether SP5 acts as an activator or repressor of these genes has been unclear [48, 49] . Recent work in Hydra has shown that SP5 acts to repress a Wnt target to restrict head organizer activity [33] . We found that planarian sp5 inhibits Wnt-driven expression of trunk genes in the tail to establish trunk-tail expression domains, representing an incoherent feed-forward loop (Fig 9) .

Future work could aim to determine if these genes are direct sp5 targets and the functional role of these gene expression changes in acoels. These results in Hofstenia are similar to our findings in planarians, with sp5 helping to restrict trunk gene expression from the tail.

How such regional expression is regulated across animals is therefore a central problem of developmental biology, yet remains poorly understood. Hox regional gene expression domains can also be maintained in adult tissues, such as in adult skin fibroblasts [54, 55] . The ubiquity of Wnt signaling in polarizing the AP axis and our finding that posterior Hox genes are acutely Wnt-sensitive in planarians and acoels raise the possibility that Wnt signaling regulated the expression of posterior Hox genes in the last common ancestor of the Bilateria. We found that planarian Post-2d is required for appropriate tail regeneration, suggesting that in addition to their known roles during development, Hox genes can be functionally important during regeneration. Post-2d was not required for posterior-patterning gene expression during tail regeneration suggesting a more downstream role in the formation of posterior tissues. In cnidarians, Hox genes have been found to regulate expression of Wnts during early axial patterning [56] . In Hydra, Hox1 expression is Wnt dependent [57] , but the bilaterian Hox1 ortholog is an anterior Hox making this comparison at present unclear. Our data are consistent with a possible central role for Wnt in regulating Hox expression domains-a feature that could prove to be a significant patterning concept broadly in animals.",

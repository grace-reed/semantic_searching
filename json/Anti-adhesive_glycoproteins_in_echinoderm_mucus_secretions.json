As part of our studies of natural antifouling mechanisms, mucus secretions from the starfish Marthasterias glacialis and Porania pulvillus and the brittlestar Ophiocomina nigra have been used to characterise the structure and function of some of the glycoproteins present in these secretions. Mucus was collected from all three species and fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. A high molecular weight glycoprotein fraction was collected from each species. Monosaccharide analysis and FTIR demonstrated a composition consistent with a mucin-type glycoprotein. The mucin from M. glacialis and O. nigra inhibited in vitro bacterial adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the mucin from P. pulvillus promoted bacterial adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. All of the mucins inhibited the adhesion of human neutrophils to cultured human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) and had no anticoagulant activity. The mucins described here have adhesion-regulating functions that may have a role in the antifouling or feeding mechanisms of the organisms that produce them. These mucins may also be of therapeutic value through their ability to regulate human neutrophil adhesion or bacterial adhesion.",

Consequently, many organisms have developed antifouling mechanisms including surface cleaning, surface sloughing, secretion of toxins, and the maintenance of a nonstick surface (Abarzua and Jakubowski, 1995; Wahl, 1989) . Echinoderm mucus secretions are involved in important functions including feeding, attachment, defence, and cleaning (Canicatti and D'Ancona, 1990; Chaet, 1962; Fontaine, 1964) . Filter-feeding species use mucus to capture and parcel food particles; this also acts as a cleaning mechanism which eliminates microscopic fouling organisms (Chaet and Philpott, 1964) . Many species locally secrete adhesive mucus which is important for successful substrate attachment (Thomas and Hermans, 1985) , whereas others may secrete antiadhesive mucus, which prevents colonisation by fouling organisms (McKenzie and Grigovala, 1996) . Mucus secretions may also contain toxins and lytic compounds to deter fouling organisms or predators (Fontaine, 1964) .",

They have varied composition but are commonly rich in glycoproteins, termed mucins, which are characterised by high levels of O-linked oligosaccharides (Strous and Dekker, 1992) . Mucins are a heterogeneous class of compounds including both cell surface species (Shimizu and Shaw, 1993) , which have roles in cell-cell interaction, and secreted species, which have roles in the function of mucus as a physical and biological barrier (for review, see Perez-Vilar and Hill, 1999) . The O-linked sugars are commonly composed of N-acetyl galactosamine, N-acetyl glucosamine, galactose, fucose, and sialic acid (Strous and Dekker, 1992) and are commonly sulphated. Secreted mucins are often very large (N10 6 Da), highly hydrated molecules that form viscous films on surfaces (Perez-Vilar and Hill, 1999; Strous and Dekker, 1992) . Cell surface mucins mediate a number of cellular interactions (Fukuda, 2002) which have been implicated in disease processes, including cancer, inflammation and infection. There have been few studies of the glycoproteins present in marine invertebrate mucus secretions (Fontaine, 1964) ; however, it has been suggested that these contain proteoglycan (PG; McKenzie and Grigovala, 1996) .",

This again is consistent with previous reports (Canicatti, 1989; Canicatti and D'Ancona, 1990; Fontaine, 1964) and is probably due to the presence of saponins (Iorizzi, 1993) , although this was not investigated further. Lytic activity was removed by the size-exclusion chromatography procedure described, so that the resulting partially purified material was suitable for subsequent functional analysis. The partially purified glycoprotein consisted of a major component (~50%) of an approximately 2\u00c210 6 Da glyco-protein, and seven minor components of lower molecular mass (~2-4\u00c210 3 Da). These minor components could be either contaminants from incomplete fractionation or degradation products from the major component. The later possibility is supported by the fact that major components of the crude mucus, which are of intermediate molecular mass (~250\u00c210 3 Da), are eliminated by the fractionation. Chemical analyses of the partially purified mucus glycoproteins are consistent with the presence of mucin-type glycoprotein. FTIR analysis of this material from all three species produced very similar spectra, which were also consistent with spectra collected from mammalian mucins. The monosaccharides present in M. glacialis partially purified mucus glycoprotein were the same as those found in coral mucin by Meikle et al. (1987) , but their proportions are substantially different. In the coral mucin, arabinose is the major component, making up nearly 50% of the sample, and GlcNAc and mannose being the other two major sugars. This analysis therefore strongly differentiates between mucins from coral and from M. glacialis. The occurrence of D-arabinose in animal glycoproteins is extremely unusual, having only been previously reported in two coral mucins (Meikle et al., 1987) . Preliminary NMR analysis of M. glacialis partially purified glycoprotein also produced data consistent with a mucin-type glycoprotein. No analysis of the peptide portion of these glycoproteins was carried out. On the basis of the similarity of our data to better characterised mucins, one would expect a high proportion of serine and threonine residues as these are the sites for Oglycosidic linkages (Meikle et al., 1987) . The partially purified material examined in this study is therefore likely to contain a mucin-type glycoprotein. This is likely to be the high molecular weight component of the partially purified material, and it is possible that the minor components of relatively low molecular weight represent subunits of this large molecule. It has been previously reported that echinoderm mucus secretions may contain proteoglycans (McKenzie and Grigovala, 1996) . These are ubiquitous glycoproteins, characterised as a core protein with one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains (Hardingham and Fosang, 1992) . The core protein may also bear varying amounts of covalently attached N-and Olinked oligosaccharides. The GAGs have a linear repeating disaccharide structure of a hexosamine residue and a uronic acid residue up to approximately 100 residues. The lack of GPs heparin (hep) and dermatan sulphate (DS).

The glycoprotein from M. glacialis and O. nigra were shown to block adhesion of bacteria in a static adhesion assay. Furthermore, when we examine the bacteria used for real-time studies, they are seen to have formed large aggregates, presumably due to adhesion to glycoprotein molecules. These results indicate that the mucus glycoproteins are capable of blocking the adhesion sites of, at least some, fouling organisms. The mucus glycoproteins from the filter feeder P. pulvillus enhanced adhesion of bacteria in the static bacterial adhesion assay, probably as part of this species' mechanism for trapping food particles from seawater. No effect was observed with the material from P. pulvillus in the real-time adhesion assay; although it is difficult to interpret this result as there may be a number of reasons why the two assays produced different results, e.g., flow as opposed to static, preincubation, shorter adhesion period. Marine invertebrates may therefore be able to secrete both antiadhesive and proadhesive mucus glycoproteins.",

It was therefore not surprising that in our experiments the echinoderm mucus glycoproteins also acted to inhibit the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells. Initial weak tethering of circulating leukocytes to the endothelium is mediated by selectins followed by the activation of shearresistant adhesion mediated by integrins (Berg et al., 1993) . Among the ligands for the selectins are a number of endothelial mucins (Berg et al., 1993; Shimizu and Shaw, 1993) , which are well placed to mediate the initial stage of leukocyte adhesion because of their extended structure that lifts them above the glycocalyx (Shimizu and Shaw, 1993) . The interaction between leukocyte selectins and endothelial cells is dependent on the expression of specific sugar motifs within mucin oligosaccharides and requires the sulphation of the oligosaccharides (Shimizu and Shaw, 1993) . We propose that the echinoderm mucins may act as competitive inhibitors of this interaction, being preferentially bound by the leukocyte receptors that mediate adhesion in the assay described.",

                "text": "Invertebrates, such as echinoderms, in the marine environment are continually exposed to vast numbers of potential fouling organisms. The echinoderm surface is covered in a cuticle which is rich in glycoproteins, yet these surfaces are very good at resisting fouling (McKenzie and Grigovala, 1996) . The cuticle undoubtedly has properties which make it a low-adhesion surface (i.e., dnonstickT; McKenzie and Grigovala, 1996) , but these properties would not be effective in preventing fouling by organisms which specifically target cuticular components. We propose an antifouling system, whereby the dnonstickT properties of the cuticle are augmented by a mucus film. This film is the first feature encountered when an organism approaches the surface, allowing mucus glycoproteins to bind to fouling organisms before they reach the true surface. This hypothesis allows for the competitive inhibition of surface adhesion by organisms which have developed mechanisms to target cuticular glycoproteins. The protective function of secreted and membrane-bound mucins is widely accepted in mammalian biology (Carson et al., 1998; Strous and Dekker, 1992; Van Klinken et al., 1995) . Abnormalities of mucus glycoprotein production or structure are also implicated in the pathology of many diseases including cystic fibrosis (Strous and Dekker, 1992) , inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (Corfield and Warren, 1996) , bronchitis, asthma (Rose, 1992) and many carcinomas (Makiguchi et al., 1996; Strous and Dekker, 1992) . This study has demonstrated the therapeutic potential of nonmammalian mucins to treat inflammatory disorders by blocking the adhesion of leukocytes.",

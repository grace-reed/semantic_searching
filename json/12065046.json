We present data from eight polymorphic allozyme loci that indicate small, but significant, differentiation between sympatric populations of Acropora cytherea and Acropora hyacinthus (F ST = 0.025-0.068, p \u03fd 0.05), a pair of acroporid corals with very high interspecific fertilization rates in vitro.

By contrast, populations of Acropora tenuis, a species which spawns 2-3 hours earlier and shows low crossfertilization rates with congeners in vitro, were clearly distinct from A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus (F ST = 0.427-0.465, p \u03fd 0.05). Moreover, allopatric populations of A. tenuis differed significantly, possibly as a consequence of its relatively short period of larval competency.

                "text": "Most reef-building corals on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) participate in highly synchronized spawning events (Harrison et al. 1984; Babcock et al. 1986) , which create opportunities for natural hybridization that are unparalleled in the animal kingdom (Babcock 1995) due to high interspecific cross-fertility (Miller & Babcock 1997 ; Willis et al. 1997; Szmant et al. 1997; Hatta et al. 1999) . Genetic studies indicate that introgression-i.e. the interspecific exchange of genes that follows hybridization-may be a common phenomenon in corals. For example, in both Acropora and Madracis, several species share different types of ribosomal DNA (Odorico & Miller 1997; Diekmann et al. 2001) . Also, species-level molecular phylogenies of Acropora, using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers, show extended para-and polyphyly (Hatta et al. 1999; Fukami et al. 2000; . In the mass-spawning genus Platygyra, the seven Indo-Pacific species exhibit high rates of interspecific fertilization (Miller & Babcock 1997 ) and very small genetic distances (Miller & Benzie 1997) indicating that, in this case, hybridization may have led to homogenization of gene pools. Cross-fertilization also occurs among the three members of the Montastrea annularis complex (Szmant et al. 1997) , and there is an ongoing debate about their genetic similarity and taxonomic status (Lopez et al. 1999; Medina et al. 1999) .",

                "text": "Although molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate that interspecific hybridization has played a major role in coral evolution, alternative hypotheses to explain observed patterns of allele and haplotype sharing cannot be rigorously excluded. Two alternative hypotheses that have been widely discussed are (i) that cross-fertile coral species are morphotypes within phenotypically plastic species (Willis et al. 1997) ; and (ii) that these patterns of allele and haplotype sharing reflect recent speciation and retention of ancestral polymorphisms (Diekmann et al. 2001; van Oppen et al. 2001) . Population genetic approaches may have greater potential to distinguish between the rare hybridization versus the 'morphologically plastic species' hypothesis than phylogenetic analyses, because comparisons are based on differences in allele frequencies, which can occur over much shorter time-frames than the mutational changes on which phylogenetic analyses are based. Thus, sympatric populations of two species that hybridize frequently would be expected to be more similar than allopatric populations within each species. Conversely, no, or infrequent, hybridization is predicted to lead to greater allele frequency differences between species in sympatry than between allopatric populations within species.",

A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus have one of the highest rates of interspecific fertilization in vitro (a mean of 50%) (Willis et al. 1997) , whereas A. tenuis spawns 2-3 hours earlier than its congeners during mass spawning events and also has low interspecific compatibility in breeding trials.

On Trunk Reef, samples from 40 colonies of A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus were collected from one site of ca. 500 m 2 ; the low density of A. tenuis at this site required additional collecting at a site 500 m distant. Due to the low density of both A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus at Dampier, it was necessary to sample these species at more than one site. Tissue samples were collected by snapping off 10 cm pieces from individual colonies. These pieces were maintained in seawater for a maximum of 1 h before a sub-sample was stored in liquid nitrogen. The remaining portions of the samples were bleached and dried to verify identification; these skeletons were compared with the coral collection of The Museum of Tropical Queensland (Townsville, Australia) and their identification was confirmed by C.

We used 12% (w/v) horizontal starch gels. Assay conditions followed Ballment et al. (1997) . Between two and five alleles were detected per locus, and these were described by the ratio of their electrophoretic mobility relative to that of the most common allele.

The frequency of polymorphic loci was high, although the number of alleles per locus was relatively low (table 1). Significant deviations from H-W equilibrium were noted for some locus-population combinations (table 2) . These deviations were mainly due to heterozygote deficits and were correlated with significant inbreeding coefficients (F is ) (table 1). In the case of Me, the number of heterozygotes may have been underestimated due to the fact that the electrophoresis conditions may not have been optimal to resolve small differences in the migration of alleles. However, heterozygote deficits that cause deviations from H-W expectations and large inbreeding coefficients (F is ) are a common feature of coral populations and have been reported previously for A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus (Ayre & Hughes 2000) . It is unlikely that asexual reproduction is responsible for the heterozygote deficits observed in our study, because we found only one multi-locus genotype repeated once.",

These results indicate that hybridization occurs at a very low frequency, i.e. introgression is lower than intraspecific gene flow between widely separated populations; therefore the species are unlikely to be merging. The same pattern was observed when a comparable published allozyme dataset (Ayre & Hughes 2000) was reanalysed (figure 3). The published work examined variation at four loci in A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus populations from three different localities along the GBR, but in this case the data were used for intraspecific comparisons only. For reanalysis, we assumed that alleles with very similar reported electrophoretic mobilities were homologous between species. Note that the estimates of genetic distance and F ST values obtained for the published dataset were larger than those obtained in our study, probably because Ayre & Hughes only used four highly polymorphic loci and because our scoring was more conservative. Unfortunately, these differences in scoring methods made it impossible to combine our datasets. Our comparison between allopatric and sympatric populations provided a reference framework to assess the importance of low levels of genetic differentiation. The low values of Nei's genetic distance between A. hyacinthus and A. cytherea reported here are very similar to those between the Indo-Pacific Platygyra species (Miller & Benzie 1997) , mass-spawning coral species that are also known to hybridize efficiently in vitro (Miller & Babcock 1997) . However, in the case of Platygyra, no comparison was made between sympatric and allopatric populations; thus, the possibility remains that the loci examined were not sufficiently variable to detect subtle differences between recently speciated taxa.",

However, coalescence times are predicted to be short in Acropora species because effective population sizes are likely to be small (M\u00e1rquez et al. 2002) ; hence, fixed allelic differences are predicted to result from even relatively short (on geological time-scales) periods of isolation.

Larval competency correlates with dispersal capacity in Acropora, as patterns of geographical distribution indicate that species found in remote locations have longer larval competency periods (Baird 1998) . Under laboratory conditions, A. tenuis had a much shorter larval competency period (less than 20 days) in comparison to A. hyacinthus (up to 90 days), although no data are available for A. cytherea (Harrison et al. 1984; P. L. Harrison, personal communication) . Allozyme patterns indicative of high connectivity between the GBR and Western Australia have also been found for other marine organisms (e.g. Linckia laevigata and Acanthaster planci ) and are thought to be related to larval transport by present-day current flows and island hopping or to past dispersal events (reviewed in Benzie 1999).",

The allozyme data reported here are consistent with Nested Clade Analysis of nuclear intron sequences, which indicate that A. cytherea and A. hyacinthus are distinct evolutionary lineages (M\u00e1rquez et al. 2002) . These results indicate that cross-fertilization trials overestimate rates of hybridization occurring under natural conditions. Cross-fertilization trials usually involve the use of sperm from only one species with eggs from another (Miller & Babcock 1997; Szmant et al. 1997; Willis et al. 1997; Hatta et al. 1999) . However, during mass-spawning events, eggs are generally exposed to complex mixtures of con-and heterospecific sperm, and in these situations factors such as gamete competition are likely to modify fertilization rates. Alternatively, it has been suggested that disruptive selection could maintain ecologically differentiated coral morphotypes (Willis et al. 1997) , while a certain level of assortative mating can maintain these morphotypes genetically distinct (Dieckmann & Doebeli 1999) . Further work should address the possible role of sperm competition as a reproductive barrier in acroporid corals and examine ecological differences between crossfertile species.",

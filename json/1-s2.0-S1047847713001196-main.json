    "abstract": "One of the most important aspects in the research on reef-building corals is the process by which corals accrete biogenic calcium carbonate. This process leads to the formation of a mineral/organic composite and it is believed that the development of the nano-and microstructure of the mineral phase is highly sensitive to the growth conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of large-scale (10 \u00c2 30 lm) focused ion beam (FIB) prepared lamellae was performed on adult and juvenile scleractinian coral skeleton specimens. This allowed for the investigation of the nano and microstructure and the crystallographic orientation of the aragonite mineral. We found the following microstructural evolution in the adult Porites lobata specimens: randomly oriented nanocrystals with high porosity, partly aligned nanocrystals with high porosity and areas of dense acicular crystals of several micrometers extension, the latter two areas are aligned close to the [0 0 1] direction (Pmcn space group). To the best of our knowledge, for the first time the observed microstructure could be directly correlated with the dark/bright bands characteristic of the diurnal growth cycle. We hypothesize that this mineral structure sequence and alignment in the adult specimen is linked to the photosynthetic diurnal cycle of the zooxanthellea regulating the oxygen levels and organic molecule transport to the calcifying medium. These observations reveal a strong control of crystal morphology by the organism and the correlation of the accretion process. No indication for a self-assembly of nanocrystalline units, i.e., a mesocrystal structure, on the micrometer scale could be found.",

                "text": "Despite the abundance of calcifying organisms within several diverse phyla, the identification and understanding of the calcification mechanism remains a subject of debate (e.g., Al-Horani et al., 2003; Beniash et al., 1997; Cohen and McConnaughey, 2003; Weiner, 2008) . Understanding the calcifying mechanism has become increasingly important given the potential impact of climate change on this process. Ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations will have serious effects on many aspects of marine life and particularly coral reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Kleypas et al., 2006) . Several studies have reported negative impacts on different calcifying organisms (e.g., corals and foraminifera), such as decreasing calcification rates and decalcification (Bijma et al., 2002; Dissard et al., 2010; Fine and Tchernov, 2007) . To address the process of nucleation and growth in corals we characterize the skeletal structure from the nano-to microscale, in both adult and juvenile specimens of different species to investigate both an early growth stage as well as fully developed skeletal features, by electron microscopy based techniques. Scleractinian corals exclusively produce aragonite and the resulting skeleton is hierarchically ordered from the nanometer scale. This has frequently been observed in other biominerals (Fratzl and Weinkamer, 2007) . It is generally accepted that the fundamental structure of the aragonite coral skeleton consist of bundles of acicular crystals situated around a so-called center of calcification (COC) (Bourne, 1887 (Bourne, , 1899 or 'early mineralization zone' (Cuif et al., 2003a,b) forming a three dimensional fan-like structure or spherulite (Cohen and McConnaughey, 2003) .",

Furthermore radial contrast bands have been observed by optical microscopy investigation within spherulites and have often been interpreted as daily growth bands (Barnes, 1970; Risk and Pearce, 1992) (Fig. 1) . Many corals show a precipitation of the granular crystals at night, whereas the acicular crystals mainly form during the day (Cohen and McConnaughey, 2003) . There is still much debate about the nature of these different subunits within the coral skeleton formation process, including key issues such as the crystal continuity (or discontinuity) between the subunits, and whether the aragonite needles are single crystals or form larger domains (Cuif and Dauphin, 2005) . Benzerara et al. (2011) made great progress in the nanoscale characterization of the COC structure in a Porites sp. single specimen by EM methods. Their findings show alignment between the granular crystals within the COC over several micrometers and support a single crystal interpretation of the outward radiating aragonite needles. We aim to take this characterization further by creating a focused ion beam (FIB) lamella without using lift-out which encompasses a complete spherulite, so as to gain structural data not only from the granular COC and neighboring acicular crystals, but also from the subsequent dark optical contrast band (onset of the next daily growth band) and the relation between these three subunits, whilst maintaining the contextual information of the skeleton. Additionally we analyze the microstructural succession of a spherulite in a juvenile Acropora millepora specimen to gain understanding of the impact of growth conditions on the morphologies of the mineral phase.",

The diffraction patterns of nanocrystals within the stacked arrangement show that they are largely aligned with diffraction spots common to a succession of grains, sharing a common zone axis orientation, as shown in Fig. 4 . This was repeated for several areas within the stacked nanocrystalline area of the lamella and showed that most nanocrystals within individual stacks retain a common zone axis over approximately 200-300 nm. Although the nanocrystals retain a specific crystallographic orientation along the stack length axis, successive individual crystals show misalignment resulting in an increasingly out off-zone axis tilt as a function of distance along the stack (Fig. 4) .",

Interpretations of the crystallographic phases present in adult scleractinian corals, however, have varied from granular crystals being present in the COC but being mainly composed of layers of fibers with high amounts of incorporated organics (Gladfelter, 1982; Stolarski, 2003) to randomly oriented nanocrystals in the COC with outward radiating crystal needles (Cuif and Dauphin, 2005) .

Dark (granular and porous) and bright bands (acicular and dense) as observed in optical microscopy correspond to higher and lower porosity respectively, due to increased light scattering by the porous nanocrystalline regions. Many studies suggest that these dark bands are also enriched in organic materials (Cuif et al., 2003a,b; Duerden, 1904; Ogilvie, 1896) . This microstructural feature of dark/bright bands was also studied by SEM, and has been linked to a diurnal growth cycle (Barnes, 1970; Risk and Pearce, 1992) which is likely to be related to photosynthesis performed by the zooxanthellae. Although their direct or indirect impact on calcification is still highly debated (Allemand et al., 2011) it is accepted that on the macroscale the algae enhance calcification rates under illumination (Barnes and Chalker, 1990; Goreau, 1959; Kawaguti and Sakumoto, 1948) . Additionally a clear saturation level change over light-dark cycles of the internal coral pH has been measured (Al-Horani et al., 2003) . In order to discuss this relationship the process of photosynthesis has to be discussed in more detail. Photosynthesis can be described by the reaction equation:",

( , 2011 studied the role of the OH bond in ethanol and other alcohols binding to calcite crystals by a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. They found that ethanol-OH attachment on calcite is stronger than water-OH binding and that the first absorbed layer of ethanol is highly ordered. The strong ordering of the ethanol results in a hydrophobic layer and has therefore a strong impact on mineral growth and dissolution (Sand et al., 2010) . Furthermore, their study showed that the ordering of the ethanol by the calcite extended much further into the liquid as expected from electrical double-layer theory, suggesting that in water with low activity, such as in biomineralizing systems, organic molecules can control ion transport to and from the mineral surface. In this way ion transport is confined to specific locations and hence could provide the organism with control over the mineral morphology and crystallographic orientation.",

By leaving the FIB prepared lamella within the coral skeletal context (no lift out) the lamella is mechanically more stable and durable while being directly comparable to the larger scale (several tens of microns) not ion-milled skeletal areas by optical analysis. Thus we could identify a crystallographic evolution from a center of calcification outward over acicular and granular (daily) bands. In the adult Porites lobata specimen, a succession of randomly orientated nanocrystals with high porosity, followed by partly aligned nanocrystals with high porosity, to dense acicular crystals of several microns in length, was observed. A new layer of nanocrystals followed by the same succession is then repeated, in correlation with the contrast banding seen in transmission light images. We draw a parallel to the diurnal photosynthetic cycle of the zooxanthellae in symbiotic corals that control the levels of oxygen and carbon availabilities, both recognized as significant drivers of coral calcification processes. The transport of large amounts of glycerol by zooxanthellae and its potential impact on coral calcification was also discussed. This process could play a role in the specific alignment of the aragonite crystals as was demonstrated by synthetic experiments with OHgroup containing additives by Sand et al. (2011) and the TEM investigation of these precipitates by the authors. The juvenile Acropora millepora specimen also showed the large acicular crystals interrupted by thin porous bands, but lacked the nanocrystalline phase, which may be linked to the absence of zooxanthellae and thus the typical daily cycle. But at this stage a comparison is not possible as we are dealing with different species and growth rates and morphologies are also likely to play an important role.",

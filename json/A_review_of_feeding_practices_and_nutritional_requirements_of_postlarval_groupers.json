They are a very diverse group of fish comprising at least 115 species within 22 genera of the subfamily Epinephelinae, one of five subfamilies of Serranidae (Baldwin and Johnson, 1993; Williams et al., 2004a) . Biologically, most species are protogynous (change sex from female to male), long-lived and late maturing. Some are small with a maximum size of 250 mm or less such as the plump grouper (Epinephelus trophies), but most are large fish with a mature size of 600-1200 mm while the giant of the group, E. lanceolatus attains a size of 2.7 m and more than 400 kg (Heemstra and Randall, 1993; FAO Fishbase, 2004) . As a group, groupers are probably the most sought-after fish in the live reef fish trade, commanding high prices, especially for species such as humpback grouper (Cromileptes altivelis), red grouper (E. akaara), giant grouper (E. lanceolatus) and the coral trouts (Plectropomus spp) (Petersen et al., 2006; Johnston, 2007) .",

                "text": "Increased fishery effort, combined with the targeting of spawning aggregations and the use of destructive fishing practices, has led to a significant decline in the wild catch of groupers (Sadovy et al., 2003; Scales et al., 2007) and consequently, a heightened need for aquaculture product to supply the market. Early grouper aquaculture was confined to the on-growing of wild-caught juveniles as hatchery rearing of groupers initially proved difficult (Rimmer, 2000; Rimmer et al., 2004) . Consequently, the commonly cultured groupers were the low-value estuarine species E. coioides (often incorrectly referred to as E. tauvina) and E. malabaricus (sometimes referred to as E. salmoides) (James et al., 1998; Rimmer, 2000) whose fingerlings could easily be caught using fish traps placed in near-shore nursery grounds. Feeding chopped-up fishery bycatch (trash fish) remains a common practice for on-growing of these fish to the preferred market size of 1-1.2 kg. Improvement in hatchery technology over the past few years has enabled more valuable grouper species to be cultured and has provided a more reliable supply of grouper fry (Liao et al., 2001; Rimmer et al., 2004) . Together, these developments have enabled grouper aquaculture production to increase rapidly with FAO data showing total production rising from about 5000 metric tonnes (mt) in 1995 to more than 65,000 mt in 2005 (FAO Fishstat Plus, 2007) . Grouper aquaculture is concentrated in Asia with China, Taiwan and Indonesia together providing more than 90% of total global production.",

In reviewing this research, this paper provides an account of feeding practices used to rear juvenile groupers and the nutritional knowledge that has been gathered to enable the production of better and more economical manufactured feeds for grouper grow-out. Developments that have taken place in hatchery technology and larval rearing of groupers are not addressed but this information can be found in the comprehensive reviews of Liao et al.

Following a 10-week grow-out period, average weight of the fish declined slightly as stocking density increased from 15 to 60 fish/m 3 (from 113 to 102 g for the smaller group of fish and 155 to 135 g for the larger group of fish, respectively) but markedly thereafter to 72 g and g respectively for the 120 fish/m 3 stocking density (Fig. 1 ). Survival rate did not differ significantly for fish stocked at densities between 15 and 60 fish/m 3 (from 93 to 96%, irrespective of the starting size) but was lower for fish at the higher stocking rate (83% for the small fish and 89% for the large fish). Although net biomass yield of fish for both starting sizes increased with increasing stocking density, the adverse effects on final weight and fish survival of stocking at 120 fish/m 3 suggested that the optimal stocking density was around 60 fish/m 3 . Abdullah et al. (1987) reported nursery and grow-out stocking density experiments with E. coioides (reported as E. tauvina) cultured in raceways of 7 \u00d7 1.5 m. For the 52-day nursery study with fry of 17 g, stocking at either 200 or 400 fish/m 3 in the raceway (depth of 0.25 m; 2.2 m total volume) resulted in similar end weights (62-64 g) and excellent survival of 98%. For the 31-week grow-out study, fish of 150-170 g initial size were stocked at densities of 5, 20 or 60 fish/m 3 in the raceway (depth of 0.6 m; 6.0 m 3 total volume). Final average size of the fish declined with increasing density (770, 560 and 450 g, respectively; Fig. 2) but final biomass increased (3.9, 7.7 and 14.7 kg/m , respectively); survival decreased from 100% for the two lower densities to 87% for the highest density. Worthy of note was the large within-treatment size variation of the fish in the grow-out study where coefficients of variation increased from 30 to 34 and 44% as stocking density increased from 5 to 20 and fish/m 3 , respectively. In a 12-month grow-out study with E. polyphekadion of 56 to 59 g start weight held in round tanks of 3.0 m dia. and 10 m effective volume, final average fish weight declined nonsignificantly from 545 to 540 and 513 g as stocking density increased from 5 to 15 and 45 fish/m 3 , respectively (James et al., 1998) . Survival declined significantly with increasing stocking density (from 98 to 90 and 85%, respectively) and size variability was again observed with coefficients of variation ranging from 26 to 31%.",

Moreover, increasing stocking density results in a greater variability in fish size, which under commercial conditions would require regular Fig. 1. Effect of stocking density (15, 30, 60 or 120 fish/m 3 ) on growth of E. malabaricus grouper cultured in floating net cages for 70 days (data of Teng and Chua, 1978) . size grading to achieve more optimal production. Thus optimum stocking density will be determined as much by economic considerations as biological performance of the fish per se. This has been highlighted by a bioeconomic analysis of grouper grow-out in Taiwan where modelling of the effect of stocking density within safe fish survival targets resulted in a negative outcome on farm profitability with increasing stocking density (Miao and Tang, 2002) . Grouper stocking densities suggested by SEAFDEC (Anon, 2000 (Anon, , 2001 are as follows. For nursery phase with fry of 25 mm total length, stocking density should be 100 to 150 fish/m 2 . With both pond and floating cage culture, these fish are usually held in a hapa net (typically 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 m) at a stocking of 400 to 600 fish (equivalent to 50 to 75 fish/m 3 ) until a size of about 160 mm. With indoor tank culture, fry of 25 mm should be stocked at 50 to 200/m 3 in static tanks and up to 1000/m 3 in flow-through or recirculated tanks. For the grow-out phase with fish of 60 mm, a stocking density of 5 to 10,000 fish/ha is recommended for pond culture and 15 to 20 fish/m 3 for floating cage culture. For fish of 160 mm and larger, stocking density should be reduced to 14 fish/m 2 with 1000 to 1100 fish being placed in a 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 m floating cage (equivalent to 8 to 9 fish/m 3 ) or up to 5000 fish/ha for pond culture. When groupers are pond cultured, adult tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) are often stocked into the pond at 5 to 10,000/ha one month before introducing the grouper.",

The fish are chopped or minced prior to feeding and a vitamin and mineral supplement may or may not be added. In Taiwan and Japan where there is a more established aquafeed manufacturing industry, raw fish supplemented with compounded feed is increasingly being used for the on-growing of groupers and other high value marine fishes (Chen and Tsai, 1994; Shiau and Lan, 1996) . Interestingly, where direct comparisons have been made between compounded feeds and fishery bycatch for grow-out culture of groupers, growth rates and feed conversions (expressed on a similar dry matter basis) have usually been better with the compounded feed (Chou and Wong, 1985; Ahmad et al., 1991; Tacon et al., 1991) . This suggests that fishery bycatch by itself may not be a nutritionally adequate diet (Boonyaratpalin, 1997) although poor feeding management could be even more important with net cage culture. New (1996) suggested that up to one-third of the issued fishery bycatch passes out of the cage to become a significant pollutant of adjacent waterways. However, fishery bycatch that is fresh, properly prepared and carefully managed can be an excellent and often inexpensive source of feed for groupers. In the Philippines, Bombeo-Tuburan et al. (2001) carried out an economic analysis of pond-cultured E. coioides and found feeding fishery bycatch was more profitable than either manufactured feed or co-culturing with tilapia.",

                "text": "Research to optimise feeding practices and minimise feed wastage has concentrated on feeding frequency and feed rationing effects. With small estuary grouper E. coioides (reported as E. tauvina) of 60-70 g fed fishery bycatch, feeding to satiety every second day was found by Chua and Teng (1978) to be the best practice between extremes of feeding from three times daily to once every five days. Feeding more frequently than alternate days did not significantly advantage fish growth or feed conversion but less frequent feeding brought about a substantial and progressive decline in growth. Adopting this feeding practice for E. malabaricus (reported as E. salmoides) of about 200 g body weight, Chua and Teng (1982) ration-fed fishery bycatch from 2% of body weight to satiety (~9%). Growth rates improved as feed allocation increased but the effect beyond 5% was marginal. Feed conversion (wet) improved curvilinearly as rationing increased, from 5.3 at 2% to 3.2 at 5%, but worsened thereafter, from 4.1 at 8% to 4.7 at 9%. With small (0.5 g) red-spotted grouper (E. akaara), satiation feeding of a formulated pelleted diet was optimised at a frequency of between 2 and 4 times daily (Kayano et al., 1990) . In subsequent work (Kayano et al., 1993) , increasing the feeding frequency from 1 to 8 times daily was found to improve fish growth and feed conversion when red-spotted grouper of 2 to 8 g were fed pelleted feed that was rationed to the same daily allowance of about 2% of body weight. In an 8-week growth study with juvenile E. coioides of~10 g start weight, Luo et al. (2006a) rationed the feeding of an experimental pelleted dry diet from 0 (starvation) to 3.5% of body weight at 0.5% increments. Most productivity measures, including weight gain, feed conversion and protein efficiency ratio, improved as a broken-line response with a feeding rate optimum of 2.5%. Survival however, improved rapidly from 53% at starvation to 75% for the 0.5% feeding rate and then more gradually to 93% as feeding rate increased to 3.5%. Clearly, fish productivity is maximised when fish are fed frequently and at, or close to, satiety. However, this should be qualified in that the nutritional quality of the feed may augment or suppress the fish's response to rationing and/or frequency of feeding. For example, feeding groupers on a diet with a lipid content above 15% can depress appetite with a consequent adverse effect on growth and feed conversion (Shiau and Lan, 1996; Williams et al., 2006b; Tuan and Williams, 2007) .

                "text": "They found that body lipid composition decreased as dietary protein content was increased from 24 to 42% but further increases up to 54% protein resulted in a slight but significant increase in fish adiposity. However, the growth of these fish was exceedingly poor, only 0.18 g/day on the best diet, probably because of the low palatability of the casein/ dextrin diets. Shiau and Lan (1996) examined the protein requirement of E. malabaricus juveniles of 9 g initial weight when fed semi-synthetic diets for 8-weeks that were based on fish meal and starch. They found Table 1 Guidelines for feeding fishery bycatch or pelleted dry feeds to Epinephelinae groupers (after Williams, 2005 growth and FCR of the fish improved linearly as dietary crude protein increased from 0 to 51%, but no further improvement was seen when dietary protein was increased to 57%. Maximum growth achieved by the fish in that experiment was 0.93 g/day, more typical of what would be expected for fish of that size. The lipid composition of the fish in their study increased more or less linearly with increasing dietary protein content. In a second experiment examining protein to energy requirements of juveniles of 10 g initial weight, Shiau and Lan (1996) used diets that contained either 45 or 50% crude protein in combination with four levels of lipid that varied serially between 7 and 18%. In that experiment, fish survival was only 67 to 88% and the best growth was only 0.68 g/day, which occurred on the diet that contained 50% protein and 13% lipid. For both the 45 and 50% protein series, increasing the lipid content above 13% reduced the growth of the fish. However, the efficiency of feed utilization was not impaired with the 50% protein series but it progressively got worse with the 45% protein series. The lipid composition of the fish tended to increase with increasing dietary lipid but with no clear difference between the 50 and 45% dietary protein series. In more recent work, Luo et al. (2004) examined the response of E. coioides juveniles of about 11 g when fed six isoenergetic pelleted dry diets that varied serially in crude protein from 37 to 63%. Using a broken-line regression analysis of the growth data, they determined the optimal dietary protein requirement of the fish to be close to 48%. However, re-examination of their data using a second order polynomial analysis gave an excellent fit (R 2 = 0.97) with a maximum growth response at a dietary crude protein level of about 54%; a similar polynomial analysis of the FCR response showed it was best at a dietary protein content of 55.5% ( Fig. 3 ). Lin and Shiau (2003) examined the optimum dietary lipid specification of fingerling E. malabaricus of 4 g initial size. Using a casein/starch purified diet, they formulated five diets in which lipid levels increased serially from 0 to 16%. In the 8-week experiment, growth rate, FCR and protein efficiency ratio were best and similar for fish fed diets with to 12% lipid and significantly better than those fed 16 or 0% lipid. Increasing the lipid level in the diet sequentially increased body adiposity while fish fed the 0% lipid diet had low survival (61%) compared to other treatments in which survival varied from 86 to 100%. Interestingly, fish fed diets with 8% or more lipid had higher plasma lysozyme and alternative complement activities than those fed the lower lipid diets, which suggests that dietary lipid supplementation above 4% is necessary for an effective immune response. A similar finding was reported by Luo et al. (2005b) who examined the effect of dietary lipid levels on growth performance and body composition of E. coioides juveniles (11 g initial weight) cultured in floating net cages. They fed six isonitrogenous diets (53% crude protein dry matter) in which dietary lipid was varied serially from 5 to 16% (dry matter basis) in an 8-week comparative slaughter experiment. The best growth was seen with fish fed the 9% lipid diet although this was not significantly better than fish fed either the 7 or 12% lipid diets. Feed intake varied inversely with dietary lipid levels with FCR and protein efficiency ratio being worst for fish fed the 5% lipid diet. Body lipid content increased directly with increasing dietary lipid levels, from 2.9% for the 5% lipid diet to 5.6% for the 16% lipid diet. Based on second-order polynomial analysis, weight gain was optimised with a dietary lipid level of 10%.",

They found a DM protein content of 55-56% optimised growth, FCR and dietary energy retention of the fish while N retention was maximised at a slightly lower protein level of 49%. Most productivity measures were optimised with a dietary DM lipid content of 12-13%. However, higher lipid levels markedly reduced feed intake while higher dietary protein levels had an opposite effect. Thus, fish fed the highest protein and lipid diets were fattest whereas those fed the lowest protein and highest lipid diets contained a comparatively low amount of body lipid. The authors attributed this response to be a direct consequence of a reduced feed intake elicited by diets high in lipid.",

Thus for fish approaching market size, diets high in protein (\u226553%) and moderately low (10-12%) in lipid are needed for optimal productivity.",

(2006b) and evaluated against a high protein (82% DM CP), low lipid (5.6% DM) control diet. Increasing the amount of lipid in the experimental diet above that present in the control diet markedly improved the apparent digestibility of the lipid (from 58% to 82-91%, respectively) but the type of lipid or increasing the amount of lipid from 15 to 30% did not significantly affect lipid digestibility. Fish growth and feed intake were significantly depressed when the amount of supplemental lipid was increased from moderate to high levels or when lipid was provided as MCF rather than as LCF. Moreover, FCR was profoundly worse when the amount of MCF was increased from moderate to high levels in the diet. Retentions of dietary protein and energy were significantly altered by the amount and type of lipid in the diet wherein the depression that occurred when the lipid was added as MCF was more marked at the high, than at the moderate level of supplementation. Thus these groupers could efficiently utilise LCF when provided at moderate amounts in the diet (viz, 15%) but high levels (viz. 30%) were detrimental to growth because feed intake was depressed. MCF depressed feed intake and growth of the fish even when given at a moderate supplementation rate. A further insight into the way humpback grouper metabolise different types and amounts of dietary lipid was investigated by Smith et al. (2005) . They tested the hypothesis that high lipid diets promoted greater lipid oxidation and that medium-chain fatty acids would be more rapidly oxidised than long-chain fatty acids. They fed the same diets as used in the study of Williams et al. (2006b) and used a metabolic chamber to measure the oxidation of dietary lipid when radioisotope-labelled 14 C-oleic acid (18:1n\u22129) and 14 C-palmitic acid (16:0) were added to the olive oil as a marker for long-chain fatty acids and 14 C-octanoic acid (8:0) was added to the coconut oil as a marker for medium-chain fatty acids. Fish fed the MCF diets had a significantly higher respiration rate and more of the radioactivity was respired in the CO than those fed the LCF diets, 50 cf 13%, respectively. Moreover, the amount of radioactivity in the particulate organic matter in the metabolic chamber (predominantly of fecal origin) was low with MCF diets but significantly higher than for the LCF diets. However, increasing the amount of lipid in the diet from 15 to 30% did not significantly affect lipid oxidation. These results suggest that juvenile humpback grouper, and most likely other grouper species, do not utilise high dietary levels of lipid for energy but do efficiently digest, absorb and store the high levels.",

Daily requirements for energy and growth were quantified as the sum of the requirements for maintenance and growth for fish ranging in size from 1 to 1600 g: Requirement = a \u00d7 BW(kg) b + c \u00d7 growth; where BW(kg) b is metabolic weight of the fish, a is the maintenance requirement and c is the coefficient describing the efficiency of utilization of dietary energy or protein for growth. Metabolic rate was found to depend mostly on fish size over a water temperature range of 20 to 27\u00b0C and was proportional to the metabolic body weight in the form of a \u00d7 BW(kg) b The exponent b of the metabolic body weight was determined from starvation experiments to be 0.79-0.80 for fish ranging in size from 1 to 400 g. (Lupatsch et al., 2003) . From a series of comparative slaughter growth experiments (Lupatsch and Kissil, 2005) , they determined the efficiencies of digestible energy gain to be 0.66 while for digestible protein gain it was 0.54. Taken together, they were able to calculate the daily amounts of digestible protein and digestible energy that had to be provided in the diet to optimise growth of the fish. By calculating the daily voluntary feed intake of the fish at a particular size, they derived recommended dietary protein and energy/lipid specifications for white grouper growing from 2 to 750 g (Table 2) . Table 3 provides a collation of the aforementioned studies showing the dietary protein, lipid and derived protein to energy (P:E) ratio that Table 2 Recommended diet formulations to optimise growth of white grouper (E. aeneus) and the expected performance to be achieved during a growing period up to 750 g (after Lupatsch and Kissil, 2005) .",

However, low to moderate amounts of digestible carbohydrate in the diet can be a source of energy and assist in sparing protein from oxidative energy pathways and providing frequent small meals per day may also improve the fish's ability to more effectively utilise the absorbed glucose (Shiau, 1997; Moon, 2001) .",

Shiau and Lin (2002) fed two isoenergetic diets with either glucose or starch as carbohydrate sources to E. malabaricus juveniles of~5 g start weight for 8 weeks. Each carbohydrate source was included at 14.4% in a high fish meal (73% inclusion) semi-purified diet formulation. Weight gain and most other productivity measures were significantly better for fish fed the starch than the glucose diets. Usman et al. (2004) compared four carbohydrate sourcesglucose, sucrose, dextrin or starchwhen each was included in a fish meal based pelleted dry diet at a 20% inclusion level and fed twice daily to satiation to juvenile C. altivelis grouper of~8 g starting weight for 6-weeks. Growth rate, feed efficiency, protein retention and lipid retention of the fish were significantly better with the glucose diet followed by the dextrin and starch diets which were not significantly different from each other but significantly better than the sucrose diet. All fish survived irrespective of the dietary treatment. At the end of the 6-week experiment, blood samples were taken to measure the pattern of glucose uptake from the different carbohydrate sources. Fish fed the glucose diet had the most rapid and highest concentration of glucose at 3 h post-feeding compared to each of the other carbohydrate sources which peaked at 6 h and thereafter plasma glucose levels fell steadily throughout the h period and at the same rate as for the glucose diet. The apparent digestibility of nitrogen free extract was significantly higher with the glucose and starch diets (96.6 and 96.3%, respectively) and lowest for the dextrin and sucrose diets (87.7 and 82.8%, respectively); protein and lipid digestibility of the diets were similar for all diets. The extent to which dietary dextrin was utilised by humpback groupers C. altivelis was examined in more detail by Suwirya et al. (2004b) . Isonitrogenous diets containing graded inclusions of dextrin at 7% increments between 0 and 28% were fed twice daily to satiation to juveniles of 8 g starting weight for 9-weeks. Weight gain and feed efficiency of the fish improved curvilinearly as the amount of dextrin in the diet increased with asymptotic maximum responses at 18 and 21% dextrin, respectively. Liver and muscle glycogen and lipid concentrations increased more or less linearly with increasing dietary dextrin. These studies indicate that humpback groupers can efficiently utilise moderate levels (up to 20%) of readily digestible dietary carbohydrate but differences were shown to occur between carbohydrate sources with glucose and dextrin being better utilised than starch.",

Assuming a dietary total DHA + EPA content of 1.0% as being adequate, and using purified oil sources, Wu et al. (2002) varied the ratio of DHA and EPA from 3.15:1 to 0.24:1, respectively, across seven diets. These diets, together with a reference and a control diet, were fed to fingerlings of 11.5 g starting weight for 12 weeks. No signs of essential fatty acid deficiency were observed in any of the fish and survival did not differ between treatments. The best weight gain occurred in fish fed the DHA:EPA ratio diet of 2.96:1; diets with higher or lower DHA:EPA ratios resulted in poorer weight gains, while the worst performance (about 50% of that of the best diet) occurred on the 0.24:1 diet. The subsequent report (Wu et al., 2003) used samples obtained from the earlier study to examine the effects of dietary DHA:EPA ratios on cellular immune response. Significant positive correlations were found between leucocyte phagocytic or respiratory burst activities and concentrations of DHA in fish liver and muscle tissues. Based on the results of these studies, the authors concluded that dietary DHA was more effective than EPA in supporting weight gain and immunocompetence in groupers but no specific optimal ratio was recommended.",

More recent work has suggested a much higher requirement for dietary vitamin C. Shiau (2004, 2005c) examined productivity and immune responses of E. malabaricus when provided with diets containing various types of heat-stable vitamin C. In the 2004 study, the efficacy of L-ascorbyl-2-monophosphate-Mg (A2SMg) and L-ascorbyl-2-monophosphate-Na (A2SNa) as vitamin C sources were compared in an 8week feeding experiment with fish of~3 g starting weight. Each vitamin C source was supplemented in a semi-purified basal diet at inclusion levels of 0, 20, 50, 80, 150, 250 and 400 mg/kg. Supplementing with either A2SNa or A2SMg resulted in significantly better weight gain, feed efficiency and survival than the non-supplemented basal diet while liver ascorbate concentrations increased with increasing supplementation rate. Broken-line regression analysis of weight gain showed an optimum response to vitamin C supplementation at an A2SMg inclusion level of~50 mg/kg (equivalent to~18 mg/kg of ascorbic acid) and an A2SNa inclusion level of~42 mg/kg (equivalent to~8 mg/kg of ascorbic acid). Immune response indicators such as haemolytic complement activity and lysozyme activity were higher in fish supplemented with high levels of vitamin C, \u2265250 mg/kg of either A2SMg or A2SNa. It was concluded that A2SMg was only about 46% as effective in meeting the fish's vitamin C requirements as A2SNa. In the study (Lin and Shiau, 2005c) , L-ascorbyl-2 sulphate (A2S) and L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (A2P) were compared when each was supplemented at the same dietary inclusion levels as in the 2004 study and fed to fish of~7 g starting weight in an 8-week experiment. Fish fed 80 mg/kg or more of A2S (equivalent to an ascorbic acid level of \u226528 mg/kg) or 20 mg/kg or more of A2P (equivalent to an ascorbic acid level of \u22654 mg/kg) had significantly greater weight gains than fish fed the non-supplemented basal diet. Broken-line regression analysis of the weight gain response indicated an optimal vitamin C requirement of about mg/kg of A2S (equivalent to~46 mg/kg of ascorbic acid) or 90 mg/kg of A2P (equivalent to~18 mg/kg of ascorbic acid). A significantly higher lysozyme activity response was observed with fish fed the two highest vitamin C supplements. Based on weight gain response, it was concluded that A2S was only 39% as effective as A2P in meeting the vitamin C requirements of the fish. These studies indicate that the form of vitamin C used to supplement the diet is a critical factor in determining the appropriate level of supplementation. For A2S and A2P, dietary supplementation rates of 40-50 mg/kg appear to be sufficient under low stress culture conditions but rates 4-fold higher may be necessary to maximise immunocompetence. With A2S and A2P effective supplementation rates need to be 90-130 mg/kg under good culture conditions and 2-fold higher when culture conditions are sub-optimal. An interesting study was carried out by Laining et al. (2004) . They examined the efficacy of supplementing an experimental pelleted dry diet based on fish meal with a commercial vitamin premix in which vitamin C was provided as ascorbic acid or four incremental supplemental levels of vitamin C (as L-ascorbyl-2-monophosphate-Na-Ca (APNa)) over a range of 0 to 150 mg/kg. These diets were fed to juvenile humpback grouper (C. altivelis) of 5-7 g starting weight in an 8-week seacage experiment. Fish survival increased significantly with APNa supplementation: 75% for the non-supplemented diet and 85, 86.7 and 95% with 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg supplements, respectively. Fish weight gain more than doubled and FCR improved directly with increasing APNa supplementation while the fish fed the basal diet supplemented with the commercial vitamin premix resulted in all performance traits almost identical to that of the non-supplemented basal diet. Hepatic ascorbic acid concentration decreased from pre-treatment levels of 12.3 \u00b5g/g to 4.2 and 6.1 \u00b5g/g for the non-supplemented and commercial vitamin premix supplemented diets, respectively but increased to 26.1, 47.6 and 94.2 \u00b5g/g with increasing APNa supplementation. Clearly under semi-commercial growing conditions where water quality may not be ideal and other stressors operate, high levels of a heat-stable source of vitamin C may improve immunocompetence of the fish and improved fish performance.",

Increasing the dietary calcium to phosphorus ratio so that the Ca:P supplementation ratio was 18:6 g/kg respectively, depressed weight gain and feed efficiency. Fish fed diets without phosphorus supplementation had very soft vertebrae and vertebral malformations were also more abundant in the fish. Similarly the concentration of ash, calcium and phosphorus in the scales, vertebrae and opercula of the fish were significantly lower in fish fed diets without phosphorus supplementation. In the absence of phosphorus supplementation, calcium supplementation had no effect on calcium or phosphorus content of the scales and vertebrae. However, when diets were supplemented with 6 g/kg phosphorus, scale but not vertebrae mineralization was decreased with high calcium supplementation (12 or 18 g/kg).

Weight gain was highest in fish fed diets supplemented with 100 mg/kg iron, intermediate with other levels of supplementation and lowest for the zero supplemented basal diet. There was some indication that feed efficiency was depressed at the highest iron supplementation (250 g/kg). Haematological traits were unaffected by the level of iron supplementation. The authors recommended a dietary iron supplementation of 100 mg/kg diet to be optimal. In a similar approach, Lin et al. (2008) examined the dietary copper requirements of juvenile (~13 g start weight) E. malabaricus by feeding a semi-purified basal diet (containing 0.11 mg/kg copper) enriched with eight levels of copper (as CuSO ), resulting in dietary copper levels of 0.11, 1.66, 2.41, 4.37, 6.56, 8.97, 11.03 and 20.05 mg/kg). In the 8-week comparative slaughter experiment, weight gain and feed efficiency responses followed a curvilinear pattern with the best response occurring in fish fed diets containing copper levels of 4.37 and 6.56 mg/kg. Indicators of copper adequacy in the liver (copper concentration, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and copper zinc superoxide dismutase) and plasma (ceruloplasmin activities) all were optimized with a dietary copper content of 4-6 g/kg, similar to that for weight gain and feed efficiency. The dietary selenium requirement of E. malabaricus was examined by Lin and Shiau (2005b) . They supplemented a semi-purified basal diet containing 0.21 mg/kg of selenium with selenomethionine to provide six supplemental levels up to 5 mg/kg in one experiment and up to 4 mg/kg in a second experiment. These diets were fed to juveniles of~12 g starting weight for an 8-week growth assay experiment. In both experiments, fish survival was unaffected by selenium supplementation but weight gain and feed efficiency improved as the total dietary selenium content increased up to 0.77-0.79 mg/kg whereupon higher levels tended to depress fish performance. Hepatic selenium concentration increased linearly with selenium supplementation while hepatic glutathione peroxidise and glutathione reductase activities increased and decreased respectively across the range of selenium supplementation. Linear regression analysis of the relationship between dietary selenium and whole body selenium retention indicated an optimal dietary selenium level of 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg, similar to the optimal weight gain response.",

The approach used was similar in each study: a low fish meal plus soybean protein concentrate basal diet containing a mixture of crystalline amino acids that together provided 20% of the formulation was replaced in part with graded amounts of the essential amino acid under evaluation. In the methionine study (Luo et al., 2005c) , an additional control diet based entirely on fish meal as the dietary protein source was included in the treatment array and dietary cystine level was held constant across all supplemented diets. Within each experiment, all diets were isonitrogenous (~48-52% crude protein) and isolipid (~10%) and otherwise were identical in formulation. Starting weight of the fish across all experiments was 13 to 16 g and each experiment lasted for 8-weeks. Based on broken-line regression analysis of weight gain (or SGR) against dietary supplemented amino acid level, the dietary specification that optimized growth was determined to be 1.31% for L-methionine (in the presence of 0.26% L-cystine from intact protein), 2.83% for L-lysine and 2.73% for arginine. Other performance criteria (e.g. FCR, PER and plasma amino acid concentration) supported these suggested optima. Interestingly, weight gain of the fish fed the intact protein control diet in the methionine study (Luo et al., 2005c) was significantly better than each of the crystalline amino acid-supplemented diets. Moreover, weight gain of fish on this diet was numerically higher (19 to 31%) than that of fish on the best crystalline amino acid-supplemented diet in each of the three amino acid studies. This brings into question the correctness of the derived optimal dietary amino acid specification and the role that such a high inclusion of crystalline amino acids in the diet (20%) may have had on the fish's response. As noted by the authors (Luo et al., 2007) , crystalline amino acids are likely to be utilized at a lower efficiency than amino acids derived from intact protein because a more rapid absorption of the crystalline amino acids results in an amino acid imbalance in the tissues. In turn, this may divert more amino acids away from anabolic to catabolic processes. This has been clearly demonstrated by Williams et al. (2001) with Asian seabass, Lates calcarifer. In that work, a series of diets was formulated to contain the same total amount of essential amino acids but provided entirely from intact protein or mostly from crystalline amino acids. Fish fed the crystalline amino acid diets produced markedly inferior performance than those fed the intact protein series and this was more noticeable when the dietary protein content was sub-optimal. However, until more studies are done on the essential amino acid requirements of groupers, the findings of Luo et al. (2005c Luo et al. ( , 2006b Luo et al. ( , 2007 will serve as a useful guide.",

The situation with fish oil is even more critical with aquaculture estimated to consume 87% of global production in 2003 (Shepherd et al., 2005) . Increased production of fish meal and fish oil seems most unlikely as the capture fishery is already fully exploited.

Juvenile E. coioides of~2 g starting weight were fed twice daily to near satiety for 60 days. Although fish fed the zero replacement diet produced the highest specific growth rate (SGR; 1.14%/day), replacement of up to 40% of the fish meal protein was not significantly worse (SGR from 1.07 to 1.11%/day) but higher replacements brought about reduced growth and poorer feed conversion in the fish. The 2002 study examined the suitability of a 4:1 mixture of meat meal and blood meal to partially or wholly replace Chilean fish meal. Eight isonitrogenous diets comprising a serial replacement of fish meal protein at 10% increments from 0 to 40% and 20% increments from 60 to 100% were fed twice daily at near satiety to juvenile E. coioides of~6 g starting weight for 60 days, Compared to the zero replacement diet, growth rate and feed efficiency of the fish deteriorated only when the replacement rate was 80% or higher. Thus animal by-product meals could be used efficiently to replace from 40 to 80% of the fish meal protein in the diet of juvenile E. coioides.",

                "text": "Shrimp head meal was examined by Rachmansyah et al. (2004) as a replacement for fish meal protein in diets for juvenile humpback grouper C. altivelis. They fed five isonitrogenous diets that provided a serial replacement of fish meal protein with shrimp head meal at 10% increments from 0 to 40%. Fish commenced the experiment at~16 g and were cultured in seacages for 60 days. Increasing the replacement of fish meal beyond 10% brought about a marked and progressive decline in growth rate and feed efficiency of the fish. In other studies with humpback grouper, Shapawi et al. (2007) , two types of poultry byproduct meals, a local Malaysian feed grade product which was used to replace 50, 75 or 100% of Danish fish meal and an imported pet food grade product, which was used to replace 75 or 100% of the fish meal. The six isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were fed twice daily at near satiety to juveniles of~12 g starting weight for 8 weeks. Fish fed the pet grade poultry by-product meal grew and used the feed as efficiently as those fed the zero replacement control diet. However, the performance of fish fed the Malaysian feed grade meal at the 100% replacement rate was markedly inferior to all other diets. The superiority of the pet food grade product was attributed by the authors to its better essential amino acid profile, especially lysine and methionine, and/or its significantly higher protein digestibility. The efficacy of various vegetable oils to replace fish oil in fish meal-based isonitrogenous (59% crude protein) and isolipidic (10% crude fat) diets for juvenile humpback grouper has recently been reported by Shapawi et al. (2008) . Each of the five lipid sourcescod liver oil, crude palm oil, refined and bleached palm olein, soybean oil and canola oilwere incorporated into the otherwise isoingredient diets at 5% and fed twice daily at near satiety to juveniles of 11 g starting weight for 8-weeks. There were no significant differences between any of the diets in growth rate, feed efficiency, protein utilisation or whole body proximate composition of the fish. However, replacement of the cod liver oil with the vegetable sources produced very significant changes in the fatty acid composition of the whole body and lipid with the n\u22123:n\u22126 ratio decreasing from 3:1 to 0.5-0.6:1, respectively. The authors concluded that vegetable oil could completely replace supplemental fish oil in fish meal based diets for humpback groupers without compromising growth or feed utilisation efficiency.",

Stocking density is very much system-dependent but as a general guide, should not exceed a seacage fish biomass of about 10 to 12 kg/ m 3 . Higher stocking rates, while producing more fish biomass, invariably result in lower individual growth rates, greater size variation at harvest and lower survival rates. Feeding to satiety two or three times daily for juveniles of b20 g, and decreasing to once daily for fish above 200 g, is a useful feeding guide to produce good grouper growth rates while minimizing feed wastage. As better and more economical manufactured feeds become available for groupers, the feeding of fishery bycatch will be phased out with positive environmental and fish productivity benefits.",

There is some evidence that the optimal P:E specification falls from~30 g CP:1 MJ GE for fish of b15 g to~21 g CP:1 MJ GE for market size fish of 500-750 g. The essential fatty acid requirements should be satisfied with a dietary n\u22123 HUFA content of at least 1% and ideally the DHA content should be not less than 0.75% to maximise the fish's tolerance to sub-optimal culture conditions. Providing adequate amounts of vitamin C (at least 50 mg/kg ascorbic acid equivalent supplied as a heat-stable product) in heat-processed manufactured feeds will also improve the fish's ability to withstand stressful culture conditions. There is insufficient information available to make firm recommendations on requirements for other micronutrients and more research is needed to determine requirements for essential amino acids.",

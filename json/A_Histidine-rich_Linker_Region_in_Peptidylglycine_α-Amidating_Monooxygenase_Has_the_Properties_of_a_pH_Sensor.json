Results: A pH-sensitive His cluster in the amidating enzyme is essential for its trafficking. Conclusion: Lacking this conserved His cluster, proteolytic maturation and generation of a soluble cytosolic fragment of amidating enzyme fail to occur, disrupting secretion and nuclear signaling. Significance: The storage and regulated secretion of peptides requires intraluminal signaling. Decreasing luminal pH is thought to play a role in the entry of newly synthesized and endocytosed membrane proteins into secretory granules. The two catalytic domains of peptidylglycine \u2423-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a type I integral membrane protein, catalyze the sequential reactions that convert peptidyl-Gly substrates into amidated products. We explored the hypothesis that a conserved His-rich cluster (His-Gly-His-His) in the linker region connecting its two catalytic domains senses pH and affects PAM trafficking by mutating these His residues to Ala (Ala-Gly-Ala-Ala; H3A). Purified recombinant wild-type and H3A linker peptides were examined using circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence; mutation of the His cluster largely eliminated its pH sensitivity. An enzymatically active PAM protein with the same mutations (PAM-1/H3A) was expressed in HEK293 cells and AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells. Metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation revealed more rapid loss of newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A than PAM-1; although release of newly synthesized monofunctional PHM/ H3A was increased, release of soluble bifunctional PAM/H3A, a product of the endocytic pathway, was decreased. Surface biotinylation revealed rapid loss of PAM-1/H3A, with no detectable return of the mutant protein to secretory granules. Consistent with its altered endocytic trafficking, little PAM-1/H3A was subjected to regulated intramembrane proteolysis followed by release of a small nuclear-targeted cytosolic fragment. AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A adopted the morphology of wildtype AtT-20 cells; secretory products no longer accumulated in the trans-Golgi network and secretory granule exocytosis was more responsive to secretagogue.",

In neurons and endocrine cells that store peptides for regulated secretion, soluble cargo, and essential membrane proteins must be targeted to secretory granules. The post-translational modifications and sorting of prohormones are initiated in the dilated extensions of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 2 and continue as immature secretory granules are converted into mature secretory granules and transported to their sites of release (1, 2) . Intraluminal pH, which becomes increasingly acidic as proteins move from the Golgi (pH 6.7) into mature secretory granules (pH 5.2), is a key factor governing interactions among soluble cargo and granule membrane proteins and lipids (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) .",

More than half of the peptide products require an essential \u2423-amidation reaction at their C terminus to make them biologically active. This reaction is catalyzed only by peptidylglycine \u2423-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a bifunctional type I membrane protein ( Fig. 1A) (8, 9) . PAM catalyzes the \u2423-hydroxylation of Gly-extended peptides through its hydroxylation domain (PHM) and subsequently catalyzes \u2423-amidation through its lyase domain (PAL). PHM, PAL, and intact PAM have acidic pH optima, as do other enzymes that function in the lumen of the secretory granule (7, 10 -13) . The major splice variant, PAM-1, is subject to cleavage by prohormone convertases, generating soluble PHM (sPHM) and membrane PAL ( Fig. 1A) . Following granule exocytosis, PAM-1 that is deposited on the cell surface is retrieved by endocytosis and either recycled or degraded (14 -16) . During its endocytic trafficking, the luminal domain of PAM is again exposed to environments of descending pH. Endocytosed PAM-1 is subject to luminal cleavages that generate soluble PAM (sPAM) and intramembrane proteolysis that generates a soluble, cytosolic fragment of PAM (sf-CD) (Fig. 1A) .",

In addition to providing a site for controlled endoproteolytic cleavage of PAM-1, exon 16 is subjected to O-glycosylation and this region plays an important role in the sorting, trafficking, and turnover of PAM (16) . CLUSTALW analysis of evolutionarily divergent PAM proteins (31) identified a conserved His cluster in bifunctional PAM proteins from mammals and mollusks; no His cluster was found in Danio rerio, Acropora, Schistosoma, or Chlamydomonas PAM or in monofunctional Drosophila PHM (Fig. 1B) .

This His cluster is included in the final exon (rat exon 13; exon 14 is included only in a rare splice variant) encoding PHMcc and is followed by a poorly conserved, protease-sensitive region encoded by a short exon present in each of the major splice variants of PAM (rat exon 15). The non-catalytic linker region between PHM and PAL can end at exon 15, as in PAM-2, or can include a 315-nt exon (rat exon 16), as in PAM-1 (Fig. 1, A and B) (42) . Exon 16 plays an important role in PAM-1 trafficking and in the ability of PAM-1 to participate in transmembrane signaling (43) . To test the hypothesis that these His residues serve as a pH sensor, all three were mutated to Ala. The effects of this change were first evaluated in the context of the linker region alone; purified GST fusion proteins encoding the wild-type linker (WT linker) and the mutated linker (H3A linker) were cleaved and ion exchange chromatography was used to purify both proteins (Fig. 1C) .",

Although the same major products, sPHM and membrane PAL, were detected, sPHM accounted for a smaller percentage of the total PAM protein in PAM-1/H3A cells than in PAM-1 cells (Fig. 3E) ; because the cleavage generating sPHM occurs in exon 16, sPHM contains the His cluster, whereas membrane PAL does not. The amount of stored sPHM reflects the rate at which it is synthesized versus the rate at which it is secreted or degraded. To assess secretion, both cell extracts and spent media were analyzed (Fig. 3F) ; sPHM, which is produced only in the regulated secretory pathway, and sPAM, which is produced primarily in the endocytic pathway, were the major PHM proteins identified in spent media from both cell lines (39) . In 60 min, PAM-1/H3A cells secreted 12-18% of their cell content of PHM, whereas PAM-1 cells secreted only 6 -9% of their cell content of PHM under basal (not stimulated) conditions ( Fig. 3G ). Increased secretion of sPHM by PAM-1/H3A cells would contribute to their decreased cell content of sPHM.",

Based on previous antibody uptake and surface biotinylation studies, PAM-1 that reaches the plasma membrane is rapidly internalized; whether the internalized PAM-1 protein is recycled or degraded is governed by signals in its cytosolic domain (54 -56) .

B, total recovery was calculated by taking 120-kDa PAM present after the pulse as 100%. C, the turnover rate of freshly made PAM-1 was calculated by obtaining the ratio of sPHM (cell \u03e9 mdm) at each chase time to the amount of labeled PAM-1 after the pulse, adjusting for the number of methionine residues in each domain of PAM, and using lighter exposures in the linear range for quantification; data from three experiments were averaged. D, secretion of newly synthesized sPHM was calculated with reference to the total amount of sPHM present at that time (cells plus medium).

The same protocol was used to examine the internalization of PAM\u2150antibody complexes by PAM-1/H3A AtT-20 cells. Despite the fact that the percentage of PAM-1 and PAM-1/H3A on the cell surface at steady state is identical (Fig. 5, A and B) , internalization of PAM\u2150antibody complexes was decreased dramatically in PAM-1/H3A cells. After internalization for 20 min of the PAM\u2150antibody complexes, the multivesicular bodies of PAM-1 cells contained more than four times as many gold particles as the multivesicular bodies of PAM-1/H3A cells (905 gold particles in 73 multivesicular bodies in PAM-1 cells versus 202 gold particles in 73 multivesicular bodies in PAM-1/H3A cells). The multivesicular bodies accumulating PAM antibody in the PAM-1/H3A cells had a smaller transection diameter than seen in PAM-1 cells (310 \u03ee 9 nm for PAM-1 cells to 271 \u03ee 7 nm for PAM-1/H3A cells (p \u03fd 0.005)). Despite these changes, trafficking of the PAM\u2150antibody complexes that reached the multivesicular bodies into intraluminal vesicles was not altered in PAM-1/H3A cells (Fig. 7C) .",

Although the diminished levels of PAM\u2150antibody complex observed in PAM-1/H3A cells correlate well with the rapid loss of the biotinylated PAM-1/H3A and biotinylated membrane PAL/H3A, the trafficking steps involved in their rapid disappearance are unclear. In both AtT-20 cells and primary rat pituitary cells, sf-CD has been shown to enter the nucleus (16, 39) , where it is thought to alter gene expression, contributing to alterations in cytoskeletal organization and control of the regulated secretory pathway attributed to expression of PAM-1.

Quantification of cell area and cell elongation (L/W ratio) revealed no change in cell area, but a striking decrease in L/W ratio only in PAM-1 AtT-20 cells (Fig. 8B) . Consistent with the diminished ability of PAM-1 AtT-20 cells to engage in regulated secretion of POMC products, transmission EM studies previously revealed an accumulation of secretory protein in the TGN area (Fig. 8C, left) ; the black arrows mark a cisternal structure full of dense material previously shown to include PAM and POMC products (56) . Similar analysis of AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A revealed a normal Golgi structure with its trans-most cisternae free of accumulated secretory products.

In contrast, ACTH accumulated in the Golgi region of AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1. In AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A, ACTH accumulated in punctate structures located at the tips of cellular processes, with little ACTH signal in the Golgi region (Fig. 9A, right) .

A clear role for the PAM-1 His cluster in responding to luminal pH is supported by the ability of both NH 4 Cl/methylamine and concanamycin treatment to diminish sPHM levels in PAM-1, but not in PAM-1/H3A, cells (Fig. 6C) . The V-ATPase acts as a proton pump and as a pH sensor, relay-ing luminal pH information to cytosolic interactors (17, 18, 37, 49, 59) . The interaction of the V-ATPase with Arf6 and ARNO depends on luminal acidification and is important for budding and endosome-derived carrier-vesicle formation (19) . The increased accumulation of sPAM in concanamycin, but not in NH 4 Cl/methylamine, treated PAM-1 cells indicates that this response is not solely due to altered luminal pH; concanamycin was without effect on sPAM levels in PAM-1/H3A cells, perhaps because internalized PAM-1/H3A enters a degradative compartment instead of entering multivesicular bodies (Fig. 6,  A and B) . PAM-1/H3A cells secreted sPHM more quickly than PAM-1 cells, but sPHM secretion by both cell lines was decreased following prolonged exposure to NH 4 Cl/methylamine or concanamycin (Fig. 6D) ; this result indicates that additional regions of PAM-1 contribute to its pH sensitivity.",

Newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A is more likely to undergo degradation and soluble PHM/H3A is more likely to undergo basal secretion. Earlier studies demonstrated that PAM-4, a natural splice variant that encodes a soluble PHM protein that includes the His cluster, is stored more efficiently in regulated secretory granules than PHMcc, which lacks the His cluster (32, 52) . The diminished ability of PHM/H3A to enter the regulated secretory pathway is also reflected in its increased basal secretion from PAM-1/H3A cells. As discussed below, the enhanced ability of secretagogues to stimulate secretion of the PHM/H3A that is stored in mature secretory granules reflects the inability of PAM-1/H3A to signal normally.",

Phosphorylation of multiple sites in the unstructured cytosolic domain of PAM governs the fate of internalized PAM-1 (38, 39) . After endocytosis, endoproteolytic cleavage of PAM-1 at a site close to its transmem-brane domain produces sPAM and an \u03f319-kDa C-terminal fragment. Both metabolic labeling and surface biotinylation revealed the almost total absence of sPAM/H3A in PAM-1/ H3A cells. Consistent with these biochemical measurements, immunoelectron microscopy revealed diminished levels of internalized PAM-1/H3A in multivesicular bodies and their intraluminal vesicles. Lacking access to its normal endocytic trafficking pathway, internalized PAM-1/H3A is rapidly degraded. The trafficking of PAM-1 through multivesicular bodies is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser 949 (38, 39) . Our data suggest that a conformational change triggered by the His cluster when internalized PAM-1 reaches an appropriately acidified endosome plays an essential role in its endocytic trafficking.",

Expression of similar levels of PAM-1/H3A does not alter POMC processing, secretagogue responsiveness, or cytoskeletal organization. These differences could be a direct reflection of the altered properties of PAM-1/H3A or an indirect effect of the inability of PAM-1/ H3A to traffic normally, generate sf-CD, and alter gene expression ( Fig. 10E) .",

The inability of low luminal pH to alter the conformation of the cytosolic domain of PAM-1/H3A as it traverses specific subcellular locations could alter its ability to interact with essential cytosolic proteins like Kalirin and Uhmk1 (16) . Lacking the ability to traverse the endocytic pathway, PAM-1/H3A may never be exposed to the enzymes that allow PAM-1 to undergo the sequential cleavages needed to produce sf-CD and signal from the lumen to the cytosol. Using antisera specific to Ser(P) 937 and Thr(P) 946 , Ser(P) 949 , we were unable to detect changes in the steady state phosphorylation of PAM-1/H3A, but changes in phosphorylation at specific subcellular locations may occur.",

Although PAM-1/ K919R and PAM-1/F929A,F930A generate normal amounts of sf-CD, altered sf-CD phosphorylation would be expected to alter its ability to signal.

They are especially appropriate for organisms such as reef-building corals, for which dramatic declines in abundance are expected to worsen as anthropogenic climate change intensifies. Different corals differ substantially in physiological resilience to environmental stress, but the molecular mechanisms behind enhanced coral resilience remain unclear. Here, we compare transcriptome-wide gene expression (via RNA-Seq using Illumina sequencing) among conspecific thermally sensitive and thermally resilient corals to identify the molecular pathways contributing to coral resilience. Under simulated bleaching stress, sensitive and resilient corals change expression of hundreds of genes, but the resilient corals had higher expression under control conditions across 60 of these genes. These \"frontloaded\" transcripts were less up-regulated in resilient corals during heat stress and included thermal tolerance genes such as heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes, as well as a broad array of genes involved in apoptosis regulation, tumor suppression, innate immune response, and cell adhesion. We propose that constitutive frontloading enables an individual to maintain physiological resilience during frequently encountered environmental stress, an idea that has strong parallels in model systems such as yeast. Our study provides broad insight into the fundamental cellular processes responsible for enhanced stress tolerances that may enable some organisms to better persist into the future in an era of global climate change.",

In recent decades, the increasing frequency and severity of catastrophic coral bleaching (the dissociation of the coral host and its endosymbiotic algae Symbiodinium sp.) and bleaching-induced mortality (19) (20) (21) (22) has called into question whether corals have the capacity to acclimatize or adapt to global climate change (19, 20) . However, during mass coral bleaching events, survival of scattered coral colonies suggests that some groups of corals may possess inherent physiological tolerance to environmental stress (23, 24) . In addition, some high-temperature environments naturally retain healthy, growing coral populations (25) (26) (27) , and these corals can show elevated bleaching tolerances (e.g., refs. 18 and 28). These thermotolerant corals are among the most likely to cope with future climate change (sensu ref. 24 ) and, thus, represent an essential source of information about mechanisms underlying observed differences in coral physiological resilience (defined here as the capacity for an organism to experience relative environmental extremes and either resist cellular stress or rapidly recover from it; sensu ref. 29) .",

Alternatively, enhanced thermotolerance in other marine organisms (e.g., intertidal limpets, mussels, sea cucumbers, and amphipods) has been linked to higher constitutive expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps) (31) (32) (33) (34) . A growing number of studies find that the basic coral heat stress response involves a wide array of cellular processes, akin to the ESR in yeast (15) . These include induction of molecular chaperones (e.g., Hsps) and antioxidant enzymes but also involve Ca 2+ homeostasis disruption, cytoskeletal reorganization, and altered cell signaling and transcriptional regulation (e.g., refs.

The most variable of these pools reach \u226534\u00b0C during summer low tides and exhibits daily thermal fluctuations up to 6\u00b0C (26, 38) . Corals in the more variable pools show higher stress protein biomarker levels (39), more heattolerant Symbiodinium genotypes (27) , faster growth rates (38, 40) , and enhanced thermal tolerance (28) .

Replicate fragments of A. hyacinthus were sampled from the two populations (n = 6 individuals from the HV pool and n = 5 individuals from the MV pool). Samples of each colony were exposed to control/ ambient (mean, 29.2\u00b0C) and heated (mean, 32.9\u00b0C) temperatures in outdoor, flow-through aquaria for 72 h. We used the RNA-Seq method [Illumina platform (41) ] to measure gene expression differences between heated corals and corals under normal conditions from both pools (see Materials and Methods for further details). To control for tank and transplant effects, our experiments compared gene expression profiles of heated corals to genetically identical fragments exposed to normal temperature conditions. Overall, we identified hundreds of transcripts that respond to heat stress; however, heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive corals showed different patterns of gene expression. In particular, 60 of the genes up-regulated in response to heat stress in the sensitive coral population show a reduced response and a higher constitutive level of expression in tolerant corals (i.e., they are already up-regulated under control conditions in tolerant corals). We hypothesize that this transcriptional \"frontloading\" of stress-related genes may be a primary mechanism of thermal tolerance of high temperatures in reef-building corals. The largest numbers of differentially expressed genes were found in the comparisons of control and heated treatments [484, 247, and 159 for all, MV, and HV samples, respectively; 5% false-discovery rate (FDR) correction; Fig. 2 ]. Among these three comparisons, 574 unique contigs were identified comprising 404 unique Uniprot matches (Table S1 ). These genes had an average fold change of 3.58 (range, 1.73-14.02) for up-regulated and \u22123.61 (range, \u22122.01 to \u221227.24) for down-regulated contigs (Dataset S1A).",

Thermally resilient (HV) corals showed strikingly different transcriptomic response to heat exposure than more sensitive (MV) corals in several important ways. In HV corals, 81 genes reacted significantly to heat stress but did not significantly change in the MV corals (Fig.  2 ). Further inspection of the data showed that in MV corals, these 81 genes exhibited similar mean fold changes across MV and HV groups (Fig. S3 ). However, 64 of these 81 (79%) genes did not pass our standard deviation filter in the MV comparison because of high intercolony variability in MV corals. Thus, most genes that responded significantly in HV corals also responded in a similar fashion in MV corals, although significance was precluded by more variable responses among individuals. By contrast, we found 169 genes that reacted to heat stress in MV corals but not in HV corals. All but one of these 169 genes showed the same direction of change in HV and MV corals. In most of these cases (87%), however, lack of significant change in HV corals is a result of a reduced magnitude of response (i.e., lower fold change) of these genes in HV corals, not higher variance; all 169 genes passed the SD filter in the HV analysis. This pattern (Fig. 3) was apparent for down-regulated contigs (30 out of 33 showed greater decrease in MV corals; \u03c7 2 test; P < 2.2e \u221216 ), as well as up-regulated contigs (117 out of 136 genes showed greater increase in MV corals; \u03c7 2 test; P < 2.6e \u22126 ).",

Furthermore, reduced up-regulation in HV (measured as each gene's ratio of HV to MV fold change upon heat stress) is associated with higher constitutive expression in HV (measured as each gene's ratio of HV to MV control expression; Fig. 4 ). This relationship shows that genes reacting less during heat stress in HV corals may start off with a higher level of expression before heat stress. A similar pattern, although reversed, is true for down-regulated genes: most genes with reduced down-regulation in HV corals show lower expression levels of these genes in HV controls (21 of 30) . In other words, these data show that many up-regulated genes in the thermally sensitive MV corals are already expressed at higher levels in thermally tolerant HV corals and that many down-regulated genes are at lower constitutive levels (i.e., turned off under control conditions) in HV corals.",

The second category of genes that respond less to heat stress in HV corals may contain those that are less up-or down-regulated because of lower levels of intracellular stress in more heat-tolerant colonies. In yeast, reduced transcription during secondary stress was partly attributed to the increased availability of stress-reducing proteins generated during a primary stress (58) . In our dataset, these genes would show equal or lower expression in HV controls compared with MV controls and reduced reaction (i.e., lower fold change) during heat stress in tolerant corals (Fig. 4 , Lower Left, dark shading). Approximately 39% (57 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated) of the 169 reduced-reaction genes fall into this category. These include two genes with blast matches to small Hsps (contig214198 and contig182527 matching Hsp23/HSPB1 and Hsp16.2, respectively), one gene with a match to the cell-cell adhesion protein Sushi, von Willebrand factor (CSMD1; contig77844), and one gene with a match to the antioxidant Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD) (contig212121_178489; Dataset S3).

However, the molecular linkages between clade D and enhanced coral tolerance limits are almost completely unknown. In our experiments, all corals from the more thermally tolerant HV population hosted >94% clade D ( Fig. S4 and SI Materials and Methods), whereas MV corals were largely clade C (only two of five individuals hosting 19% and 23% clade D in control fragments; Fig. S4 ).

Our transcriptome data focus on conspecific corals with differing degrees of bleaching resilience and suggest that, in addition to the large number of genes involved in acute heat stress, coral resilience may involve the constitutive, frontloaded expression of several genes that are important in the reaction to environmental stress. Other genes that are different between resilient and sensitive corals may be stress indicators and reflect lower states of physiological stress in corals with cellular mechanics tuned for high temperatures. These concepts parallel emerging data from model systems, and yet represent further insight into what genomic mechanisms may be responsible for naturally occurring elevated resilience in organisms that are consistently exposed to variable environmental conditions. Additional research will be required to elucidate which frontloaded genes are absolutely required for enhanced thermotolerance, what long-term costs frontloading may have, and whether this phenomenon is acclimatory or adaptive.",

Small branchlets (\u223c2 cm 3 ) of A. hyacinthus were collected from 16 different coral colonies from two back reef pools on the south side of Ofu Island, American Samoa (14\u00b011\u2032S, 169\u00b036\u2032W). Ten colonies of A. hyacinthus were sampled from a larger MV pool, and six colonies were sampled from a smaller HV pool (pools 400 and 300, respectively; for temperature profiles, see ref. 28) . Replicate samples (n = 2) of the same colony were randomly placed in one of two experimental tanks per condition. The ambient/control condition ranged from 26.8-34.5\u00b0C (mean = 29.2\u00b0C, n = 2 tanks), whereas the heat stress condition was elevated by \u223c2.7\u00b0C over ambient conditions (27-37.6\u00b0C ; mean, 31.9\u00b0C; n = 2 tanks). Coral health was monitored every 6-12 h, and samples were taken at 1200 hours after 72 h of exposure to the experimental conditions. The 72-h time point was chosen based on our previous study: a 72-h exposure to elevated temperatures induced initial mortality in the MV samples, whereas HV samples remained alive and appeared resilient (figure 5 from ref. 28 ). All samples were preserved in RNAlater (Life Technologies) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until subsequent analysis.",

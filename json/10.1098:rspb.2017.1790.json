    "abstract": "Ecological damage from periodic environmental extremes is often repaired in resilient ecosystems, but the rate of return to a non-damaged state is critical. Measures of recovery of communities include biomass, productivity and diversity, while measures of recovery of individuals tend to focus on physiological conditions and the return to normal metabolic functioning. Transcriptomics offers a window into the entire physiology of the organism under stress and can represent a holistic view of organismal recovery. In this study, we track the recovery of seven colonies of Acropora hyacinthus following a natural bleaching event. We identified a large environmental stress response in the field that involved approximately 20% of the host transcriptome. The transcriptome remained largely perturbed for at least six months after temperatures had cooled and four months after symbiont populations had recovered. Moreover, a small set of genes did not recover to previous expression levels even 12 months after the event, about the time that normal growth rates resumed. This study is among the first to incorporate transcriptomics into a longitudinal dataset of recovery from environmental stress. The data demonstrate large and lasting effects on coral physiology long after environmental conditions return to normal and symbiont populations recover.",

This is often referred to as engineering resilience, measured as the rate of return to a predisturbance equilibrium [1] . If disturbance occurs at a rate greater than recovery, then communities can experience irreversible change. Understanding rates of recovery following disturbance is becoming increasingly critical as climate change begins to alter disturbance regimes. This is particularly true for habitat-forming foundation species, for which the resilience of the entire ecosystem is ultimately hinged upon.",

While severe cases of coral bleaching can result in wide-spread mortality and phase shifts [3] , during more moderate bleaching events individual coral colonies show a remarkable capacity to recover [4] . In order for this to occur, corals must rely on alternative forms of energy to account for the reduced levels of photosynthetically fixed carbon from their algal symbionts, which can decline by up to 90% in bleached colonies [5] . Corals that can increase heterotrophy maintain high levels of energy reserves across the bleaching period and have quick recovery trajectories [6, 7] . Most corals, however, rely on stored energy reserves to meet daily metabolic demands while bleached and experience significant declines in tissue biomass across the bleaching period [5] . Recovering lost energy reserves after symbiont populations recover can take months, and as a result, periods of bleaching are often followed by strong declines in metabolically-intensive processes such as calcification, growth, and reproduction [4, [8] [9] [10] .",

Our data indicate that the coral transcriptome can remain perturbed for up to 10 months after bleaching occurs and can have persistent effects on the physiology of an individual colony more than a year after bleaching. If bleaching events begin to occur annually in the coming decades, rates of disturbance may soon outpace the capacity of some important reef-building coral species to recover.",

We focused on A. hyacinthus because it is one of the dominant reef-building species in Ofu, has large amounts of genomic resources available [21, [27] [28] [29] , and is one of the few species that we had samples in hand that predated the bleaching event. Coral nubbins of approximately 2-4 cm in size were collected from colonies within 3 h of high-tide using garden clippers and preserved in RNAlater. All colonies occurred at depths of approximately 0.5-1.0 m and were within a 2500 m 2 area of back-reef. We measured growth rates for the seven colonies by combing field collected maximum length measurements with colony photographs to calculate total colony area for each sample date using IMAGEJ [30] . We used these data to calculate colony growth rates across the bleaching recovery period, presented as fraction of colony growth per month. We returned to each colony in April 2016 to collect final data points on growth and mortality. Growth rates across the recovery period were compared to pre-bleaching growth rates determined using a monthly average from growth data calculated over 6 years (2010-2016) as part of a larger growth study [31] .",

Transcriptional modules can represent distinct physiological units with individual functional enrichments that can dramatically simplify interpretations of the physiological stress response. For example, the response to experimental acute heat stress (3 h temperature ramp to 358C with a 1 h hold) in A. hyacinthus involves thousands of transcripts that can be summarized as the expression of 23 transcriptional modules, some of which are significantly correlated with bleaching outcome after heat stress and enriched for molecular functions including sequencespecific DNA binding, motor activity and extracellular matrix structure [27] . In addition, Ruiz-Jones & Palumbi [28] combined high-resolution transcriptomic and environmental profiling and identified an additional three transcriptional modules in A. hyacinthus that are upregulated during tidal heat pulses when extreme low tides cause temperatures to spike above 30.58C. These modules are significantly enriched for transcription factors and gene products associated with the unfolded protein response [28] . We used these transcriptional modules to analyse our field-collected bleaching recovery dataset. To do this, we first normalized our expression data with DESEQ2 v 1.6.3 [39] and matched the normalized matrix to a list of contigs comprising the three sub-bleaching field stress modules that respond to field stress experienced during extreme low tides [28] (modules RJ6, RJ9, RJ11) and the seven acute heat stress modules that correlate with bleaching outcome following experimental heat stress [27] (modules R1, R4, R10, R12, R14, R15, R17). We then used WGCNA [40] to calculate the expression of these 10 modules for each colony in our field-collected dataset across the bleaching recovery period. To determine whether these transcriptional modules also comprised co-regulated gene sets in our field-collected dataset, we used Pearson product-moment correlation tests of contig expression and corresponding module eigengene.",

This is consistent with the generalized pattern of bleaching recovery from past studies, where symbionts and chlorophyll-a recover first, followed by tissue biomass and energy reserves, and finally growth and reproduction [4, 5, 9, 10, [16] [17] [18] 42] . Bleaching recovery is primarily associated with energetics; corals that are capable of increasing heterotrophy maintain energy reserves throughout the bleaching recovery period and thus have a rapid recovery trajectory [6, 7] . Corals that cannot increase heterotrophy begin to consume stored energy reserves to meet basic metabolic demands, resulting in a significant decline in tissue biomass [5, 16, 43] . Recovering those lost energy reserves takes time and often lags well behind the recovery of symbiont and chlorophyll-a levels [5, 18, 44] . In this study we did not measure changes in energy reserves; however, the lag in transcriptome recovery we observed parallels previous observations that physiology recovers only slowly from bleaching. Where we could measure them, growth rates recovered after February 2016, suggesting that growth recovery quickly followed transcriptome recovery. Similarly, previous studies have shown skeletal extension rates to recover once tissue biomass is restored [4] .",

This finding contrasts a number of other studies that have identified symbiont type to play a key role in the bleaching recovery process [45] [46] [47] . In American Samoa, A. hyacinthus forms a flexible association with Symbiodinium clades C and D, with higher levels of the more thermally tolerant clade D occurring in high-temperature habitats [35] . However, these colonies do not shift symbiont clade when transplanted to alternate microhabitats [48] . In the current study, one colony (AH13) shifted to higher levels of clade D at the six month time point (figure 2; electronic supplementary material, table S5) but shifted back to pre-bleaching proportions by the 10 month time point in December. Photographs made of these times showed sediment intrusion and a wholesale die off of corals immediately surrounding AH13 after the February 2015 bleaching event. Inspection of genetic variants confirmed that samples in August 2015 were AH13. It is possible that the large changes in symbiont type in AH13 reflect microclimate-this colony is the shallowest, most shoreward of all the colonies in our study and showed the highest temperature levels (table 1) .",

Unlike the acute bleaching data, which show a decline in transcriptional changes within days, our data show that one portion of the environmental stress response intensified until at least the six month mark (figures 3 and 4). The environmental stress response in model organisms such as yeast, responds to a range of stressors, from heat stress to starvation, and is comprised of hundreds of genes that are common to a diverse range of environmental pressures, as well as a subset of genes unique to a particular environment [49] . Colonies in our current study initially bleached in February, so would have been surviving on reduced levels of photosynthetically fixed carbon for up to six months before symbiont populations fully returned by August 2015. As a result, colonies may have consumed large portions of their energy reserves during this period, and the environmental stress response we see at the six month time point in August 2015 may be associated with nutrient deprivation rather than a heat stress response. Past studies have shown that the recovery of lost energy reserves lags behind the recovery of symbiont populations [5, 16, 18, 42] , so we would expect the stress response to starvation to linger after symbiont densities recover until sufficient energy reserves were restored.",

In culture, cellulase treatments can successfully digest isolated Symbiodinium cell walls [55] . However, within coral cells, the fate of symbiont cell walls remains largely unknown. Multiple layers of membranous material can accumulate between the symbiosome membrane and the vegetative algal cell wall [53] , but it is unclear whether this is a possible nutrient source or alternatively a hindrance to symbiont replication. An interesting question that follows is whether corals increase the production of cellulase-like enzymes to digest any nutrient-rich structures in Symbiodinium prior to expulsion, or if host-produced cellulase functions in rapid proliferation of symbionts during recovery. Periods of nutrient deprivation in other coral genera have been shown to coincide with marked declines in symbiont densities and an increase in the intensity of algal cell degradation in the gastroderm of the coral [56] . If this observation is general, then rapid symbiont expulsion after acute bleaching might be a slightly different phenomenon than later expulsion during starvation. Furthermore, should these observations be repeated in other localities, species and bleaching events, then enzymatic assays of endoglucanase in seemingly recovered corals might be a practical assay of lingering negative effects of previous bleaching events.",

The predominant transcriptome response in our current study, involving up to 20% of the transcriptome, persisted up to six months after bleaching, and hundreds of genes remained upregulated for a year after bleaching. Gene expression patterns that linger and do not return to baseline expression following acute experimental heat stress comprise functional annotation clusters for the regulation of the immune system, apoptosis, transcription, and protein signalling [29] . Corals thriving in naturally extreme thermal environments frontload similar stress response genes as a mechanism to prepare an individual for frequently encountered stress [21] .

For these four colonies, declines in growth rates and visual bleaching score showed a strong and significant relationship (r 2 \u00bc 0.989, p \u00bc 0.004). In total, 69 689 086 reads from 35 cDNA libraries were mapped to a reference A. hyacinthus transcriptome consisting of 33 496 coral contigs [21]. On average, 1 991 117 (+144 581 s.e.) reads per sample were successfully mapped to 31 737 contigs, with 13 253 contigs represented by a mean read depth greater than five (electronic supplementary material, table S3). Clustering analyses based on 3946 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed that tissue samples collected on consecutive dates from AH25 actually comprised three distinct genotypes (electronic supplementary material,figure S1), indicating that tissue samples were mistakenly collected from a nearby colony on three of the five sampling dates. As a result, we excluded AH25 for any individual-level gene expression analyses.Symbiodinium cell densities had declined by 51% (+10% s.e.) in colonies two months after bleaching (figure 2). Cell densities rebounded back to pre-bleaching baseline levels at six months and remained stable over the remaining sample dates. An average of 158 reads per sample (range 22-626) mapped to the reference Symbiodinium sequence (cp23S). All colonies were associated predominantly with clade C (showing 0.75-0.95 proportion of clade C mapped reads) at all time points, except for a single colony (AH13) which showed 60% clade D six months after bleaching but over 90% clade C four months before and after this time point (figure 2; electronic supplementary material, table S4).

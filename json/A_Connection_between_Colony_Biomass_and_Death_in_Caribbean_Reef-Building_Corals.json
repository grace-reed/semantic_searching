To better understand how corals and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) respond to environmental change, tissue biomass and Symbiodinium density of seven coral species were measured on various reefs approximately every four months for up to thirteen years in the Upper Florida Keys, United States (1994-2007), eleven years in the Exuma Cays, Bahamas (1995-2006), and four years in Puerto Morelos, Mexico (2003-2007). For six out of seven coral species, tissue biomass correlated with Symbiodinium density. Within a particular coral species, tissue biomasses and Symbiodinium densities varied regionally according to the following trends: Mexico$Florida Keys$Bahamas. Average tissue biomasses and symbiont cell densities were generally higher in shallow habitats (1-4 m) compared to deeper-dwelling conspecifics (12-15 m). Most colonies that were sampled displayed seasonal fluctuations in biomass and endosymbiont density related to annual temperature variations. During the bleaching episodes of 1998 and 2005, five out of seven species that were exposed to unusually high temperatures exhibited significant decreases in symbiotic algae that, in certain cases, preceded further decreases in tissue biomass. Following bleaching, Montastraea spp. colonies with low relative biomass levels died, whereas colonies with higher biomass levels survived. Bleaching-or disease-associated mortality was also observed in Acropora cervicornis colonies; compared to A. palmata, all A. cervicornis colonies experienced low biomass values. Such patterns suggest that Montastraea spp. and possibly other coral species with relatively low biomass experience increased susceptibility to death following bleaching or other stressors than do conspecifics with higher tissue biomass levels.",

Currently, populations of reef-building corals are in global decline due to increased sea-surface temperatures associated with climate change [1] . The worldwide degradation of coral reefs has been further exacerbated at local and regional scales by an array of anthropogenic stressors, such as nutrient inputs, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, exotic species introductions, increased sedimentation and pollution [2, 3] . As a result of this ecological crisis, there is an urgent need to understand how acute and chronic stressors affect the physiological integrity of reef-building corals.",

Bleaching is defined as the loss of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium (a genetically diverse group that is commonly known as zooxanthellae) from the coral's tissue, but it may also include loss of pigments by the endosymbiont and/or the host [4] . Coral bleaching is often associated with El Ni\u00f1 o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and climate change [1] . Because reef-building corals receive energy from their Symbiodinium communities [5] , severe bleaching often results in coral colony death through starvation or disease [1, 6, 7] . For example, an intense ENSO event in 1997-1998 led to loss of approximately 16% of coral reefs globally, including corals in the Caribbean Sea [8] .",

In some cases, neighboring colonies of the same coral species were differentially affected by bleaching [10] . The factors underlying differential mortality of corals under seemingly identical conditions of depth and reef position remain poorly understood. It has been proposed that this response is due to a combination of genotypic and physiological variation among coral colonies [11] and/or their endosymbionts [12, 13] . One additional factor affecting postbleaching mortality is a colony's level of energy reserves, which is correlated with tissue biomass or ash-free dry weight (AFDW).",

Reef-building corals obtain energy from polytrophic sources, including photosynthetic endosymbionts, heterotrophic feeding, and absorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and this energy is allocated to metabolism, reproduction, skeletal growth (i.e., calcification), mucus production, tissue repair and defense, and production of new biomass (e.g., tissue growth and energy reserves) [14] [15] [16] . A colony's biomass level thus depends upon the equilibrium between various energetic sources vs. expenditures and is subject to dynamic change over time. Such change can be observed in the fluctuations of coral tissue biomass and Symbiodinium population density in response to seasonal variation in temperature and light, with both parameters reaching annual nadir during the hottest times of the year [17, 18] . Tissue biomass and Symbiodinium density are further depleted during mass bleaching events [18] , which jeopardize colony survival due to corals' reliance on energy reserves for sustenance during stress. If biomass reserves and energy inputs from autotrophic symbionts, heterotrophic feeding, and absorption are insufficient, then a colony may perish from starvation or due to secondary stressors (e.g., disease).",

Corals were collected from nine different reefs spanning three geographic regions from a time span of 3-13 years ( Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). Our goals were to 1) examine the relationship between tissue biomass and Symbiodinium density, 2) determine how these two parameters vary spatially (i.e., by region, habitat, and depth) and temporally (i.e., season), 3) assess changes in these two parameters following two bleaching events (1998 and 2005), and 4) determine the relationship between coral tissue biomass and colony mortality.",

For example, at shallow depths (1-4 m), corals from the Bahamas often had lower mean tissue biomass and/or Symbiodinium density values than conspecifics from other regions (Fig. 4 ). This pattern occurred in the endosymbiont cell densities for M. annularis (p values,0.0001), A. cervicornis (p,0.0001), and S. siderea (p = 0.039, two-sample t-test), as well as in both parameters for M. faveolata (p values,0.0001), A. palmata (p values#0.004, two-sample t-test), and P. astreoides (p values,0.0001) ( Fig. 4 , unless otherwise noted, regional and depth comparisons and hypotheses testing conducted via two-factor ANOVA and Tukey's honestly-significant-difference tests). By contrast, values for the tissue biomass and Symbiodinium density of shallow water corals in the Florida Keys were either intermediate to those of the Bahamas and Mexico (e.g., M. faveolata tissue biomass p values,0.001; M. annularis symbiont density p values,0.0001; P. astreoides tissue biomass, Florida vs. Mexico p = 0.004, Florida vs. the Bahamas p,0.001), statistically indistinguishable from those of the Bahamas (e.g., M. annularis, tissue biomass p = 0.827; S. siderea tissue biomass two sample t-test p = 0.465), or statistically indistinguishable from those of Mexico (e.g., M. faveolata Symbiodinium density p = 0.554; P. astreoides Symbiodinium density p = 0.258) ( Fig. 4) . Finally, shallow M. annularis, M. faveolata, and P. astreoides from Mexico had the highest mean tissue biomasses and/or symbiont densities relative to conspecifics from other regions (Fig. 4 , p values,0.0001 except M. faveolata Florida vs. Mexico symbiont density where p = 0.554 and P. astreoides Florida vs. Mexico where tissue biomass p = 0.004 and (Fig. 4) . Montastraea franksi was an exception to this pattern, having higher mean tissue biomass in the Bahamas relative to the Florida Keys (Fig. 4c , two sample t-test p,0.0001). Symbiodinium densities either did not differ significantly between regions (i.e., M. franksi two sample T-test p = 0.923) or were higher in Florida than in the Bahamas (i.e., for M. annularis p = 0.002, M. faveolata p = 0.003, and A. cervicornis p = 0.003; Fig. 4 ). Therefore, at greater depth, the typical regional tissue biomass patterns were Florida = Bahamas, with the exception of M. franksi. The generalized regional Symbiodinium density patterns were Florida$Bahamas.",

Both coral tissue biomass and endosymbiont cell density varied seasonally, with the highest values often occurring in the winter or spring and lowest values frequently occurring during the summer or fall (Fig. 5 ).

Variation among reefs reflected the differences between regions and depths explored above ( Fig. 4) , as well as differences between the specific sites sampled ( Fig. 5 ).

Deep-dwelling M. franksi exhibited significant tissue biomass variation among reefs, but not between seasons or in the interaction between reefs and seasons (Table S1, Fig. 5c ). The lack of significant seasonality stems from a combination of no seasonal change at certain sites and asynchronous seasonality among other sampled reefs. For M. franski Symbiodinium densities, significant variation occurred seasonally as well as in the interaction between reef and season, but not among reefs alone (Table S1 , Fig. 5c ). The second exception to the seasonality described above was in both the tissue biomass and Symbiodinium densities of A. cervicornis. Here, statistical analyses revealed significant variation between reefs, but no effect of season or of the interaction between season and reef (Table S1 ). As illustrated in Fig. 5d , the tissue biomass and symbiont densities of A. cervicornis generally remained constant and low relative to other species throughout the year. For A. palmata, significant variation was detected between reefs for both parameters and significant seasonality was detected in tissue biomass (Table S1 ). However, there was no significant seasonality in A. palmata Symbiodinium density or in the interaction between reef and season for either parameter (Table S1 ). This may have resulted from the asynchronous seasonality between reefs for A. palmata Symbiodinium density and the relatively low overall fluctuations in this coral (Fig 5e) . Finally, the tissue biomass of P. astreoides varied significantly among reefs and in the interaction between reef and season, but not significantly by season alone (Table S1 ). The lack of significant seasonal variation in P. astreoides biomass may result from seasonal highs occurring at different times of the year for each of the reefs sampled (i.e., asynchronous seasonality, Fig. 5f ). Beyond these three exceptions, tissue biomass and Symbiodinium Figure 2 . Species-specific values for tissue biomass versus Symbiodinium density from seven species of scleractinian corals. Biomass was measured by ash-free dry weight in mg tissue6cm 22 whereas Symbiodinium density was quantified as density fluctuated significantly across seasons for the sampled coral species (Table S1 ).",

Tissue biomass and Symbiodinium density often varied over both space and time, with a tendency towards the following generalized patterns: Mexico$Florida$Bahamas, shallow$deep, and winter/spring.summer/fall. The 1998 and 2005 bleaching events were characterized by reduced Symbiodinium densities, but not necessarily host tissue biomass, for many coral species.

One possible explanation for such correlations is that endosymbionts are an important component of overall tissue biomass. This possibility has not been explored in the published scientific literature and would make an important topic for future studies. However, data made available to us by S.C. Kempf provide insight into the contributions of Symbiodinium to tissue biomass. Kempf separated host and endosymbiont tissues in five symbiotic cnidarians from the Florida Keys and measured the ash free dry weight of isolated Symbiodinium cells (S.C. Kempf unpublished data). For M. annularis, that analysis resulted in tissue biomass values of 13164 pg6Symbiodinium cell 21 (S.C. Kempf . The designation 'N.D.'

Based on the cell densities recovered in our study and the cell biomass values measured by S.C. Kempf, we estimate that Symbiodinium cell biomass accounts for less than 5% of the M. annularis AFDW value. Assuming that a similar biomass of Symbiodinium cells occurs in other reef-building coral species, it appears that symbionts did not appreciably bias the measurement of host AFDW. This conclusion is further supported in many coral species by both the weak relationships between symbiont density and biomass and the immediate decreases in Symbiodinium densities seen during or just after bleaching events with a subsequent loss of tissue biomass delayed until the next sampling point. Nevertheless, it is possible that the relative contributions of Symbiodinium vary among different host and/or endosymbiont species and/or in space and time. Additional study is clearly needed to better document this relationship. Until such data are available, biological inferences about the correlations between symbiont density and overall biomass should be considered with caution.",

Host tissue biomass in corals such as M. faveolata and P. astreoides were greatest when endosymbiont densities were at their highest, despite the fact that Symbiodinium themselves comprise only a marginal portion of measured AFDW (see above). Thus, nutritional (or energetic) mutualisms between corals and symbiotic dinoflagellates likely drive the positive correlations between Symbiodinium densities and host tissue biomasses for most (i.e., six out of seven) species examined here. Presumably, coral species with a weak or uncorrelated biomass to Symbiodinium density relationship, such as A. cervicornis and S. siderea, either obtain a larger proportion of their energetic needs through alternative sources (i.e., heterotrophic feeding and/or absorption), harbor Symbiodinium populations whose net carbon translocation is uncoupled from cell density, allocate more of their energy to other biological requirements (e.g., calcification, mucus production, reproduction, etc.), or some combination of these scenarios.",

Individuals, populations, and species of coral living under various habitats or associating with different symbiont genotypes many differentially rely on photosynthesis, heterotrophy, and DOM absorption depending on their circumstances [24, 25] . In Hawaii, for instance, the coral Montipora capitata compensates for stress-related reductions in Symbiodinium density through increased feeding, whereas Porites compressa and P. lobata do not [26] . Physiological and morphological variation among Symbiodinium may partially explain the differences in AFDW and symbiont cell density among host species. Certain Symbiodinium lineages presumably transfer less photosynthate to their hosts than do others [27] , which may translate into different degrees of correlation between coral biomass and symbiont density among different coral species. Previous work confirms the presence of considerable genetic diversity of Symbiodinium among the colonies and species examined here [19, 20, 28] . More precise information about the physiological contributions of different Symbiodinium lineages is required to determine the degree of mutualism in various host-symbiont combinations.",

Tissue biomass and Symbiodinium densities can diminish as irradiance decreases; for instance, across a depth range [18] or with increased shading in underwater caves [29] . It is therefore possible that such differences might be evident in colonies living in high versus low latitudes. Puerto Morelos, Mexico is located at lower latitude than the other regions sampled resulting in more direct photosynthetically active radiation exposure and less seasonal variation. This increased photosynthetically active radiation and seasonal stability may explain the higher tissue biomass in M. annularis, M. faveolata and P. astreoides from Mexico, relative to other regions.",

Additionally, reefs of the Upper Florida Keys are proximate to large human populations, presumably leading to greater direct anthropogenic impacts (e.g., nutrient additions) relative to the more isolated reefs of Lee Stocking Island. Despite this, corals of the Exuma Cays recently experienced greater extremes of high temperature and bleached more often (e.g., in 2005 [19, 20] ) than colonies from the Upper Florida Keys. Greater bleaching-induced stress and the subsequent years of recovery may override latitudinal effects, resulting in reduced tissue biomass and Symbiodinium density in corals from the Bahamas relative to Floridian conspecifics (see discussion of bleaching below).",

Previous studies attributed this pattern to photoacclimation by Symbiodinium populations to attenuating light [18, 29] and this explanation is consistent with our data for M. faveolata. In contrast, M. annularis experienced depth-related differences in tissue biomass, but not Symbiodinium density. Furthermore, A. cervicornis showed either no difference in tissue biomass or Symbiodinium density among depths (in Florida), or an inverse relationship between these two parameters (in the Bahamas). These contrasting results suggest that additional factors contribute to bathymetric tissue biomass and symbiont density patterns. Compared to shallow habitats, deeper reefs are characterized by reduced light intensity, lower average temperature, and marked differences in currents and advective flow from deeper waters. Such physical patterns could drive differences in quantity and quality of zooplankton, detritus, and DOM that may also influence coral biomass. For example, certain corals increase heterotrophic intake with decreasing light intensity and increasing depth [24, 25] . Thus, biomass differences noted here are likely due, in part, to resource acquisition via autotrophy and heterotrophy, as many corals display a greater reliance on heterotrophically derived carbon and nitrogen in deeper waters [32, 33] . While differences in endosymbiont density, carbon translocation, and Symbiodinium genotype (mentioned below) are probable causes of the depthrelated patterns in tissue biomass, more detailed comparative analyses are necessary to further understand corals' carbon and nutrient budgets.",

High temperatures increase metabolic rate, which influences the depletion of lipid reserves, animal biomass, and skeletal growth [39] . Importantly, most Caribbean coral species reproduce by single annual broadcast spawning events in the late summer (i.e., Montastraea, Acropora, and S. siderea), while others brood and release mature larvae several times over the year (i.e., P. astreoides) [40] . Energetic demands of reproduction would further reduce lipids and overall biomass, thus contributing to the typical fall minima in coral tissue. Likewise, the more frequent reproductive effort and thermally tolerant symbioses of P. astreoides [13] may dampen seasonal biomass fluctuation in this species.",

Whereas bleaching was seen in the Florida Keys and Mexico in 1998, we were unable to sample most of these locations during the peak of the event, with the exception of ADM reef. Similarly, although bleaching was noted in 2005, the lack of symbiont loss in Montastraea spp. from Mexico in our samples is most likely due to the late sampling time (October), after symbiont populations began recovery. Thus, while many corals appeared pale, this may have been due to a substantial reduction in photosynthetic pigments per algal cell as the remaining symbionts were photoacclimating to the higher post-bleaching light field in hospite [41] . Clearly, annual symbiont loss, and greater decline during bleaching, plays a significant role in dictating resource partitioning in corals. Bleaching reduces the proportion of carbon translocated from Symbiodinium spp. to the host coral, and as a result, corals must consume stored energy reserves [42] [43] [44] . Our data also show that such losses in biomass do not always immediately coincide with losses of Symbiodinium, suggesting a possible time lag [18] . This was particularly apparent in Mexico, where sampling occurred after the 2005 event. For Montastraea spp., symbiont densities were in the process of recovery during sampling, whereas tissue biomass levels were experiencing significant declines.",

Similarly, Hoegh-Guldberg [1] proposed that thicker-tissue corals would be more resistant to bleaching due to increased photo-protective shading. These findings suggest the following hypotheses: 1) tissue biomass is indicative of overall coral colony health, 2) tissue biomass is predictive of colony survival probability following periods of stress, such as high-temperature induced bleaching, and 3) each species of coral has a biomass minimum, below which colonies are more susceptible to disease and starvation.",

In contrast, colonies of Montastraea spp. with higher biomasses survived (Fig. 7) . Similar observations were made for A. cervicornis, which exhibited low tissue biomass throughout the year at all locations sampled ( Fig. 5d ). At three reefs, A. cervicornis colonies died following either the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1 o or putative disease incidents. These colonies experienced prolonged periods of low tissue biomass prior to their death (Fig. 8) . While surviving A. cervicornis colonies exhibited slightly higher biomass values, all colonies experienced major reductions in the area of living coral tissue on their skeletons and many colonies died over the course of our sampling. Because all A. cervicornis colonies died or shrank substantially in tissue area (i.e., were dying), it was not possible to precisely estimate a minimum tissue threshold for this species. Based on comparisons to A. palmata, we estimated the minimum tissue threshold for A. cervicornis to be between 3.3 and 5.3 mg tissue6cm 22 . However, comparisons between Acropora spp. should be interpreted cautiously, as the biomass differences may result primarily from intrinsic properties of each species as opposed to dissimilarity in colony health.",

If this hypothesis is correct, tissue biomass represents a potentially useful indicator of the health of different corals. Field survey studies of mass bleaching events have noted differential mortality among coral colonies, species, and reefs [6, 9, 10] . This variability has been partially attributed to genetic and physiological differences among corals or their endosymbionts [11] [12] [13] , however, such explanations do not account for all available data. Evidence presented here suggests that differences in colony biomass also contribute to the mortality patterns in reef-building corals and may in some cases underlie differential survival following bleaching. Table 1 and a map of the collection localities is shown in Fig. 1 . Each reef was sampled seasonally, with sample periods designated here as winter (January-March), spring (April-June), summer (July-September), and fall (October-December). Occasionally, circumstances (e.g., storm activity) prohibited the collection of samples during a particular time point, and as a result, collection frequency ranged between two to four samplings per site per year. Collection durations at each site are listed in Table 1 .",

The effects of region, depth, and their interaction on tissue biomass or Symbiodinium density were tested using two-factor analyses of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's honestly-significant-difference tests (M. annularis, M. faveolata, A. cervicornis, and P. astreoides). When total population size was less than 3 across all sites, T-tests were used instead (M. franksi, A. palmata, and S. siderea). We used separate two-factor ANOVAs to test for effects on coral tissue biomass and Symbiodinium density instead of a single MANOVA because tissue biomass and symbiont density were often correlated (see results), thus violating assumptions of colinearity of variances in dependent variables. For all seven coral species, the effects of location, season, and their interaction on tissue biomass or Symbiodinium density were tested using two-factor ANOVAs. Changes in tissue biomass and Symbiodinium density coincident with bleaching events were examined by comparing parameter values during the bleaching event to the mean summer biomass or symbiont density value for that reef and species, excluding bleaching year data, using twosample protected T-tests. The mean summer value was used for these comparisons because this is the period in which tissue biomass and Symbiodinium density are typically the lowest each year [18] .",

The method (see Text S1) identified the single threshold value in the range between greatest ''dying'' value and lowest ''surviving'' value that had the lowest probability of incorrectly classifying a coral as surviving or dying based on its actual measured tissue biomass and known fate (given that the data were normally distributed). Thresholds were tested in increments of 0.1 across the differential range; threshold values were considered to be acceptable if their probability of misclassification was less than 0.05. Thus, mortality threshold analysis resulted in a single optimum value and range of acceptable values for each differential range tested.

Montastraea annularis and M. franksi colonies that died at CF reef had consistently lower mean tissue biomass values relative to M. faveolata from CF reef, and relative to conspecific and congeneric corals from other deep (12-15 m) reefs(Figs. 5, 7). The low tissue biomass of M. annularis and M. franksi at CF reef predated the 1998 bleaching event and no sudden dip in biomass levels was observed after the 1998 bleaching. Instead, the Montastraea spp. corals with a low tissue biomass simply did not recover from bleaching and these colonies died within 4 months of the event.Coral colony death also occurred in 100% of the A. cervicornis colonies sampled from SP, ADM, CF, and AG reefs (black arrows,Fig. 8). At NP, PB, and LG reefs, A. cervicornis colonies experienced reductions in the surface area of living tissue and death of numerous colonies by the conclusion of sampling in[2006][2007]",

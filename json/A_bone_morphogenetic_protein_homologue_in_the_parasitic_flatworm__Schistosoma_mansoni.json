Members of the TGF-b superfamily can be split into two main subfamilies based on sequence homology and the different downstream pathways they activate, namely the TGF-b/activin/nodal subfamily and the bone morphogenetic protein/growth and differentiation factor/Muellerian inhibiting substance (BMP/GDF/MIS) subfamily (Shi and Massague, 2003) . The basic TGF-b signaling mechanism involves binding of the extracellular TGF-b homologue to a heterodimeric receptor complex resulting in the activation of specific cytoplasmic proteins (Smads) that eventually translocate to the nucleus to influence transcriptional responses. In mammals, it is known that members of the two subfamilies activate distinct classes of Smad proteins: TGF-b subfamily members activate Smad2 and Smad3 homologues while BMP subfamily members activate Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 homologues. Several components of TGF-b signaling have been characterised from S. mansoni including TGF-b receptors SmRK1 (also known as SmTbRI) (Davies et al., 1998) and SmRKII (also known as SmTbRII) (Forrester et al., 2004; Osman et al., 2006) , several Smad proteins (Beall et al., 2000; Osman et al., 2001 Osman et al., , 2004 Carlo et al., 2007) , and one homologue of the TGF-b subfamily, SmInAct (Freitas et al., 2007) .",

(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast/submitblast/s_mansoni). A scaffold (Smp_scaff000116) with sequence showing homology to BMP-like ligands was identified and the corresponding putative coding sequence was named SmBMP. The 5 0 and 3 0 ends of SmBMP were isolated using total RNA (1 lg) from adult parasites and the Superscript III Generacer RACE kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An SmBMP-specific primer was designed for isolating the 3 end (5 0 -TTGGGTTATTG CACCACAAG-3 0 ) and was used with the Generacer 3 primer in reverse transcription (RT)-PCR as per the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting amplicon was cloned into the TA-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced. An in silico analysis of the S. mansoni genome aided in the identification of the 5 0 end of SmBMP. The Wellcome Trust's Sanger Institutes S. mansoni predicted coding sequence databases (Augustus3, Glim-merHMM and Twinscan2) were searched for SmBMP by performing a blastn search of each database with the isolated 3 end of SmBMP. Each algorithm suggested different start sites and forward primers were designed corresponding to each (Augustus3 0 -ATGAAATATG CAAATGTCAGTT-3 0 ; GlimmerHMM 5 -ATGTT TAAATTACATGAACGTCATA-3 ; Twinscan2 5 -ATGGGGGAAAAGT CACTTACTCT-3 0 ). Each forward primer was used individually with an SmBMP-specific reverse primer (5 -TGGAAATGGACATTGACCT AAAC A-3 0 ) in an RT-PCR using cercariae cDNA as template. Only the combination of the GlimmerHMM forward primer with the SmBMP-specific reverse primer amplified a product of predicted size which was confirmed to be SmBMP upon sequencing. Further in silico analysis revealed a long open reading frame (1027 bp) upstream of the predicted GlimmerHMM 5 end. To isolate the 5 end of SmBMP, two SmBMP-specific reverse primers were designed within the GlimmerHMM amplified region and were used in 5 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (5 -CTGGTTCAAAAATGGCT GCGGTTTG-3 0 ) and nested 5 0 RACE (5 0 -TGCTGCAACTAATTTTT CATTTGAAGGT-3 0 ) reactions using the Generacer RACE kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting amplicon was cloned and was confirmed by sequencing to be SmBMP (GenBank Accession No. EU684544).",

The 5 0 and 3 0 ends of SmBMP were isolated via 5 0 and 3 0 RACE using SmBMP-specific primers designed from within the predicted coding sequence according to the genome sequence and adult parasite cDNA as template. The full-length transcript is 3013 bp including a 124 bp 5 untranslated region (UTR) and a 102 bp 3 0 UTR with a poly-A tail. The deduced amino acid sequence of SmBMP is 931 residues and contains many of the molecular characteristics of a BMP homologue including several putative proteolytic cleavage sites at positions 660 (RKPR), 700 (RYKR), 703 (RLQR), 738 (RSRR) and 748 bp (RHNR) where the bioactive, C-terminal domain (268-180 amino acids) could be enzymatically cleaved from the N-terminal pro-domain (Fig. 1) . Seven invariant cysteine residues are predicted in SmBMP along with other invariant residues (proline 851 and glycine 861) necessary for proper tertiary structure and dimerisation of a functional BMP homologue (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, signal sequence prediction software suggests the N-terminus of SmBMP does not contain a secretion signal. Within the C-terminal conserved domain (the last $100 amino acids), SmBMP is 51% and 47% identical to BMP homologues from the free-living flatworms Schmidtea mediterranea and Dugesia japonica, respectively (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, it is 46% identical to D. melanogaster DPP and 49% identical to human BMP2 at the amino acid level (Fig. 2) . Phylogenetic analysis of SmBMP among other members of the TGF-b superfamily groups this homologue with members of the BMP subfamily ( Fig. 3 ) and most closely with BMP-like ligands from S. mediterranea and D. japonica (Smed-BMP and DjBMP). This close clustering is expected considering all three worms are members of the phylum Platyhelminthes. Based on this analysis, it cannot be determined whether SmBMP is most closely related to members of the BMP2/4 or BMP5/8 subfamilies.",

In this study, we report the identification and characterisation of SmBMP, a BMP homologue in S. mansoni. SmBMP is expressed in medically important stages of the parasite, namely the egg, cercariae and adult parasites and localises to the protonephridia of the adult worm. A recent review by Loverde and colleagues alludes to a BMP homologue in the S. mansoni genome (Loverde et al., 2007) . Assuming the gene described in this review is that found in Genbank under Accession No. EF028064, we believe the BMP homologue characterised in this study is the same as that described by Loverde et al. with two exceptions: (i) our clone's deduced amino acid sequence is 402 amino acids longer at the N-terminus and (ii) the putative cleavage site is not 129 amino acids upstream from the stop codon, but rather 272 amino acids upstream, with a second and/or third potential cleavage site(s) at either 194 or 184 amino acids upstream of the stop codon. Multiple cleavage sites are not atypical of BMP homologues (Cui et al., 2001) . This would make the molecular weight of the SmBMP active dimer to be approximately 74 kDa (or $44 kDa from either of the downstream sites), rather than the previously described 23 kDa (Loverde et al., 2007) .",

For example, SmBMP is 530 residues longer than its most related homologue, Smed-BMP and 535 residues longer than human BMP2. Most of this increased length is attributed to a longer N-terminus of SmBMP; 659 amino acids lie upstream of the first cleavage site of SmBMP (737 and 747 residues are upstream of the second and third potential cleavage sites, respectively) while 287 make up the N-terminus of Smed-BMP. Functions of the pro-domain in BMP homologues include directing the ligand to the extracellular matrix (Gregory et al., 2005) and in protein stability (Constam and Robertson, 1999) . Furthermore, the pro-domain is believed to be essential for proper dimerisation and folding of nearly all TGF-b superfamily members (Gray and Mason, 1990) . It remains possible that, because different stages of S. mansoni live at different temperatures ($24\u00b0C in the intermediate snail host and environment and at 37\u00b0C in the definitive host), this longer prodomain may aid in proper folding of the protein regardless of temperature.",

Recently, RNA interference (RNAi) studies have shown that BMP signaling plays a role in specifying the DV axis in the free-living planaria D. japonica and S. mediterranea (Molina et al., 2007; Orii and Watanabe, 2007) . Considering SmBMP is most closely related to the BMP homologues isolated from these free-living flatworms and that, while S. mansoni is a trematode and D. japonica and S. mediterranea are free-living flatworms, they are nonetheless closely related phylogenetically, it is likely that SmBMP plays a similar role in S. mansoni. We treated adult parasites as well as growing schistosomula with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) corresponding to SmBMP, however, while $40% knockdown was observed using quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown), immediate phenotypes were not observed. This could be due to insufficient knockdown compared with that obtained in D. japonica and S. mediterranea. It is appealing to speculate that the increase expression of SmBMP Shaded residues represent the invariant cysteine, proline and glycine moieties of all BMP homologues.

                "text": "The localisation of SmBMP in S. mansoni is different than that observed of the two other platyhelminth BMP homologues where SmBMP is expressed in the protonephridia while DjBMP and Smed-BMP are found along the dorsal midline (Orii et al., 1998; Molina et al., 2007) . The protonephridia is believed to serve as a primitive kidney, functioning to regulate the composition of fluids in the organism and in the clearance of metabolic wastes (Wilson and Webster, 1974) . Other protein processing and secreting functions have also been proposed for this organ (Finken-Eigen and Kunz, 1997; Skelly and Shoemaker, 2001) . One possible explanation for the discrepancy in localisation could be the methods employed. We used immunofluorescence on worm sections to localise SmBMP while whole-mount in situ hybridisation was used to localise both DjBMP and Smed-BMP in the free-living worms. Therefore, we could be detecting cells that have simply bound and are responding to SmBMP as opposed to those actually producing it. Additionally, considering the potential of the protonephridia to serve as a means of protein excretion/secretion, localisation of SmBMP here may be explained by impending release of SmBMP in excretory/secretory products. To this end, we isolated proteins in the excretory/secretory products of adult male parasites using our antibodies against SmBMP, suggesting SmBMP is secreted by the parasite. This is an interesting finding in that secreted forms of SmBMP will have the opportunity to interact with host receptors. Lastly, BMP signaling is known to play an important role in the development of the vertebrate kidney (reviewed in Cain et al., 2008) . Thus, it remains possible that SmBMP functions in the development and/or maintenance of the trematode protonephridia. .

If SmBMP ligation to its receptor leads to the phosphorylation of both of these Smad1 homologues, SmBMP may have distinct functions in cells that express SmSmad1, SmSmad1b or a combination of the two, by mediating different transcriptional responses. To our knowledge, only one Smad1 homologue has been identified in free-living flatworms (Molina et al., 2007) .

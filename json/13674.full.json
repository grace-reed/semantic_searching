Symbiodinium is a common symbiont in many cnidarian species including corals, jellyfish, anemones, and giant clams. Here, we provide evidence that most members of clade A Symbiodinium, but not clades B-D or F, exhibit enhanced capabilities for alternative photosynthetic electron-transport pathways including cyclic electron transport (CET). Unlike other clades, clade A Symbiodinium also undergo pronounced light-induced dissociation of antenna complexes from photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers. We propose these attributes promote survival of most cnidarians with clade A symbionts at high light intensities and confer resistance to bleaching conditions that conspicuously impact deeper dwelling corals that harbor non-clade A Symbiodinium.",

Coral species distribution largely correlates with prevailing light and temperature gradients and likely is influenced by the differing photosynthetic and light tolerance properties of their symbionts coupled with host-symbiont specificity and biogeographical distribution (3) (4) (5) (6) . Hence, Symbiodinium phylotypes, predominantly clades A, B, and C and sometimes clade D and their respective hosts are found at characteristic depth ranges (4, 7) . Clade A Symbiodinium are especially prevalent in shallow-water cnidarians including corals, jellyfish, and anemones in the Caribbean (4) . Clade A isolates abundantly produce UV-protective mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) in culture whereas all clades, with a depthdependent correlation, synthesize MAAs in hospice, especially mycosporine-glycine, which effectively absorbs harmful UV-B wavelengths (8) . Little else is known about distinct physiological properties of Symbiodinium species and their susceptibilities to temperature and high light stress, although corals harboring clade D have been observed to be high-temperature tolerant (9) .",

Low degrees of fatty acid desaturation in thylakoid lipid membranes of cultured dinoflagellates have been correlated with elevated temperature tolerance and reduced production of reactive oxygen species under high irradiance, but there is not a strict correlation with heat sensitivity along Symbiodinium cladal lines (12) .",

Photoprotection mechanisms identified in Symbiodinium include engagement of xanthophyll deepoxidation associated with nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) within intrinsic light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) (14, 15) and longer-term photoacclimation processes that modulate the abundance and size of photosynthetic units and peripheral peridinin-chlorophyll-aprotein (PCP) antenna complexes (16, 17) .",

SIP treatment clearly does not lead to reduction of PQ in clade B Symbiodinium ( Fig. 1 B and D) indicating sustained linear electron transport activities between PSII and PSI in contrast to clade A cells. The lengthy duration of flashes and limited sensitivity of the instruments and detectors used enable only an approximation of F m and F m \u0408 levels (19) . However, the multiturnover excitation of PSII to drive water oxidation is beneficial to initiating and poising PQ in a reduced state as is apparent from clade A F 0 \u0408 increases.

During following dark phases, PQ reduction (F 0 \u0408) then returns to levels above that of the prepulse signal with approximate half-times of \u03f710 s in culture ( (Fig. 1C Inset) . A similar phenomenon has been described in a few other algae, but under conditions of limited electron acceptors and/or anaerobiosis (20) . Such postillumination PQ reduction signals have also been observed after prolonged illumination of isolated spinach chloroplasts (21) and in leaves of C4 plants (22) .

Overall, the clade A fluorescence responses are ascribed to PSI-dependent plastoquinol oxidation followed by PQ rereduction by CET and/or chlororespiration (23, 24) .

Because MV interacts directly with PSI (17) , it intercepts PSI electron transfer and downstream ferredoxin and NADPH-mediated processes, including ferredoxin-mediated CET through cytochrome b 6 /f and/or NAD(P)H-driven chlororespiration. The MV effect also indicates that PSII photodamage is not responsible for the SIP-induced F 0 \u0408 increase. Negative results of SIP treatments with clade B Symbiodinium certify the fluorescence phenomena in clade A are not an experimental artifact ( Fig. 1 B and D) . Also, measurements with clade A yield identical SIP responses when PAM fluorometry is used with settled cells in culture flasks (data not shown).

Fig. 1C shows that clade A Symbiodinium from a Caribbean coral also exhibits diagnostic clade A SIP responses in hospice. Porites astreoides specimen were collected from shallow water (2 m), and their symbionts show an identical response to cultured clade A cells ( Fig. 1 A) when SIP-assayed with the submergible Diving-PAM (Fig. 1C ). Subsequent genotyping by using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the rDNA ITS2 region (5) confirmed the predominance of subclade A4a symbionts. Symbionts of deeper dwelling P. astreoides consistently show no SIP-induced F 0 fluctuations and harbor C1 Symbiodinium (4) . Similarly, corals like Montastraea faveolata hosting subclade B1 Symbiodinium exhibit flat line F 0 \u0408 and F m \u0408 when SIP-probed ( Fig. 1D ). We additionally surveyed many other species of cnidarians known to host clade A Symbiodinium in the Caribbean including corals Acropora cervicornis and Acropora palmata, anemones Aiptasia pallida and Bartholomea annulata, and the jellyfish Cassiopeia xamachana, as well as others known to host clades B and C. Employing SIP, only cnidarians harboring clade A Symbiodinium consistently display CET signals and flash-induced NPQ in hospice. Among cultured clade A, only subclade A2 isolates from a sea fan and a clam do not yield a CET SIP response (Table S1) .",

Analogous to model systems subjected to continuous illumination, this F m \u0408 decrease can follow from reduced cytochrome b 6 /f-dependent activation of chloroplast protein kinases to phosphorylate/dissociate PSII LHCs, conformational changes of LHCs by means of a large decrease of thylakoid lumen pH, activation of xanthophyll deepoxidase on lumen pH decline, or a combination of such excitation energy dissipation mechanisms (18) . Dinoflagellates uniquely possess peripheral antennae PCP complexes, presumed to reside in the thylakoid lumen, that function to maximize green light energy transfer to PSII (26, 27) .

PSII-dependent oxygen evolution would promote the two latter pathways. We found that anaerobic conditions double the rate of SIP-induced PQ reduction (Fig. S1 ). Imposing anaerobic con-ditions ( Fig. 3C ), light-adapted clade A cells exhibit a postillumination F 0 \u0408 increase with an overall half-time of 30 s. A similar signal, although weaker, is observed in clade B Symbiodinium but under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions ( Fig. 3 B and D) . Clearly, clade A Symbiodinium is capable of more complete engagement of NPQ as indicated by the fluorescence decrease in response to continuous illumination as compared with clade B cells. Additionally, substantial but gradual dark PQ reduction, likely due to partial engagement of a chlororespiration pathway, is discernable when the oxygen electron acceptor for photorespiration, chlororespiration, and/or pathways related to the Mehler reaction is diminished. Collapse of a transthylakoid pH gradient at the onset of darkness in clade B Symbiodinium and, partially in clade A cells, could also contribute to the F 0 \u0408 postillumination increase.",

However, no definitive evidence for state transition-like mechanisms in Symbiodinium or other dinoflagellates have been documented. Fluorescence spectra at 77 K of dark-acclimated clade A Symbiodinium show that both intrinsic LHCs and extrinsic PCPs are fully connected to PSII as is apparent in the major fluorescence emission peak at 686 nm, presumably from the CP43 core antennae (Fig. 4A) (32) . Excitation spectra of 686 nm show a strong contribution of PCP with novel peridinin absorption in the 530-nm region, along with the \u03f7400-nm Soret bands of chl (Fig. 4B) . That PCPs are fully PSII-associated in darkadapted cells is evidenced by minimal emission at 673 nm where a fluorescence shoulder from unassociated PCP chl-a would be selectively detected (Fig. 4B) (26, 33) .",

We estimate from light/dark fluorescence spectral differences that almost half of the PCP population, perhaps together with integral LHCs dissociates from PSII as a major component of NPQ on prolonged light exposure in clade A Symbiodinium. No modifications of fluorescence emission spectra are detected in clade B and C Symbiodinium in response to these illumination conditions (Fig. S2) .",

In Symbiodinium, such a State 2 antenna association with PSI is not substantial (Fig. S2 ). When exposed to prolonged FR, the classical algal state transition response is antenna reversion from PSI to PSII connectivity (State 1) (35) . Surprisingly, clade A cells respond to far-red irradiation differently, displaying dual fluorescence peaks at 675 nm and 683 nm, whereas 686-nm emission from PSII is minimized (Fig. 4C) . The emergent 683-nm peak is best ascribed to disconnected intrinsic chl-a/c LHCs (33) antenna as evidenced by a chl-c contribution near 458 nm (27) . The loss of 686-nm fluorescence could be due to diminished PSII integrity resulting from dissociation of core antenna CP43 in combination with the PSII disconnection of LHCs ( Fig. 4 A and C) . We attribute pronounced CET and After dark incubation for 10 min and supplementation with 10 mM bicarbonate to maximize carbon fixation, cultures of subclades A3 (A and C) and B2 (B and D) were bubbled with air (A and B) or argon (C and D) to impose aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively.

From the studies presented here, corals with clade A Symbiodinium are likely more resistant to combinations of high light and high temperature, conditions common at the end of summer (13) , because of their enhanced and constitutive alternative photosynthetic electron pathways and photoprotection processes. CET and chlororespiration (37) may also serve to minimize oxygen evolution thereby decreasing the probability of the formation of and damage by reactive oxygen species. We propose that CET can sustain ATP synthesis and underlies clade A symbiont survival during warm conditions that can exacerbate PSII loss. Analogous to the case of PSII-less tobacco mutants (38) , CET and/or chlororespiration could become dominant means for photosynthetic energy transduction during bleaching episodes. However, whether some non-clade A symbionts might conditionally develop CET and significant antenna dissociation capacity in response to elevated temperature deserves further study.",

Excitation spectra were measured at 673 nm or 683 nm and corrected for instrument response. Fig. 4 . Light-Induced PCP and Intrinsic LHC Dissociation from PSII in clade A3 Symbiodinium. (A) The 77 K fluorescence emission spectra at excitation wavelengths 440 nm (solid line) and 530 nm (dashed line). (B) Excitation spectra of the same clade A3 cells detected at 673 nm (solid line) and 683 nm (dashed line) after 60-min dark adaptation. The dark-acclimated excitation spectrum, specifically the peridinin excitation shoulder at 530 nm, is higher at 683 nm than 673 nm as a result of the greater PSII connectivity of the PCP antenna complexes and resulting fluorescence. (C) Fluorescence emission spectra at excitation wavelengths of 440 nm (solid line) and 530 nm (dashed line) after exposure to 100 min of white light. The two emission peaks (675 and 686 nm) in both excitation spectra from white light-adapted clade A3 cells reflect partial dissociation of LHCs from PSII. Prolonged FR illumination (\u03fe690 nm) results in further loss of PSII 686 nm fluorescence, whereas 683-nm emission from PCPs and intrinsic LHCs is enhanced (solid line). No far-red-induced fluorescence shifts occur in clade B (dotted-dashed line). (D) Fluorescence excitation spectra of the same clade A3 cells as in C at detection wavelengths of 673 nm (solid line) and 683 nm (dashed line) after 100 min of actinic light exposure, showing a pronounced peridinin contribution to 675-nm emission by 530-nm excitation in comparison with that of dark-adapted cells in B.",

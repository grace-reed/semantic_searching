    "abstract": "The phylogenetic diversity of bacterial communities in response to environmental disturbances such as organic pollution has been well studied, but little is known about the way in which organic contaminants influence the acclimation of functional bacteria. In the present study, tolerance assays for bacterial communities from the sediment in the Pearl River Estuary were conducted with the isolation of functional bacteria using pyrene and different estrogens as environmental stressors. Molecular ecological networks and phylogenetic trees were constructed using both 16S rRNA gene sequences of cultured bacterial strains and 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing data to illustrate the successions of bacterial communities and their acclimations to the different organic compounds. A total of 111 bacterial strains exhibiting degradation and endurance capabilities in response to the pyrene estrogen-induced stress were successfully isolated and were mainly affiliated with three orders, Pseudomonadales, Vibrionales, and Rhodobacterales. Molecular ecological networks and phylogenetic trees showed various adaptive abilities of bacteria to the different organic compounds. For instance, some bacterial OTUs could be found only in particular organic compoundtreated groups while some other OTUs could tolerate stresses from different organic compounds. Furthermore, the results indicated that some new phylotypes were emerged under stresses of different organic pollutions and these new phylotypes could adapt to the contaminated environments and contribute significantly to the microbial community shifts. Overall, this study demonstrated a crucial role of the community succession and the acclimation of functional bacteria in the adaptive responses to various environmental disturbances.",

                "text": "Bacteria can adapt to a range of different habitats, including contaminated and extreme environments, and they can perform a wide diversity of physiological activities (Dash et al., 2013) . In terms of pollution, bacteria can play both positive and negative roles in an ecosystem, first by degrading organic waste and then by spreading the resultant dangerous contaminants. They have been well acknowledged as central players in the health of all organisms and ecosystems (Layeghifard et al., 2016) . Considering their extensive capabilities for degrading organic contaminants, bacteria have been widely considered for bioremediation in different polluted environments. For instance, Mishamandani et al. (2016) investigated the bacterial community responses associated with the cosmopolitan marine diatom (Skeletonema costatum) used to counteract crude oil pollution. The results demonstrated that hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria in the phycosphere of phytoplankton could contribute significantly to biodegradation of hydrocarbon contaminants in marine surface water. McDevitt-Irwin et al. (2017) explained the roles of microbial communities present in coral reefs and the way in which they behave or respond in the presence of various stresses (such as climate change, pollution, and overfishing) generated by the external environment. It was observed that these stresses could lead to a rise in disease-associated bacterial populations in the coral environment. In another example of adaptation, microbial strains under high-stress environments [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and steroid contamination] began growing, and were able to use these stress-producing substances as energy and carbon sources (Haritash and Kaushik, 2009) .",

These complex inter-taxa interactions make the collective microbiome more significant and effective than the function of any individual constituent species (Rogers et al., 2013; da Silva et al., 2014) . It is observed that ecological interactions within different microbial populations can easily influence microbiome composition as well as host health (Hansen et al., 2015) . These ecologically interactive microbial communities might compete for resources or exchange genetic material with hosts (Stecher et al., 2012) . In addition, some of the inter-taxa interactions or relationships may be beneficial for adapting different populations. One of them is microbial synergism, which was reported to increase the antibiotic resistance, biofilm development, tissue damage repairing, and environmental adaptation (Dalton et al., 2011; Murray et al., 2014) . Previous studies have demonstrated that microbial community composition related to ecosystem functioning constitutes the relationship between phylogeny and functional traits (Cadotte et al., 2008; Gravel et al., 2011) . To illustrate the complexity of relationships between different microbial communities, molecular ecological network reconstruction can be considered to represent and model the extent of the complexity (Layeghifard et al., 2016) . These reconstructions can be used to explore the characteristics of these polymicrobial interactions (Hacquard et al., 2015) .",

Obvious succession/shifts of the communities or populations can be detected when their living environments change, especially those subjected to the stresses induced by different organic contaminant. The responses and functional traits of different individuals in a community after an environmental change can be used to predict composition shifts and subsequent effects on the ecosystem (Garnier et al., 2004; Allison and Martiny, 2008; Suding et al., 2008; D\u00edaz et al., 2013) .

After sediment inoculation in MSM, different organic pollutants, comprising 100 mg/L of pyrene and 20 mg/L of E1, E2, E3, and EE2, were added individually as external environmental stresses. Aliquots (100 \u00b5L) of liquid cultures at different incubation time points (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 , and 30 days) were diluted serially 10-fold and an additional 100 \u00b5L of the three dilutions (10 \u22124 , 10 \u22125 , and 10 \u22126 ) were spread onto MSM agar plates pretreated with pyrene or the different estrogens (E1, E2, E3, or EE2). The MSM agar plates were prepared by adding 2% of agar powder (BD Biosciences, United States) into MSM liquid medium. All plates were incubated at 25 \u2022 C for the next 3 days in order to examine microbial growth. The colonies having different morphological features were streaked individually onto MSM agar plates, pre-supplemented with the different organic pollutants, and incubated again for another 3 days at 25 \u2022 C for growth. A single colony of each isolate was further cultured in marine broth 2216E (BD Biosciences, United States) overnight to cultivate enough bacterial cells for cryopreservation (\u221280 \u2022 C with addition of 30% glycerol) and DNA extraction. Genomic DNA of each individual isolate was extracted by using an Ultra-Clean microbial DNA isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, United States). The PCR amplification of each isolate's 16S rRNA gene was carried out using universal primers 27F and 1492R (Wang et al., 2012) and then sequenced at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of each isolate was further analyzed by using the BLASTn tool [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), United States] and presumptively identified on the bases of the top BLAST hits.",

The correlation interpretation between functional groups of different organic compounds without considering the abundance of different bacterial phylotypes was carried out using molecular ecological network analysis. The pyrene-treated samples appeared to generate more OTUs compared to the estrogen-treated samples. Some OTUs showed an obvious bias to the different substrates. For instance, OTUs 12 and 16 (Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp., respectively) were found only in the pyrene-treated groups, while OTU5 (Vibrio spp.) was detected only in the E1-treated samples. Other estrogen-treated (E2) samples also had their own specific OTUs (OTU37, Donghicola spp.). Nevertheless, some functional bacterial species also exhibited extensive interactions with different pollutants, which indicated a positive response from these bacterial species toward the different organic pollutants, and hence they might play a significant role in the degradation of different pollutants. For example, OTUs 1 and 15 (Vibrio spp. and Pseudomonas spp., respectively) were found to be common in both pyrene-and estrogens-treated samples. OTUs 1, 15, and 26 (Vibrio spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Labrenzia spp., respectively) were shared by pyrene-and E1-treated samples. In addition, the OTUs under pyrene tolerance were different from those isolated from MSM plates with added estrogens. For example, OTU15 (Pseudomonas spp.) could only be detected after E1 and E3 treatments. The heatmap profile analysis indicated that quantitative changes in different bacterial phylotypes in pyreneand estrogens-treated samples had occurred. Results from the analysis indicated that some of the functional bacteria emerged in both pyrene-and estrogens-treated groups. The presence of some new bacterial phylotypes was also observed in pyrene-treated samples after 30 days of incubation. Results from the above analysis indicated that, during ecological diversity investigation, certain specific functional phylotypes should also be considered along with whole local communities.",

The NMDS plots showed that relatively large changes in bacterial communities occurred at 12 and 24 days, while small community changes were observed before 6 days. The initial large changes in bacterial community at 12 days could be attributed to adaptation of the seeded bacterial communities to the stress environment. The community profiles from 12 days were most widely dispersed and distantly located from the profiles from the early communities. This seemed to be mainly affected by the maintenance of highly dominant Alteromonadales populations and the decrease of Vibrionales and Desulfobacterales until the end of incubation (Supplementary Figure S3 ). Metaxa2 (Bengtsson-Palme et al., 2015) was used to select sequences affiliating into orders Pseudomonadales, Vibrionales, and Rhodobacterales from the entire NGS sequencing data. And 2041 OTUs, 8863 OTUs and 5267 OTUs for each bacterial group (Supplementary Table S3 ) were generated by CD-HIT software. In the presence of pyrene, the number of the OTUs affiliated into Pseudomonadales, Vibrionales, and Rhodobacterales showed dramatical increase at the first 6 days ( Figure 5 ). An obvious decrease of OTUs was observed after 12 days for all three bacterial groups which might due to the redundancy reduction. Like composition of culturable bacterial communities, the bacterial communities after 12 days revealed by NGS were also dominated by key functional OTUs, such as OTU P50 (Acinetobacter spp.), OTU V0 (Photobacterium spp.), and OTU R1 (Ruegeria spp.). Moreover, the molecular ecological network based on NGS data (Supplementary Figure S4) showed that the variant density of functional OTUs and the appearance of new phylotypes at different time points.",

In addition to bacterial strains that originally showed degradation capabilities, the residual cultured community might also mutate in order to adapt to the changing environment, thus generating new phylotypes. The most interesting discovery from the present study was that of OTU functional redundancy accompanied by phylogenetic changes in some bacterial phylotypes. The results of molecular ecological network and heatmap analyses revealed that there were no obvious changes in OTU amounts even when different substrates were used. The presence of new OTUs in samples with the addition of different organic compounds suggests an adaptive response in the surviving groups (Diaz-Ravina and Baath, 1996; B\u00e5\u00e5th et al., 1998) . For instance, the functional population Vibrio fluvialis mainly included one phylotype (OTU1) before being co-incubated with EE2, while two new OTUs (OTUs 6 and 8) emerged under EE2-induced stress. Similarly, two new phylotypes (OTUs 13 and 24) affiliated to Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes were also detected after the addition of the organic pollutants, while only OTU15 was identified in the original samples. These new phylotypes were capable of tolerating or degrading the additional organic pollutants and acted as a substitute for those phylotypes, which were unsuitable to the changing environment, thus led to a community shift. This shift of ecological diversity could be attributed to physiological changes in the community or to the indirect effects on other members of the community (B\u00e5\u00e5th et al., 1998) . Due to the new phylotypes, the ecological diversity of the population and community could remain stable.",

Sequences affiliated into the three cultured bacterial orders, Pseudomonadales (0.03-3.46%), Vibrionales (0.21-26.22%), and Rhodobacterales (0.45-4.02%), were abundant and showed dramatic degrading efficiency to pyrene. However, the dominant bacterial sequences at different time points were all affiliated into another bacterial order, Alteromonadales. Bacteria in this order were anticipated to have potential function for metabolizing different hydrocarbons (Jin et al., 2012) . Considering the dramatic increase of this order, these bacteria were believed to play important roles in degrading pyrene. Unfortunately, bacteria in this order were not successfully isolated in this study. This might ascribe that the majority (> 99%) of microorganisms from the environment was uncultivated in the laboratory (Kaeberlein et al., 2002) . In addition, bacteria in the order Alteromonadales were often associated to nutrient-rich environments (L\u00f3pez-P\u00e9rez and Rodriguez-Valera, 2014).

First, it was due to methodological flaws or primers biases (Donachie et al., 2007) . This could be effectively avoided by using pure culture in this study. Second, some \"rare\" microbes being insensitive to prevailing environmental conditions (Sun et al., 2013) could be selected, which was important in response to the changing environments (organic compounds in this study) (KleinJan et al., 2017) . These rare functional bacteria could be neglected by the insufficient sequencing or insufficient culture time (Skopina et al., 2016) . These rare bacteria could serve as a \"seed bank\" (Pedr\u00f3s-Ali\u00f3,, 2012), which contributed to the stabilization of bacterial communities (Jousset et al., 2017) . Other hypothesis based on current results could be that the occurrence of new phylotypes was caused by evolutionary responses of culturable bacterial communities to the stresses of environmental pollutions. Genetic adaptation provided a means for bacteria adapting or responding to various stresses. The genetic adaptation process comprises three mechanisms: (1) induction and depression of enzymes;",

The evolutionary changes shown in the phylogenetic trees could influence population dynamics, species interactions, and even ecosystem functioning (Post and Palkovacs, 2009; Schoener, 2011; Pfennig and Pfennig, 2012; Matthews et al., 2014) . The present results were consistent with previous studies in which wide variations among the strains of Acinetobacter, Vibrio, and others were illustrated after considering their ability to use different carbon substrates (Sarma et al., 2004; Keymer et al., 2007; Vieira et al., 2011) . The role of evolution was well acknowledged in community studies (Weber et al., 2017) . The phylogenetic relevance analysis could effectively reveal evolutionary changes among these functional culturable bacteria. Phylogenetic changes were believed to be necessary for the maintenance of the local ecology, especially under extreme environmental conditions. Furthermore, for the relevant comparative phylogenetic studies, there must be proper interplay between ecology and evolution (Weber et al., 2017) . The results also indicated that the rapid evolution of functional bacteria responding for changing environments (such as the evolutionary responses of phytoplankton) appeared to be very important for their survival (Padfield et al., 2016) .",

The results revealed that the organic pollutant-induced stresses could significantly influence the bacterial community composition, as well as the acclimation of functional bacteria in these communities. The appearance of new phylotypes under these stress conditions was favorable for community stability as well as for the remediation of the polluted environment. The overall results indicated that the acclimation of functional bacteria was crucial for the adaptation of bacterial communities to environmental disturbances. Considering the finite number of pure cultures and limited information 16S rRNA gene based NGS, this study could not provide a complete picture of the acclimation of bacterial communities to changing environments. The future work could be addressed by (i) analyzing the genomic changes of specific bacterial species to illustrate the mechanism of their capabilities of biodegradation or tolerance; (ii) revealing the co-acclimation and co-evolution of bacterial communities based on metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic data; and (iii) isolating \"uncultivable\" functional bacteria in pure culture for comprehensively revealing the function of bacterial community under the press of organic compounds.",

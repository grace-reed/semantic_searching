    "abstract": "Background: Lake Baikal is one of the oldest freshwater lakes and has constituted a stable environment for millions of years, in stark contrast to small, transient bodies of water in its immediate vicinity. A highly diverse endemic endemic amphipod fauna is found in one, but not the other habitat. We ask here whether differences in stress response can explain the immiscibility barrier between Lake Baikal and non-Baikal faunas. To this end, we conducted exposure experiments to increased temperature and the toxic heavy metal cadmium as stressors. Results: Here we obtained high-quality de novo transcriptome assemblies, covering mutiple conditions, of three amphipod species, and compared their transcriptomic stress responses. Two of these species, Eulimnogammarus verrucosus and E. cyaneus, are endemic to Lake Baikal, while the Holarctic Gammarus lacustris is a potential invader. Conclusions: Both Baikal species possess intact stress response systems and respond to elevated temperature with relatively similar changes in their expression profiles. G. lacustris reacts less strongly to the same stressors, possibly because its transcriptome is already perturbed by acclimation conditions.",

Gammarus lacustris Sars, 1863 is common throughout the Holarctic and inhabits very diverse environments, including water bodies in the direct vicinity of Baikal, but the species in general does not intermix with the Baikal endemic gammarid fauna.

These factors can be an explanation why endemic Baikal gammarids that are highly adapted to a narrow window of environmental conditions are unable to survive in those waters for longer periods. On the other hand, it is a question why species that are ubiquitous in the Palearctic and have adapted to survive in a wide range of environmental conditions are unable to establish stable populations in Lake Baikal. Individuals of G. lacustris, for instance, common in water bodies in the direct vicinity of Lake Baikal, may be frequently introduced into the lake, either from the streams entering Lake Baikal, by birds or by humans when used as fish bait.",

The peculiarities of Lake Baikal water (see above) may require particular adaptations of aquatic species. Currently, Baikal water is generally highly pristine, and the Lake Baikal endemics may, therefore, be particularly sensitive to chemical water contamination. However, global warming and anthropogenic pollution, e.g. with heavy metals, can change the environmental condition of the Baikal littoral zone. This is why we explored how the gammarids respond to chemical or temperature stress at Lake Baikal water conditions and if there are specific molecular adaptations that provide an advantage to G. lacustris over the Eulimnogammarus species in the changing environment. We explored the transcriptomes of individuals of the three species upon acclimation to pristine Lake Baikal conditions, i.e., Baikal water at 6\u00b0C and from short term (3-24 h) species-specific treatments with cadmium and elevated temperature.",

For a gross proportion of these transcripts, amounting to about 10% of the different transcript sequences and about 25% of the overall expression, the closest matches were metazoan proteins. Thus, these transcripts can be considered to be originating from gammarid genomes. A considerable number of annotated transcripts amounting to about 5-10% of all transcripts and 5-10% of total expression could clearly be assigned to Ciliophora, which are known to be associated with the gammarids as commensals or symbionts [11] . The remaining transcripts either aligned to proteins from other groups of organisms (presumably symbionts or commensals) or could not be assigned and remained unannotated. Finally, we created a reduced data set with non-redundant sequences most probably originating from the target organism ( Fig. 1a ; labeled with ani), which would serve as references for mapping reads in the differential expression analysis. As we could not interpret the unannotated transcripts, we did not include them into this reduced set, even though they may represent sequences highly specific for this group of the organisms.",

For E. verrucosus the range of the temperatures causing no and 100% lethality was with 24-26\u00b0C comparatively narrow, whereas this range was wider for E. cyaneus with 23-28\u00b0C and for G. lacustris with 23-29\u00b0C.

To account for this possibility, we relaxed the stringency of our filtering (at least two-fold decrease in expression with adjusted p-value < 0.05) and looked for transcripts annotated as potential ribosomal proteins in G. lacustris. Indeed, we found two transcripts annotated as L37 and L23 proteins down-regulated in G. lacustris after 3 h of heat shock; no difference in the amount of ribosomal protein-encoding transcripts could be detected after 24 h of heat shock in this species.

Metallothionein (MT)-encoding sequences have been reported from the genome and transcriptome of Hyalella azteca Saussure, 1858 [21] an the transcriptome of another amphipod species, Grandidierella japonica Stephensen, 1938 [22] ; the abundance of these sequences was approximately two-fold higher in response to zinc exposure ( [21, 22] ) and even 16-fold higher in response to cadmium exposure ( [21] ). Therefore, we looked for transcripts that potentially encoded MT in our full datasets and found from 3 (in G. lacustris) to 13 (in E. cyaneus) such transcripts in our assemblies (Additional file 6). However, none of the transcripts was differentially expressed according to our standards, even though the majority of transcripts in Baikal species had higher median abundance values under cadmium treatment (Additional file 1; Fig. 4d ). Moreover, most of the transcripts had low expression: only six transcripts in E. cyaneus, one transcript in E. verrucosus and no transcripts in G. lacustris had abundance higher than one transcript per million (Additional file 1: Figure S3 ). Expression levels of the two most abundant transcripts are shown in Fig. 4d . The predicted protein sequences encoded by these transcripts are identical, and the most similar sequence in the NCBI nr database turned out to be the MT of a deep-sea vent brachyuran crab Allograea tomentosa Guinot, Hurtado & Vrijenhoek, 2002. The sequence of A. tomentosa was only 53% identical to those of Eulimnogammarus sp., but all the Cys residues were conserved within the three proteins (Additional file 1: Figure S3 ), suggesting that these transcripts indeed encode metallothionein-like proteins. These transcripts were not differentially expressed under cadmium treatment according to our criteria. The fold change was not consistent between the two time points, and while the expression change observed in E. verrucosus upon 24-h treatment had an associated p-value of 0.002, in E. cyaneus it was 0.78, even though independent testing of these values without correction for multiple testing would return a p-value of 0.029. Thus, the questions of specificity of the putative products of these transcripts and regulation of their expression in response to heavy metals remain open.",

To test these hypotheses, we built scatterplots for all genes that were differentially expressed in response to at least one of the treatments after 24-h exposure (Fig. 5 ) and also fitted linear regression models to describe common tendencies. The regression lines are closer to the horizontal axis, thus showing that the response to elevated temperature is generally more pronounced than the response to cadmium treatment ( Fig. 5) , especially in the case of E. verrucosus.

We are not aware of studies exploring the differential expression of transposable elements in amphipods, but such analysis has been performed for an insect, Locusta migratoria ssp., and revealed changes between life stages [23] , but we only studied the adult form.

This result allows us to conclude that Baikal amphipods have intact stress response systems, which reacted to either stressor. However, changes in the expression of some transcripts were stressor-specific. The existence of heat-shock specific hsp transcripts might mean that there is more than one system regulating the transcription of these genes. At the same time, some ubiquitin-proteasome-related transcripts were only induced by cadmium treatment but did not react to temperature, also suggesting the existence of a specific mechanism activated by this heavy metal. In addition, we found some metallothionein-related transcripts but did not find clear induction in response to the treatment. The specificity of induction conditions and diversity of these genes also require additional investigation.",

However, prior to these experiments the G. lacustris individuals were acclimated under the conditions of Lake Baikal, i.e. a temperature of 6\u00b0C and in Baikal water. It is possible that the animals already experienced inhibition of ribosomal protein gene expression, and we did not see any response because further down-regulation was not possible. Alternatively, it is possible that the observed characteristics of the transcription profile are inherent for these species. As we did not have a pre-acclimation control or control acclimated in the water from G. lacustris habitat, we could not directly test these hypotheses. Taken together with the results of the interspecies comparison, these results nevertheless allow us to suggest that inhibition of ribosomal protein gene expression is associated with stress response and that gene expression in G. lacustris is already perturbed by acclimation to the conditions of Lake Baikal littoral. Thus, it is possible that the adaptation potential of the former species is not much wider than for Baikal endemics: even though G. lacustris inhabits water bodies with cold water, it is possible that under Baikal conditions it survives for some time but is not fully adapted to them, and thus cannot invade the Lake Baikal littoral in its current state.",

The results indicate that both Baikal species possess intact stress response systems and respond to the stressors with similar changes in their transcription profiles, while the Holarctic species G. lacustris has a less prominent response to both stressors. This result might be explained if Baikal species have specific metabolic adaptations to low temperatures and water composition, while the Holarctic species is not fully adapted to the current conditions of Lake Baikal littoral, and its transcriptome is already perturbed by acclimation.",

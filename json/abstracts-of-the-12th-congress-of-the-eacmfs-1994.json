    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of facial asymmetry and malocclusion in 42 patients who underwent surgical treatment due to muscular torticollis. Tenotomy of the muscle-tendon attachment of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was performed in all cases in the Dept. of Orthopedic Surgery. Average age of patients at the time of operation was 8.5 years. Assessment of the results of surgical treatment was based on the range of movements of the neck and presence of head tilt. Facial asymmetry was evaluated on the basis of clinical examination, photographs, (photostatic) analysis of diagnostic models, anteroposterior skull radiograms and orthopantomograms of the jaws. Severe or moderate facial asymmetry of the mid-and/or lower face was diagnosed in 33 (78.6 %) cases. In 32 (76.2%) of the patients facial asymmetry coexisted with lateral malocclusion (partial anterior crossbite, total lateral occlusion). Based on the findings in this study, we conclude that the degree of facial asymmetry in patients with muscular torticollis is related to timing of surgery and severity of the deformity. There is especially an apparent relationship between lower face asymmetry and coexisting malocclusion.",

Facial asymmetry was evaluated on the basis of clinical examination, photographs, (photostatic) analysis of diagnostic models, anteroposterior skull radiograms and orthopantomograms of the jaws. Severe or moderate facial asymmetry of the mid-and/or lower face was diagnosed in 33 (78.6 %) cases. In 32 (76.2%) of the patients facial asymmetry coexisted with lateral malocclusion (partial anterior crossbite, total lateral occlusion). Based on the findings in this study, we conclude that the degree of facial asymmetry in patients with muscular torticollis is related to timing of surgery and severity of the deformity. There is especially an apparent relationship between lower face asymmetry and coexisting malocclusion.",

In the majority of patients, especially in younger ones, osteopericranial flaps with full thickness parietal bone were used to achieve a satisfactory facial contour, it was also possible, as a one stage procedure, to combine a osteopericranial flap with additional pericranial flaps to correct the most severe facial asymmetries.

The long-term results were analyzed clinically and radiographically, the functional status determined and the mandibular movements recorded simultaneously with electromyography, in 8 patients a condylectomy was performed, while 9 remodelling osteotomies were done. Several patients underwent additional orthognathic procedures and 2 patients were not operated at all. All patients showed late onset of the mandibular deformity and mostly reported a limited duration of the overgrowth. Bone scintigraphy did not seem to be a reliable method to determine the actual pathological growth activity of the condyle. During follow~up, 3 of the patients who underwent condylectomy, had increasing functional complaints. For this reason in one patient condylar reconstruction with a costochondral graft was done.

Based on this experience we suggest the following treatment concept: When feasible the enlarged condyle should be left in situ and one should refrain from surgery until growth activity has ceased.

Males showed significantly higher uptake than females both at high and low uptake sides, and on first and repeat scintigram. Statistical analysis of paired scintigraphic results and standardised measurements of date-matched radiographs showed that ramus length and condylar neck length were significantly larger for the high uptake side, with the ratio of condylar neck to ramus length increasing with the magnitude of isotope uptake on both sides. Ramus length also increases between repeated active scans. The magnitude of uptake on the high uptake side decreases with repeated scans, but no statistical relation is found on the low uptake side. This analysis supports the clinical hypothesis that continued mandibular growth in asymmetry mostly occurs by condylar neck elongation on the affected side, but this is also shown to occur on the normal side in association with a frequently encountered persistent increase in isotope uptake.",

Simulating the surgical procedure, several obstacles could be foreseen: By moving the orbits medially 30 mm, the axis of the optical nerve changed and the most posterior part of the medial orbital wall seemed to exert pressure onto the optical nerve. Therefore, the nerve was freed up to its entrance into the sphenoid bone. The 1/1 postop vision on both eyes seems to justify this effort. Inside the orbit the precise osteotomy lines could be determined prior to surgery. This helped to avoid damage of the middle cranial fossa. The correct amount of medial rotation of the orbits was transmitted from the 3-D model to the patient. Bone grafts and osteosynthesis were placed according to the preoperative model surgery. The postoperative result emphasises the value of this kind of surgical planning.",

These symptoms urge the surgeon to intervene at a very early age. Over the last 10 years it became obvious that radical ostectomy is superior to strip osteotomy in the treatment of craniosynostosis. Radical ostectomy gives rise to normal growth of both the neurocranium and the viscerocranium along with simultaneous release of intracranial pressure. The procedure must be carried out in the first weeks of life to take full advantage of the skull's growth potential and to achieve complete reossification. For craniosynostosis in non-syndrome patients, this one step procedure usually gives complete normalisation of skull growth.

The results of surgery, however, are not always as good as one would hope.

A successful outcome of this kind of surgery is dependent upon the reconstruction of the anterior skull base.

The surgical approach, the amount of resected orbital tissue and the reconstructive procedure have been adapted to the individual needs depending on the location and extend of the tumor. The integration of micro surgical reconstructive techniques has led to marked improvement of functional and esthetic results. Indications, surgical techniques and subsequent results will be presented and discussed in detail.",

Results showed that the human temporalis muscle was supplied by 3 main arteries: the anterior and posterior deep temporal arteries, and middle temporal artery. There was primary, secondary and tertiary branching within each blood supply. Furthermore, multiple anastomosing secondary arteries were noted to connect the 3 main vascular territories.

Depending on the recipient site requirements the flap was used as a galeoperiosteal, galeoosteoperiosteal and galeal skin island flap. When tissue bulk was needed, the flap was folded into to or three layers. A full thickness galeoosteoperiosteal flap was used for mandibular reconstruction and the outer cortex flap for reconstruction of aplastic zygomas or reconstruction of the orbital floor in Treacher-Collins syndrome orbitals. For intraoral reconstruction, the zygomatic arch was cut and swung laterally to facilitate insertion of the flap into the mouth. The flap epithelialized within 2-3 weeks when brought into the mouth. The flap failed in 4 cases for unknown reasons. Advantages of the use of this flap include low donor site morbidity, accessibility (one operative field), reliability and versatility.

Larger defects, particularly after irradiation, require micro vascular repair. In case of bone defects only, vascularized fibular grafts are preferred. In combined soft tissue and bony defects scapular bone grafts and parascapular flaps are commonly used. There is no ideal method of reconstruction but rigid fixation combined with (vascularized) bone grafts seems to be satisfactorily. Cancellous iliac crest bone as well as microanastomosed fibula and scapula grafts ca n easily be fixed with reconstruction plates. The blood supply of microvascular grafts is usually not impaired when using functionally stable AO-reconstruction plate fixation (THORP\u00ae). On the contrary, this procedure seems to protect the anastomoses and to promote uneventful healing. Loosening of plates and screws which can occur using functionally unstable fixation systems are not common in our patient group.",

The ageing face requires correction of every anatomical component i.e. facial skeleton, dento-alveolar part and soft tissues. The surgical armamentarium includes : maxillofacial osteotomies, autogenous bone grafts, biomaterials, internal rigid fixation and other ancillary procedures. The introduction of endosseous implants has allowed the surgeon to use a stable base on which a prosthesis can be made with functional and aesthetic long-lasting results. Last, but not least, repositioning of the facial mask is the 'final touch' for these complex reconstructive procedures. The concept of TFR may be considered as an evolution of reconstructive surgery.

Herniation of the orbital content to the maxillary sinus, through a orbital floor defect, pulls the globe downwards and backwards, resulting in enophthalmus. Entrapment of the orbital content in the fractured area wilt cause diplopia, mainly due to restriction of the inferior rectus muscle. Various materials and approaches for reconstruction of the orbital floor have been suggested in the literature. The purpose of this presentation is to report our experience. Forty five orbital floor reconstructions were performed in our department between the years 1989-1993. Three different materials have been used-lyodura (lyophilised dura) in 27 cases, silastic sheath in 13 cases and calvarian bone in 5 cases. Three different approaches were used -infra-orbital, sub-ciliary or through the existing laceration. None of the three materials caused infection and none had to be removed. When diplopia was observed as one of the presenting pre surgical symptoms it disappeared within 6 months except for one case. The lyodura was found to be the easiest material to be From 1980 to 1992 142 patients with eyelid ptosis (29 bilateral, 113 unilateral) were operated upon. The age of the patients ranged from 2 to 52 years, including 101 (71.1%) children up to 15 years. The cause of eyelid ptosis was congenital in 127 (89.4 %) cases, post traumatic in 13 cases (9.25) and postoperative complications in 2 patients (1.4 %). Preoperative examination consisted of routine ophthalmological examination (including visual acuity), measurements of palpebral fissures, pupil exposure and function of the levator muscle. The method of treatment was chosen on the basis of aesthetic and functional needs. 102 patients (71.8 %) were treated by the Berke method, in 34 patients (24.0 %) an eyelid suspension by strips of temporal fascia or fascia lata was performed. Six patients with Marcus-Gunn syndrome were operated according to the Neuhaus method. Results of treatment were evaluated 12 months after the surgical procedure. Very good results (symmetrical palpebral fissures, exposed pupils) were obtained in 88 patients (62.0%), adequate results in 47 patients (33.1%)and poor results in 7 patients (4.9 %)",

Overall success rate for arthroscopic lysis and lavage was 21 joints (50%). Joints with arthroscopic diagnosis of pronounced synovitis responded best to surgery (8 of 12 joints, 67 %). All 21 joints regarded non successful, were operated with diskectomy without implants. Success rate at 1-year follow-up was 18 joints (86 %). In general arthroscopic disc traction suture (ADTS) procedures are used in the treatment of early stages of internal derangement or recurrent mandibular dislocation of the TMJ. Common ADTS procedures are based on a partially visualised technique and share a major limitation due to the anatomical structure of the TMJ, limited manoeuvring space and visibility. Results of the suture interfering with nerves, arteries, and veins are discussed and a classification of the facial nerve network is presented. Several complicating possibilities include facial paralysis, disturbance of vascularity and decreased range of motion.",

Although it concerns a small group of patients with short follow-up, this technique, however, seems to have a place in TMJ treatment. H. F. Zeilhofer, R. Sader, H. Deppe, H. H. Horch, B. Kling Dept. of OMF Surgery, Miinich, Germany Ultrasound imaging of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) has been a problem due to the lower frequency of the transducers used. Imaging of TMJ structures useful for diagnosis and therapy was only possible through timeconsuming and expensive radiological image yielding procedures (CT, MRI). 84 TMJ's in 42 patients were examined clinically, radiographically, by axiographic tracing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging with a high frequency 13MHz transducer. The image sequences in functional condylar movement were taped via a video output into a film recorder. Selected ultrasound images could then be fed into a personal computer and evaluated. By ultrasound imaging the joint space could be measured and compared with the space measured in the MRI; the value determined by ultrasonography was 10 times more exact. The computer supported image analysis of the condylar movements led to a presentation of the condylar pathway. The sonographically determined condylar guidance corresponded to the value traced by axiography with high significance within a range of 3 degrees. The TMJ disc could be localised just as exactly as with MRI. The use of a 13 MHz transducer offers a new low-cost method of non invasive dynamic imaging of important TMJ structures. The possibility of video and computer support enables movement analysis and opens new possibilities in the morphological and functional evaluation of the TMJ. The most frequently seen temporomandibular disorder is called internal derangement. The evaluation of different stages of internal derangement, however, involves a number of problems. The purpose of this study was to detect pathological findings with a new system of high-resolution single photon emission computertomography (Multispect 3, SIEMENS, equipped with an Ultrahigh-Resolution-Collimator), and to compare the results with those obtained via magnetic resonance tomography . Therefore, a total of 30 patients (60 joints) suffering from internal derangement of the TMJ were examined with a high-field (1.5 Tesla) MRTsystem (Magnetom SP 4000, SIEMENS) and sequentiallywithin a period of 6 days-with the SPECT-system. The results of this investigation indicate a good correlation of MRT-and SPECT-findings in the later stages of internal derangement. The potential value of high-resolution single photon emission computertomography seems to, be its detection of minimal osseous changes i~a the early stages of internal derangemen t . The sample of this study, however, is too small to present definitive conclusions. According to an array of priorities functional deficits in cleft lip and palate patients are more important than aesthetic disturbances. Respecting this basic statement, the Frankfurt cleft lip and palate team changed the surgical schedule for closure of the cleft 10 years before to early functional surgery, implying: first operation at approx. 3 months of age including: a) intravelar veloplasty, b) ear tubes, c) closure of the alveolar cleft, d) lip adhesion. Second operation at 5-6 months of age: definite lip and nose surgery. Third operation at 1-1.5 year of age: closure of the hard palate.",

Furthermore, the use of alloplastic materials to be modelled intraoperatively may result in inflammatory tissue response. Therefore, the question was raised whether computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM-techniques) may be used for the preoperative geometric contouring. Helical CT data is used to create a 3-dimensional model of the defect skull. This numerically based model serves as the basis for a freeform surface design of the implant's shape, position and thickness. The data required for this geometric contouring are derived from the structures neighbouring the defect. Modelling tools and programs developed for industrial CAD/CAM are used. The precise and individual fit of the implant results from generating its margins by the margins of the defect whereas the implant's surface is generated by the geometry of the non-affected neighbouring bone contours. The computer-based geometric data of the implant then numerically control a milling machine to fabricate the individual implant. The reconstruction of post traumatic contour-defects of the forehead and of temporal defects after surgery for intracranial bleedings are presented as the first clinical experiences of this new method.",

The choice of intra-oral reconstruction with jejunum free flap was related to the dimension of the superficial defect and the general health of the patient. The free radial forearm flap was generally used for the elderly with poor general condition. The authors report their experience. The rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap consists of a skin paddle, anterior rectus sheath, rectus abdominis and deep inferior epigastric artery and veins. Thickness of skin paddle, anterior rectus sheath and volume of rectus muscle can be adjusted appropriately to accommodate the needs. Various designs of this flap are available and they can classified into the following four basic patterns; Pattern I (Pectoralis major flap type), Pattern II (Extended type), Pattern III (Muscle diminished flap) and Pattern IV (Skin thinning type). Combinations of these patterns are also possible. Eighteen patients underwent oral and maxillofacial reconstruction after tumor ablation using the rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. Ten cases of tongue defect, two cases of hemifacial contour deficiency, two oropharyneal defects, two cheek defects including buccal mucosa, and one lower gingiva and hard and soft palate defect. In this series, there were seven cases of Pattern I, three Pattern II, three Pattern III and five combinations of Patterns III and IV. It can be concluded that the rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap in a very reliable flap for oral and maxillofacial reconstruction. An overall of 53 from 565 transplants (9.4 %) suffered from circulatory disorders. There was a significant influence on transplant perfusion by abuse of alcohol, liver diseases, lung diseases and diabetes mellitus. Due to intervention in right time, 30 transplants could be saved while 23 microsurgical (5.2%) and 3 pedicled (2.5%) transplants could not be saved. Circulatory disorders of microsurgical transplants appeared in only 4.8 % of non smokers whilst it appeared in smokers in 15.6%, in patients with coronary heart diseases in 16.6 % and in patients with lung diseases in 23.3 %. Preoperative irradiation had no significant influence on transplant circulation. Nevertheless, with a higher irradiation dose a rise of prolongued wound healing, dehiscents and infections appeared. Jejunal transplants showed lower reactivity than myocutaneous flaps, i.e. at doses of more than 60 Gys, wound healing disorders of jejunal transplants appeared in 15.4 %, since they appeared in 34.6% of myocutaneous flaps. Pedicled flaps showed a higher rate of wound healing disorders with liver-and lung diseases (32.2%) than microsurgical transplants (11.9 %). The donor sites showed similar results. Liver diseases and diabetes mellitus were associated with a significant rise of wound healing disorders after harvest of myocutaneous flaps.",

Insertion of endosseous dental implants enables adequate rehabilitation of these patients, From 1988 to 1994 37 patients with tumor caused partial loss of the mandible have been supplied with t62 implants (Bone-Lock, Leibinger, D-Freiburg) for final rehabilitation. In 25 patients a preoperative combined irradiation and chemotherapy was given. After tumor resection and partial resection of the mandible 23 patients have been supplied with a microsurgical revascularized small bowel transplant, 3 with a flap from pectoralis major muscle and 1 patient with a flap from the latissimus dorsi muscle to cover the intraoral defect. 31 patients have been reconstructed with autologous bone grafts (26 x free non-revascularized iliac crest, 5 x microsurgical revascularized scapula, 1 x free rib). The time between tumor operation and reconstruction amounted to 22 months average and between reconstruction and insertion of implants 15 months on average. In one case we achieved reconstruction and implantation simultaneously. 21 to the 162 inserted implants had to be removed, 4 implants could not be integrated into the prosthetic suprastructure because of unfavourable localisation (success rate 88.7 %). 2 patients (8 implants) had to be counted as a drop-out. 25 patients are finally supplied with an overdenture. Parameters of the periimplant gingiva of tumor patients like Hygiene-Index, Gingiva-Index, Sulcus-Bleeding-Index and pocket-provingdepth showed significant worse results in comparison with non tumor patients. Periimplant bone resorption however progressed significant slower. From a subjective and objective point of view functional rehabilitation of tumor patients with dental implants is often limited, for aesthetic and social rehabilitation, however, it gains outstanding importance.",

P The introduction of adequate internal fixation by means of screws and plates and the better understanding of the healing pattern of bone under different conditions has tremendously changed our treatment approach, not only in general but especially in relation to acutely and chronically infected fractures. While until a few years ago in acutely infected fractures the first treatment steps were drainage, antibiotics and intermaxillary fixation or external pin fixation, today our approach is immediate, adequate stable internal fixation with plates and screws together with drainage and antibiotics. This treatment approach is especially helpful in view of the rising number of uncooperative patients like in geriatrics or alcoholics and drug addicts. This kind of treatment is very cost effective although at first glance it may not appear to be that way. During this presentation we will present our experience over the last 10 years. The technical background of the operative procedure is explained, the question of immediate bone grafting is discussed and a statistical overview is presented.",

All of the cervical injuries occurred in the subgroup of patients with facial trauma following road traffic accidents (n = 94)~ resulting in an incidence in this subgroup of 6.1%. All 6 patients had multiple injuries and facial lacerations and 5 had mandibular fractures. All 5 conscious patients complained of neck stiffness or pain. Only 2 of the six cervical fractures were observed on standard three-view plain cervical radiographs (two fractures of C2). Both these fractures were seen on computed tomography (CT) with two further fractures (body of C4 and body of C7). Two patients had fractures that were diagnosable only on stress views under radiographic screening (subluxations of C4/C5 and C5/C6). This study illustrates the need for a high index of suspicion of associated cervical injury in patients with facial fractures, especially following high velocity type injury. It also illustrates that negative plain radiographs may require further radiographic investigation (CT or stress views) and it high-lights the limitations of CT in the diagnosis of ligamentous injury of the cervical spine where stress views under radiographic screening of the spine are of value.",

A Gillies incision was the commonest surgical approach used to reduce the fractured malar. This was followed by fixation frequently with transnasal Kirschner wires. In the majority of unstable cases internal fixation was applied using bone plates at the fronto-zygomatic suture and/or at the zygomatic buttress. Silicone rubber sheeting was used to support the herniated orbital contents in blow out fracture. The methods used for assessment of infra orbital sensory disturbance are presented.

However, there were significant differences in the causes and location of the fractures between groups A + B and C + D. The proportion of condylar fractures decreased and the proportion of body and angle fractures increased with increasing age; fractures in the horizontal part of the mandible were mainly observed in groups C and D.

The studygroup comprised of 599 patients with maxillofacial fractures treated in our department between the years 1985-1992. Out of these patients, 13 required tracheostorny. Of these, 6 patients had cricothyroidectomy on arrival. Of the remaining 7 patients, 3 required tracheostomy because of airway obstruction, 3 due to respiratory distress, and 1 due to difficulty in intubation. The other 586 patients maintained free airway and non of them developed a late airway obstruction. We conclude that surgical securing of the airway may play an important role in the overall management of patients with facial trauma. The choice of surgical securing of the airway, versus endotracheal intubation is an individual one. In view of the improved endotracheal intubation techniques and the use of rigid internal fixation for the treatment of facial fractures, the need for surgical procedures to secure the airway is not as common as in the past.",

No correlation (Spearman RC) could be found between the amount and direction of the maxillary repositioning, and the change in alar width or tip projection. This lead to the conclusion that an alar cinch suture might be inadequate, and that other factors than skeletal movements might play a role. We also frequently observed postoperative decrease of nasal tip projection and rotation after a combined maxillary osteotomy and rhinoplasty. Two nasal tip support mechanisms are disrupted by a standard Le Fort I-type osteotomy i.e. : the attachments of the medial foot plates to the caudal border of the nasal septum (major) and the anterior spine (minor).

Our preliminary results suggest that wire-osteosynthesis behaves like semi-rigid osteosynthesis with prevailing advantages when used in onepiece impactions and moderate maxillary advancements. Between 1989-1993 36 patients with facial asymmetry were evaluated. Some of them underwent a correction including a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). The BSSO was done according to the technique of Hunsuck. In 3 cases a bad split could not be prevented at the side towards the deviation. 3-D CT reconstruction revealed that in facial asymmetry the ascending ramus at the side towards the deviation had a different anatomical structure as compared to non-asymmetry patients. Both the deviation of the mandibular angle towards the midline, the shape and the bone volume of the ascending ramus behind the mandibular canal, make the Hunsuck-technique less desirable. The fracture using the Hunsuck-technique is usually located directly behind the mandibular foramen. In facial asymmetry cases, however, the distal fragment usually tends to fracture up to the condyle instead of fracturing at the lingula, causing a bad split with a large buccal fragment. In all cases of bad split rigid fixation could be achieved.",

In most of these cases malocclusion is the result sometimes giving rise to functional problems. The correction of transverse discrepancies depends on the localisation and the severity of the deformity in the maxillary arch. Simple discrepancies can be corrected orthodontically, sometimes after surgically assisted expansion. Unilateral deformities are best corrected by hemimaxillary osteotomies, with a high relapse tendency being considered in cases of cleft palate deformities. Bilateral transverse discrepancies of the anterior part of the maxilla with widening or narrowing of the alveolar arch can be treated by anterior maxillary osteotomies. If the whole maxilla is too wide or too narrow Le fort I osteotomies are required with segmentalisation. In these particular situations it is important to take the blood supply of the maxillary segments into consideration; thus modified incisions for narrowing or widening of the anterior or whole maxilla have to be carried out.

Data from 438 female and 198 male patients with an average age of 27.0 years were available and statistically evaluated on a survey form that included 78 parameters. Altogether 134 maxillary, 313 mandibular and 189 combined maxillary/mandibular osteotomies were carried out, whereby Cefotaxim (74.4%), Cefamandol (10.8%), Ceftriaxon (5.4%), Cefotiam (2.8%) Piperacillin (2.7%) and others (3.9 %) were administrated perioperatively. Shortterm prophylaxis (with an antibiotic dose of 48 h) was carried out in 48.4 % of the patients, long-term prophylaxis with an average duration of 6.0 d in 51.6%. Wound dehiscences were found in 8.9% of all operations and wound infections with established pus secretion in 3.1%. Wound infections were observed in only 1.5% of the maxillary osteotomies, but in 4.8 % of the mandibular osteotomies and in 1.6 % of the combined operations. The antibiotic selection as well as antibiotic dosage duration did not have any significant influence. Only subsequent to mandibular osteotomies did a significantly higher number of wound infections occur because of wound dehiscences. The wound dehiscence rate proved to be both dependent on the method of operation as well as on its extent, as 12.2% of the combined maxillary/mandibular osteotomies revealed dehiscences while only 5.1% of the mandibular osteotomies had wound dehiscences. As the results of Singer (1983) , Balan (1984) and Mfihling et. al. (1984) have shown, the low infection rate in this investigation confirms the effectiveness of a perioperative antibiotic treatment. Since the infection rate cannot be additionally reduced by longterm prophylaxis, but rather the appearance of resistant micro flora is encouraged, we consider short-term perioperative treatment of 48 h the method of choice.",

The previously used surgical approach according to Spiessl showed in 5% of the patients dysfunction of the facial nerve. The technique was therefore modified to a dissection above the platysma up to a level more cranial than the marginal branch of the facial nerve. At operation an electrical nerve stimulator is used. After dissecting to the fascia of the masseter muscle, the marginal branch of the facial nerve will be seen. The muscle is divided cranial of the nerve and is then subperiostally elevated from the angle up to the fracture of the condylar neck. With this technique no damage to the facial nerve is done.",

The main advantages of this micro plate system are the malleability which allows adaptation to the anatomical bone contour and the adequate stability as compared with wire fixation.

While the loss of the malar prominence may be corrected by osteotomy or onlay grafts, it is still difficult to correct diplopia or enophthalmus. Before reconstruction it is important to know the size and location of the bony defects in the orbital cone. With stereo lithography a three-dimensional model of the orbits and the midface can be manufactured. This shows especially defects of the medial wall and the roof of the orbit. The decision to reconstruct the medial wall for correction of enophthalmus is more often indicated than suspected previously. Since 1992 we corrected 8 patients with enophthalmus or diplopia by reconstruction of 2 or 3 walls of the orbit. In 3 patients a correction of the zygoma was necessary.

In nine (9) of these children the following tests were performed during the acute phaseof the disease: a) measurement of T and B cells and of T cell sub populationin peripheral blood, b) measurement of IgA, IgM, IgG and IgE in serum,c) neutrophil function tests in blood, nitrobluetetrazolium screening test,chemotaxis and opsonization test, d) determination of the following acutephase proteins in serum: C-reactive protein (CRP), al-antitrypsin, C3,C4, haptoglobin, and coeruloplasmin, e) determination of autoantibodiesin serum, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-DNA, SS-A, SS-B, rheumatoidfactors (RFs) and cardiolipin antibodies and f) detection of antiviralantibodies, parotitis, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes and adenoviruses. The results were: 2 children had very low IgAvalues. In all children CRP was up to 10 times higher than normal and C3was up to 40 % higher than normal. In all fourteen cases antiviral antibodieswere found. All the remaining immunological parameters were within normalrange. The presence of antiviral antibodies in all cases implies a possible correlation of the JRP to infections due to viruses. They possibly destroy the glandular or lymphoepithelial tissue and secondarily affect the ductalsystem and thus the consistency of saliva. Craniofacial disorders may give rise to SRBD because of upper airway obstructions. This may cause apnoea with the resulting consequences such as excessive somnolence during day time, growth retardation, etc. At present there are only a few hospitals where cardiorespiratory polygraphy (CP) is used in children.

In more than 36 cases the inferior alveolar nerve was visible at operation. It was usually visible when the canal was located apicolingually, lingually and between the roots. The nerve was usually not visible when the canal was located buccally. Radical surgery is generally accepted as the best means to cure patients with oral carcinoma. Recently, new techniques have been developed, including free transfers with micro vascular anastomosis. This enables the surgeon to reconstruct the oro-facial region even in cases with large defects. It was hypothetized that these new developments would have a beneficial effect on the cure rate of patients with large tumours. For this reason the data of the Central Tumour Registry of the DI3SAK (German Austrian Swiss Cooperative Group on tumours of the maxillofacial region) were examined.",

The patients were examined by qualified speech therapists with the Frenchay Dysartria Assessment (Enderby 1981) as well as with various other means developed especially for the adequacy of motor speech functions, speech intelligibility and swallowing. All patients claimed that, immediately after the operation, they had speech difficulties. At the time of the present study all but two still had articulation deficits and/or hyper nasality as well as subjective incompetence in speech which had even resulted in withdrawal from social contacts. The degree of speech defect was estimated as moderate or severe in four patients. A significant positive correlation was found between age of patients and degree of speech defect. The correlation between speech deficit and follow-up time or extent of resection was not significant. The patients' ability to spontaneously compensate their speech deficits seemed to vary considerably. The results show that long lasting speech disorders are very common in patients who have undergone oral cancer surgery. Since these patients did not receive speech therapy, the quality of life may have been greatly affected because of poor compensatory abilities in untreated patients. We recommend that all such patients should be seen by speech therapist for appropriate treatment.",

Undecalcified bone sections of the resected areas and the biopsies were used to find out a correlation between the bone turnover, the scintigraphy, radiographical and clinical findings. It could be shown, that after radiation the bone turnover is extremely reduced. Mineralisation in the Haveric systems is absent. There is no trabecular organisation. The spongious areas show fatty degeneration. Revitalisation of the radiated bone begins slowly, after years, from the periphery. Even after 10 years this process could go on.

Mucositis is often dose-limiting, and may thus have a negative effect on curative cancer treatment. It has been reported that aerobic Gram-negative bacilli can aggravate mucositis. It is also known that 0.1% chlorhexidine rinses were neither successful in controlling Gram-negative bacilli nor in reducing mucositis. This prospective, randomised controlled study reports the effect of PTA-lozenges containing 2 mg polymyxin E, 1.8 mg tobramycin and 10 mg amphotericin B on the prevention of mucositis. The PTA-lozenges were prescribed four times daily, starting on the first day of irradiation. The results in 15 comparably irradiated patients using PTA-lozenges were evaluated by comparing with 2 groups of 15 patients rinsing with chlorhexidine 0.1% or placebo. Eradication of Gram-negative bacilli and yeasts was achieved within 3 weeks in the PTA-group, whereas no effect on these flora was determined in the chlorhexidine and placebo group (pFCX A0.01, student t-test). The severity and extent of mucositis was reduced in PTA-lozenges group as compared to the other two groups (p < 0.05, student ttest). All patients in the PTA-group showed erythema only. In both the chlorhexidine and placebo rinsing group 80 % suffered severe mucositis with extended pseudo membranes.

Major symptoms of metastatic tumors requiring further diagnostic interventions are pain, swelling, bleeding and ulceration and neurological disturbances. We report our experience with 30 patients with metastatic tumors in the head and neck region seen in the period from 1980 to 1993. There were 17 males and 13 females ranging in age from 29 to 89 years (median age 64 years). Metastatic tumors were localised as follows: mandible (16), maxilla (5), soft tissue (7) and maxillary sinus (2). Metastases originated from primary tumors of different location, with breast carcinoma (6) being the most frequently reported tumor. In the majority of cases palliative therapy including surgery as well as chemo-and radiotherapy is the treatment of choice. Even in a palliative setting surgical interventions including mandibular resection and functional reconstruction is warranted. A close interdisciplinary management of these patients is mandatory. ",

Although joining two vessels of markedly different diameters is often a fact in the clinical situation, none of these anastomotic systems seem to be designed to cope with this fact. The presented system can be used to connect vessels with high calibre discrepancy. The system is resorbable and consists of a cuff and a shrinkable sleeve. The 'shrinkingfeature' of the cuff allows a high adaptability to the various diameters. To carry out the anastomosis the vessel end with the smaller diameter is pulled through the cuff and everted over it. The sleeve is pulled over the end of the larger vessel, and this vessel is then slipped over the everted smaller vessel.",

Madrid, Spain Microvascular free tissue transfer has provided a variety of methods of restoring defects created by tumour resection, infection or trauma. During the past 2 years, 15 patients have undergone 16 free flaps for mandibular reconstruction, 7 for squamous cell carcinoma, 2 for sarcomas involving the mandible, 2 for ameloblastoma, and 4 for other reasons. Primary reconstruction was performed in 10 patients and secondary reconstruction in patients. The flaps utilizated were 12 iliac crest, 3 scapula, and 1 radial fasciocutaneous flap combined with iliac crest flap. Five patients had received radiotherapy prior to surgery and 2 postoperatively. In order to restore masticatory function, endosseous implants were inserted at the time of reconstruction. Osseointegration has been successful in all cases. There have been no problems associated with radiotherapy. Dental implants in scapular flaps did not appear to be successful. The most important drawback of the iliac crest flap is the bulky skin paddle and its limited mobility. To solve this problem, we have used local flaps (tongue), regional flaps (bilateral nasolabial flap), combined free flaps (radial forearm flap) and internal oblique muscle flaps based on the deep circumflex iliac artery and vein. There were 2 total flap losses in patients using an iliac crest graft and a partial bone loss in 1 scapular flap. Bone scans were obtained within the first 5 days. Recipient site complications included 3 infections (2 of them associated with flap necrosis), 1 oral fistula, and 1 intraoral bone exposure that healed after conservative therapy. Donor site complications only included 1 seroma and in 9 patients temporary or permanent anesthesia of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, that was transected in the majority of cases.",

In recent years prosthetic devices using various alloplastic materials have increasingly been used to treat disease of the temperomandibular joint (TMJ). This study reports the results of both clinical studies and mechanical stress testing of the Christensen TMJ prosthesis system. Clinical studies were done on three groups of patients as follows: 1) placement of a glenoid fossa-eminence prosthesis with retention of the meniscus (23 patients-41 joints), 2) placement of a glenoid fossa-eminence prosthesis without retention of the meniscus (27 patients-50 joints), 3) total joint replacement (22 patients-35 joints).",

To achieve full reconstruction with the allogeneic graft, it was attached to the proximal end of an other graft prepared from a cortical plate at which attachments of the pterygoid muscle were still intact (8 cases).

Surgical treatment of this condition is often indicated when the patient complains of functional or related psychosocial impairment, such as a reduced chewing ability, social restrictions (a.o. eating with small cutlery, kissing problems), and hampered dental care and oral hygiene. The aim of this study was to describe the diagnostic procedures, treatment planning, surgical technique and post-operative care in patients suffering from pseudoankylosis. In six patients (1 female, 5 male; mean age 23_+7 years, range 15-33 years) TMJ pseudoankylosis was treated by unilateral (2 cases) or bilateral (4 case) coronoidectomy. Post-operative physical therapy was applied on a daily basis for the first week and continued once per week for at least 3 weeks. In 3 cases a dynamic bite opener was used. The results show that radiological screening with CT or MRI was always needed to differentiate between intra-and extra-capsular TMJ ankylosis in addition to clinical examination and conventional plain radiography. In one case examination under general anaesthesia had to be performed to assure the diagnosis. In all cases coronoidectomy was preferred to myotomy or brisement forc6, because of the change to create again fibrosis. Maximum mouthopening increased from 15_+ 7 mm preoperatively to 41 + 10 mm six months postoperatively (p < 0.01, paired t-test). This study shows that dissection of the coronoid process is a reliable method to release pseudoankylosis if immediate postoperative physical therapy is instituted. ",

HBO increases the oxygen available to hypoxic or anoxic tissue. Furthermore, HBO enhances healing by inducing fibroblastic proliferation and capillary formation in bone and soft tissue. During the period 1981-1991 we used a monoplace hyperbaric chamber and since 1992 a multiplace hyperbaric chamber for HBO treatments. HBO was given at 2.5-2.8 ATA for 90 -120 minutes, once per day. We have used 5-7 preoperative and 5-7 postoperative sessions. In the present series altogether 18 patients suffering from osteoradionecrosis of the mandible or maxilla were treated with surgery and HBO. The surgical therapy consisted of decortication of the infected bone whereafter this bone area was covered with a free periosteal transplant from the tibia. The shortest follow up time is now over 9 months and 17 of the 18 patients treated are free of symptoms. We conclude that HBO-therapy is a promising adjunctive method to surgery in the treatment of mandibular or maxillary osteoradionecrosis.",

Angelopoulos Dept. of MF Surgery and Ophthalmology, Greek Anticancer Institute, University of Athens, Greece Malignant tumors of the orbit and the orbitomaxillary area are relatively uncommon constituting less than 10 % of head and neck malignancies. Their management often requires extensive mutilating procedures and poses diverse problems with regard to reconstruction. During the years 1990-1993, 35 patients with orbitomaxillary and orbital malignancies were treated surgically. Tumors arose from the lids, the globe or some part of the orbital contents or invaded the orbit from the maxillary antrum or the ethmoids. Surgical treatment varied from simple orbital exenteration, exenteration to include the eyelids and the skin of the eyebrow, to hemimaxillectomies with orbital exenteration and nasoorbital-cranial approaches. Immediate reconstruction followed in all cases and included skin grafting and the use of median forehead and temporalis flaps. There were no intraor immediate post-operative deaths. Twenty patients were treated with post-operative radiotherapy and 5 with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Tumors recurred in 10 cases that received additional palliative treatment only. Recurrences occurred during the first post-operative year. Seven patients died from distant metastases or intracranial involvement. Diagnostic methods and prognostic criteria are presented and the reconstructive procedures are discussed. It is concluded that except from broad guidelines that determine the operability of the tumors, the surgical treatment of orbital and orbitomaxillary malignancies should be individualised. Ferrara, Italy, ** Dept. of Maxillofacial Surgery, S. Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy At present, osteotomies are generally used to gain access to areas of the face that hitherto were not easily reachable. The technique of dismantling and reassembling of facial bones has previously been described by the authors. In some cases, however, where the fragments were not pedicled to the soft tissues, resorption was noted. For this reason methods have been developed in our institution to ensure adequate blood supply to the bony fragments. Apart from the earlier described 'Maxillo-Cheek flap' two more such flaps have been used i.e. the 'Nasal-Cheek flap' and the 'Nasal-Maxillo-Cheek flap'. The three flaps may be combined in selected cases.",

The invasive pattern of disease was evident at a much shallower depth in the molar region of the mandible (mean 9 mm), compared to the premolar and parasymphyseal region (mean 25 ram).

To evaluate a homogenous group of patients the results achieved in 1 l consecutive patients operated by one and the same surgeon are presented, 7 of these patients were females and 4 males. The youngest patient was 41, the oldest 66 years of age with an average of 54 years. Six or 9 Branemark fixtures were inserted into the maxilla, a total of 80 implants. 66 of these fixtures were inserted after pretapping, 14 were self tapping fixtures. 22 fixtures were used in combination with BMP (bone morphogenetic protein), 8 of these after pretapping, 14 were selftapping. 32 fixtures were placed in the front region and 48 fixtures were placed in the premolar and molar region. After an average observation time of 3 years (ranging from 1 year 8 months to 5 years and 6 months) 77 fixtures (= 96.25 %) were still in place, 2 (= 2.5%) were lost, one firm and integrated fixture was removed 18 months postoperatively, because it was not used. The two losses occurred in female patients. It is important to state that these 2 fixtures were not totally firm when placed, but left as a trial. The presented method enables the surgeon to improve the intermaxillary relationship and to restore the original facial dimensions in a vertical and sagittal plane.

The technique developed by Sailer (1987) is a modification of the interpositional procedure proposed by Schettler in 1967. The lingual pedicled cranial part of the mandible is positioned superiorly and a bicortical iliac bone graft is interpositioned. In the same session implants of maximal length are inserted into the pedicled cranial part through the interpositioned bone graft into the symphyseal cortex. Before the insertion bovine Bone Morphogenetic Protein (b-BMP) is put into the burr holes. The interforaminal procedure is combined with the classical onlay technique in the lateral part of the mandible, posterior to the mental foramina, in order to assure an adequate mandibular contour. Simultaneous sulcoplasties are possible. After six months of healing in the meantime the patients existing mandibular denture is relined for temporary use the abutment procedure is carried out, and the fabrication of a definitive fixed or detachable mandibular prosthesis is started. Depending on the number of implants a bar or precision attachments can be used to support the prosthesis. In a retrospective study 23 patients were evaluated . The method creates excellent recipient sites for maximum sized endosseous implants. The longest follow-up period was 5 years, and the success rate 98.7 %. One implant of 78 failed to osseointegrate. The total resorption after a period of two years compared with the absolute height of the augmentation was 16% in the anterior region and 17% respectively in the lateral part of the mandible, Most of the patients were highly satisfied with their facial form and denture function. This sandwich technique is also indicated for post-traumatic reconstruction with loss of the anterior alveolar crest. In cases of extreme atrophy of the lateral aspects of the mandible, a posterior sandwich procedure can be performed.",

Secure soft tissue coverage of these grafts is of major importance. Local flaps have often to be employed due to scarring or loss of soft tissue.

The results in all patients were functionally and esthetically good 8, 6, 4 and 3 years after operation, respectively. However, considerable resorption (at least 50 %) occurred in 2 patients, one with autologous bone chips and one without. The last patient had gradual loss of various sequesters over a period of 6 years. No significant late resorption was observed in 3 patients irrespective of the addition of autologous bone. The most remarkable results were seen in the 2 BMP patients, both with large lyophilised bone grafts comprising of parts of body and ramus, which intraoperatively were generously covered with BMP paste. In 1 case the lyo-bone was additionally impregnated with BMP before operation. The observation period was 20 and 6 months, respectively. Both grafts were rapidly integrated without signs of resorption, suggesting accelerated autologous substitution induced by BMP.

Two patients underwent primary reconstruction, in 8 patients the reconstruction was done secondarily, 1 to 5 years after tumor surgery. All patients were treated with preoperative radiation and/or chemotherapy. The 3-D models of the skull were produced by laserlithography. For the bony reconstruction 8 iliac crest, 1 fibular and 1 scapular grafts were used. In order to outline the advantages of the preoperative model planning, 2 groups could be defined. In primary reconstruction the design and adaptation of the osteosynthesis material would have been difficult when the tumor was located in the bone and would have led to deformation of the bony contours. In case of secondary reconstruction the dislocated resection stumps of the mandible could be well assessed. Preoperative model surgery made it possible to redefine the correct midline, and to reposition the displaced condyles. This allowed a exact preoperative design of the osteosynthesis material and a perfect calculation of the size and configuration of the bone graft. In conclusion, preoperative model surgery facilitated the surgical management and proved to be a time saving factor in these patients.",

A'-series of 35 neoplasms lying deep to the facial nerve, including tumours arising in the deep of the parotid and parapharyngeal space were seen in the period December 1971-1994. Those tumours which were operable were managed by either a trans cervical approach or following a preliminary parotidectomy and mobilisation of the facial nerve. Only 4 tumours required access mandibulotomy and a further 2 tumours were referred to a colleague (Mr. Marcus Atlas) for management by the Fisch Type' C' approach.

Miinster, Germany Retrospective immunohistochemical studies on putative prognostic markers in oral malignancies have been hindered by the shortage of antibodies reactive on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues and/or proper antigen demasking methods. Having recently introduced the wet autoclave pre treatment for antigen retrieval in archival human material we could perform an immunohistochemical analysis on the expression of several antigens. We have selected a homogeneous group of 23 patients with SCC of the floor of the mouth and tongue, clinical stage T2NOM0 (UICC), treated by surgery alone. Since the histopathological assessment of the tumor (well-, moderately-, poorly differentiated, grade I III) is not an adequate prognostic indicator, we characterised the invading front of the tumors. This might give more information on the aggressive spreading capacity of the cancer with a possible influence on clinical outcome. The overexpression of p53 oncoprotein was investigated with a panel of anti-p53 antibodies (CM1, DO7, PAbl801, PAb240). The rate of proliferation (with MoAb MIB-1 and AgNORs) was determined and the reactivity of the tumor cells with monoclonal antibodies to metallothionein was examined -which is reported to play a predictive role in the assessment of biological aggressiveness. Bcl-2 oncoprotein -exerting regulatory effect on the life span of tumor cells was also determined. A statistical analysis of the clinicopathological parameters in relation to survival was carried out showing no significant correlation between p53 overexpression, rate of proliferation, grade of the tumors and survival.",

However, the origin of the epithelial cells initiating the healing process and the nature of the epithelialization of the flap remains unknown. The objective of this study is to elucidate the factors involved in this epithelialization process. 32 cats have undergone partial maxillectomy and immediate reconstruction with temporalis myofascial flap. They were sacrificed at defined post-surgical intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18 and 24 weeks. The reconstructed maxillae were analysed in 8 cats by a combination of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. All cats had uncomplicated healing of the flaps and the reconstructed palate was eventually lined with a smooth mucosa without rugae at 24 weeks. The epithelialization process was found to be initiated from the wound margins and the neo-epithelial cells advanced over the granulating myofascial surface with eventual coverage of the whole flap. No nidus of epithelial cells was noted on the granulating surface. The regenerated mucosa was parakeratinised stratified squamous epithelium with a distinct ultra-surface feature, which is quite different from the normal palate. In conclusion, the healing of the temporalis myofascial flap in the mouth is by secondary intention rather than by shedded mucosal cells with multifocal epithelialization.",

Kriimer Dept. of OMF Surgery, University of K6ln, Germany Hyperplastic lesions of the oral mucosa such as leukoplakia and oral lichen planus can eventually develop into squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and provide an excellent model for multistage carcinogenesis. The development of carcinomas is assumed to be in part the result of genetic changes. Mutations of the tumor suppressor genes p53 en Rb are the most common genetic changes in human solid tumors. It has recently been shown that p53 transcription can also be inhibited by the MDM2 protein. Furthermore, p53 plays an important role in the cell cycle and new therapeutic approaches for p53 deficient tumors now seem to become feasible. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to determine the role of alterations of the tumor suppressor genes p53 and Rb as well as the expression of mdm2 in the carcinogenesis in the oral mucosa.",

All lesions were classified histologically according to the dysplasia grade in benign lesions, respectively the loss of differentiation in the pre malignant and malignant lesions. The number of mutation detected by PCR/SSCP was much smaller in comparison with the immunohistology. Rb was detected in all carcinomas by immunohistology, indicating a normal protein. This result was confirmed by our PCR/ SCCP-analysis, where no mutations were detected. Mdm2 expression was detected in 35 % of all cases. The expression of mdm2 was highest in undifferentiated SCC, indicating a further inactivation of p53 in these tumors. Our investigation shows that genetic alternation of p53 and mdm2 expression play an important role in oral carcinogenesis. Rb function appears to be normal.",

In such cases determining the precise location of MF is important since failure to do so may lead to haemorrhage and permanent neurologic damage. Radiography is the only available non-invasive method for diagnosis and treatment planning of major surgical procedures of the mandible. Panoramic radiographs are commonly used for screening, diagnosis and selecting the best possible surgical approach. The reliability of two panoramic x-ray machines (Philips Orthoralix SD ceph and Gendex Panelipes II) for determination of the location of the MF was studied using 100 dry mandibles. A significant correlation was found between the location of the MF in radiographs and the narrowest anterior posterior dimension of the ramus. An equation was developed that could predict the actual location of the MF from the radiographs (using a linear logistic regression). This finding will improve treatment planning in cases requiring orthognathic surgery. The Philips Orthoralix SD was found to be more reliable for this purpose than the Panelipse II.

Three types of RF are advocated: lag screws, position screws, and intraoral miniplates. Advantages of bone plates for RIF include: transoral placement, decreased risk of inferior alveolar nerve damage, and maintenance of condylar position. Yet little is known regarding the actual strength of the fixation provided by different configurations of bone plates. SSRO's were performed on 40 lamb hemimandibles which were divided into 5 groups of 8 each. These are: compression plate (CP) with 5 ram. advancement (AD) and 4 monocortical self-tapping screws; compression plate with no advancement (CP/NAD); non-compression plate with 5mm. advancement (NCP/AD); noncompression plate without advancement (NCP/NAD) ; and 2 plate (6 screw) NCP/AD. Screws were placed in the neutral position in the compression plates. The mandibles were then loaded under constant conditions in an Instron tensiometer. The load sustained to failure of the fixation was recorded and was as follows: CP/AD = 3.1 Kg,+2.2; CP/NAD = 9.4 Kg. _+ 4.9 ; NCP/AD = 6.7 Kg. _+ 1.9 ; NCP/NAD = 10.0 Kg. _+ 3.6; and 2 plate NCP/AD = 9.25 Kg. + 1.5. The non-compression group withstood a greater load than the compression plate groups for both advancement and non-advancement specimens. The initial cause of failure in the CP specimens appeared to be twisting of the screws in eccentric holes.",

Caudally, the retrodiscal pad appeared to be particularly rich in vessels and overhanging the fibrous disc in the upperjoint space. A 'hood' of synovial folds was regularly found to fill the craniocaudal aspects of the upper joint space. Villi could also be observed and were described.

Association between abdominal pain and hyperamylasemia strongly support the diagnosis of postoperative pancreatitis, which has a high rate of mortality if not treated.We have prospectively studied the serum amylase changes after oncological neck surgery in a serie of 20 patients suffering from epidermoid carcinoma of the oral cavity. We found a significant increase in the serum amylase level after this type of surgery, raising from a mean preoperative level of 132.07 U/I till 255.9 on the first postoperative day. (p < 0.1). Prior to surgery amylase serum levels were normal in all patients while 61.5% of the cases showed hyperamylasemia in the immediate postoperative period. Isoamylase assay showed a postoperative increase of the salivary fraction, raising from a preoperative mean value of 65.9 U/1 to 194.2 U/I in the postoperative period. We did not register any postoperative abdominal complications in this study.In conclusion, there is after oncological surgery a nonpathological increase in serum amylase level. In case of postoperative abdominal pain it is necessary to evaluate the S and P isoamylase in order to exclude a postoperative pancreatitis.",

A constant pulling force of 500 p was used along the long axes of the screws and the results of extrusion were compared for each screw type. In order to assess the dynamics of bone healing each sheep was marked with 'vital polychromes'. The sheep were sacrificed after 56 days. Undemineralized bone cuts of 10 respectively 50 microns thickness were made and fluorescent microscopic techniques were used to study the bony bed of the screws. Microradiographs were also available for assessment. Mini screws, PLLA screws and bioconvertible cortical bone screws showed an extrusion between 0.05 and 0.9 mm. In contrast to these results the 'bolt group' showed extrusion up to 5 mm. Microscopical evaluation of the bony bed showed more or less osteointegration in the group of mini screws and PLLA screws. In the group of bioconvertible bone screws perfect bone healing with revascularisation of the inserted material was observed.",

In the past, function was presumed to be improved after orthognathic surgery because of the increased amount of contact points of teeth in occlusion. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that masticatory function may not improve after orthognathic surgery in some patients. Many investigators believe that this is associated with histochemical alteration of the masticatory muscles.The primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether there is a relationship between change of mandibular ramus height and masseter muscle histochemistry.Materials and methods: Sixty-three rabbits were randomly divided into 5 groups.(1) Control group, 7 rabbits were sacrified after 4 weeks and 6 weeks respectively;(2) Decreasing ramus height group. 7 rabbits were sacrified after 4 weeks and 6 weeks;(3) Increasing ramus height I. 7 rabbits in which 3 mm bite-opening appliances were cemented on mandibular arches were sacrified after weeks and 6 weeks;(4)Increasing ramus height IX. 7 rabbits in which 5 mm bite-opening appliances were cemented on mandibular arches were killed after 4 weeks and 6 weeks;(5) Intermaxillary fixation(IMF) group. 7 rabbits were killed after 4 weeks.The right anterior masseter muscles were obtained forThe success of bone grafts depends on the osteo-inductive capacity (OC) of the bone material. This OC depends on the content of BMP, and on the rigidity of the binding of BMP to the bone and on the amount of inhibition of osteoinduction (IO). Two series of experiments have been carried out on rats: the first on the OC of bone of different parts of the skeleton and the second on the correlation of OC with bulk and surface of the graft.These studies have shown that the BMP quantity increases in the following order: parietal bone, rib, iliac crest, femur, mandible. The quantity of IO decreases in the same sequence and the 'lability' of BMP increases in the very same sequence. Parietal bone possesses a low OC because it contains little BMP and a lot of IO. Iliac crest and rib have a medium quantity of BMP and IO, but the BMP is very labile. Mandible and femur have the best osteo-inductive capacity.",

Inflammatory cell infiltration of articular surface was most severe in the Freeze-dried with Glycerol group and was least severe in the Deep-frozen with DMSO group. Viability of bone below the erosion zone showed few differences among four experimental groups. But the Glycerol groups were less viable than the DMSO groups. Degenerative change of condylar cartilage appeared after 1 week and disappeared after 6 weeks. The most intense change was in the Free-dried with Glycerol group. Maturing of condylar cartilage began at 2 weeks and there were no differences between Freeze-dried and Deep-frozen groups.

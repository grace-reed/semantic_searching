    "abstract": "Background: Coral reef ecosystems are renowned for their diversity and beauty. Their immense ecological success is due to a symbiotic association between cnidarian hosts and unicellular dinoflagellate algae, known as zooxanthellae. These algae are photosynthetic and the cnidarianzooxanthellae association is based on nutritional exchanges. Maintenance of such an intimate cellular partnership involves many crosstalks between the partners. To better characterize symbiotic relationships between a cnidarian host and its dinoflagellate symbionts, we conducted a large-scale EST study on a symbiotic sea anemone, Anemonia viridis, in which the two tissue layers (epiderm and gastroderm) can be easily separated. Results: A single cDNA library was constructed from symbiotic tissue of sea anemones A. viridis in various environmental conditions (both normal and stressed). We generated 39,939 high quality ESTs, which were assembled into 14,504 unique sequences (UniSeqs). Sequences were analysed and sorted according to their putative origin (animal, algal or bacterial). We identified many new repeated elements in the 3'UTR of most animal genes, suggesting that these elements potentially have a biological role, especially with respect to gene expression regulation. We identified genes of animal origin that have no homolog in the non-symbiotic starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis genome, but in other symbiotic cnidarians, and may therefore be involved in the symbiosis relationship in A. viridis. Comparison of protein domain occurrence in A. viridis with that in N. vectensis demonstrated an increase in abundance of some molecular functions, such as protein binding or antioxidant activity, suggesting that these functions are essential for the symbiotic state and may be specific adaptations. Conclusion: This large dataset of sequences provides a valuable resource for future studies on symbiotic interactions in Cnidaria. The comparison with the closest available genome, the sea anemone N. vectensis, as well as with EST datasets from other symbiotic cnidarians provided a set of candidate genes involved in symbiosis-related molecular crosstalks. Altogether, these results provide new molecular insights that could be used as a starting-point for further functional genomics studies.",

In most cases, such symbiont algae are dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium, commonly referred to as zooxanthellae. This association is a trophic endosymbiosis and is considered to be mutualistic because the zooxanthellae provide their cnidarian host with reduced organic carbon resulting from their photosynthetic activity [1] while the host provides the zooxanthellae with inorganic carbon [2] , inorganic nitrogen [3, 4] and inorganic phosphate [5] , as well as a refuge from herbivory. This simple mutual partnership has recently been revealed to be more complex, however, since the holobiont was found to be a dynamic assemblage of animal, zooxanthellae, endolithic algae and fungi, prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) and viruses [6, 7] . Endosymbioses are thus highly complex associations, implying intimate interactions between host and symbionts as well as constraints, such as hyperoxic conditions generated by symbiont photosynthesis, and transfer of inorganic carbon to the symbiont [8] .",

Coral reefs are, however, now also experiencing high levels of anthropogenically-induced stress (global climate change, pollution). Such environmental perturbations, in addition to pathogens, contribute to the breakdown of symbiosis known as \"coral bleaching\", and even mortality [15] . Bleaching results in whitening of cnidarian symbiotic tissues, due either to a direct loss of dinoflagellates and/or a decrease in photosynthetic pigment concentration [16] .

However, neither of these species is symbiotic. In addition, phylogenetic studies suggest that N. vectensis and A. viridis might belong to different suborders (Additional file 2), although both belong to the Hexacorallia Actiniaria [21] . Very few studies using high-throughput techniques have been published to date on symbiotic cnidarians. Most cDNA libraries have been constructed from non-symbiotic cells and only limited EST datasets were generated. Only three studies have been conducted on symbiotic anthozoans: Acropora millepora, a reef building coral (10, 247 ESTs; [19, 22] ); Aiptasia pulchella, a tropical Sea anemone (870 ESTs; [23] ); and a comparative study on two scleractinian corals, Montastrea faveolata (3, 854 ESTs) and Acropora palmata (14, 588 ESTs, [24] ). All have shown that cnidarians are more similar to vertebrates, in terms of gene repertoire, composition and intron/exon structure, than the well known ecdysozoan model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, where extensive gene loss has occurred [19, 22] . These EST datasets have been used to develop small-scale microarrays for gene expression analysis in several coral-algal symbioses: Acropora millepora, Acropora palmata and Montastrea faveolata [25] [26] [27] .",

A. viridis is the most abundant sea anemone of the Mediterranean coasts and hosts the temperate Symbiodinium sp. of Clade A, which has been suggested to be the dominant clade of zooxanthellae in the Mediterranean Sea [31] . We prepared a sin-gle cDNA library from whole specimens under several stress conditions, in order to maximize the presence of genes required for symbiosis. 39, 939 ESTs were generated and a total of 14,504 UniSeqs were identified, assigned a putative origin and annotated.

Ferritins are ubiquitously expressed proteins that have a central role in normal iron homoeostasis, as well as during oxidant stress, by reducing the participation of iron in free-radical-generating reactions [33] . Ferritin genes have also been identified as being highly expressed in Acropora EST datasets and one has been shown to be under positive selection [24] .

Over 1,500 repetitive sequences were identified, with 412 repeated more than 10 times in our UniSeqs dataset. A typical sequence would be around 200 bp length, harbouring 40-50 bp inverted terminal repeats at its extremities. These repeats often formed very long and stable hairpins, depending on their orientation ( Figure 2 ). They were found in 19.8% of UniSeqs and were overrepresented within contigs (62% of contigs contained at least one repeat). When open reading frame could be identified, these A. viridis repeated elements were always mapped in the 3'UTRs of the protein coding genes. Using a BlastN analysis, none of these sequences were found either in the genome of N. vectensis or in the large EST datasets of Hydra magnipapillata, and search in Repbase did not show any homologs. However, members of these A. viridis repeated elements could be found in the limited EST datasets available for the symbiotic coral Acropora millepora and the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Further structural and functional characterisations of these repeated elements are currently being made.",

The analysis pipeline used in this study is presented in Figure 1 . Sequences were compared with SwissProt (2008.03) and Uniprot KB (TrEMBL+Swissprot) (2008.03) databases using BlastX with a cutoff E-value of < 1.10 -10 to retrieve functional annotations. Of the assembled dataset, 6,238 UniSeqs had putative similarities while 8,266 had no sim- ilarity to any sequences in the chosen databases. Sequences were also compared with NCBI-indexed prokaryotic nucleic sequences (2007.08 release), using BlastN with a stringent E-value of < 1.10 -15 to assess the proportion of prokaryotic sequences. Finally, a specific search of the UniSeqs for virus proteins returned 7 hits. Relative contribution is shown in Figure 3 . First of all, a relatively high proportion of sequences (57%) remained that showed no significant similarities to previously described genes and were therefore considered as 'unknown'. This is somewhat comparable with results obtained from other cnidaria, Acropora palmata, Acropora millepora, Montastrea faveolata, and Nematostella vectensis [19, 24] . Most of the UniSeqs identified in Symbiodinium sp were also of unknown origin [28] . Metazoan hits were found for 32.3% of UniSeqs (75% of annotated sequences). Among these, most of the annotated UniSeqs (4,266 out of 4685) matched with Nematostella vectensis predicted proteins. However, we also identified sequences that were clearly from the host (first Blast hits of metazoan origin with cutoff E-value < 1.10 -50 ), but these had no significant similarity to predicted proteins of N. vectensis. Three of these (a glycoprotein, a ferroxidase and an amine-oxidase) were studied in more detail (Figure 4 ). PCR and sequencing were first performed on genomic DNA from both A. viridis epiderm and in vitro cultured Symbiodinium, which confirmed the animal origin of these sequences ( Figure 4A ). The first sequence studied is related to the ependymin glycoprotein family (more specifically to the Mammalian Ependymin-Related Proteins group or MERP1), which has been well described in vertebrates due to its involvement in the regeneration processes. Ependymins are secretory proteins that can bind calcium and that were found predominantly in the cerebrospinal fluid of teleost fish. A bound form has been described, associated with the extracellular matrix. Recent data demonstrated that these proteins are also present in non-vertebrate deuterostomes and protostomes [35] , and that positive selection may have shaped their evolution. Figure 4B illustrates an amino acid alignment of A. viridis MERP sequences to homologous proteins found in publicly available databases (Bayesian analysis of the MERP sequence confirmed the phylogenetic relationship, not shown). The presence of ependymin proteins in basal organisms clearly indicates for the first time that this protein family is far older than previously thought (first described as chordate-specific, then deuterostome-specific, and finally also found in protostomes).",

As this is never the case in other phyla (only one homologue was found in any other species), we could hypothesize that MERP are important for symbiosis in cnidarians. The second sequence is related to a copper-dependent ferroxidase family protein (hephaestin) involved in copper detoxification, which has been described both in eukaryotes (unicellular eukaryotes and vertebrates) and prokaryotes. Nevertheless, no significant similarity was found in D. melanogaster or in C. elegans genomes, nor in any available protostome database, suggesting that this has been lost during protostome evolution. The third sequence is related to a prokaryotic amine-oxidase (permease) family protein, which has also been identified in the genome of C. elegans and other Caenorhabditidae but not in any other animal sequence database. Such species-specific occurrence could be explained by the presence of a similar prokaryote in both nematoda and A. viridis associated flora (sequence contamination) or a parallel gene transfer event during their evolution. However, molecular phylogenetic analyses (neighbor joining, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood) showed that cnidarian and rhabditidae nematode sequences cluster to outside other prokaryote representative gene sequences (Additional file 5). The latter rather suggest that amine-oxidase genes were maintained in these taxa but lost in other metazoa.",

Such \"prokaryotic sequences\" could therefore be assigned to the sea anemone-associated flora. In addition, a small but significant number of A. viridis sequences, recognized as being of prokaryotic origin based on Blast analysis, had already been identified in the N. vectensis genome. Such genes are clearly similar in sequence to prokaryotic homologs, although they contain introns. In N. vectensis and A. millepora they were proposed as \"ancient genes\", conserved in cnidarians but lost in other animal genomes [19] . Although our results are in line with this interpretation, comparative genomic studies among cnidarians, such as A. viridis, could help to identify the most probable evolutionary scenario between maintenance of \"non-metazoan\" genes in cnidarians or lateral gene transfer events, followed by rapid intron acquisition.",

Figure 5 represents the distribution of GC content in the three major taxa (metazoans, unicellular eukaryotes and associated prokaryotic flora), as well as for sequences without BlastX hits (unknown). Two distinct distribution curves were observed, with the metazoan ESTs averaging 40% GC, while bacterial ESTs averaged 63%. Despite our small number of Symbiodinium sequences, their GC content (58%) agreed with that already published for dinoflagellates, which have a relatively high GC content compared with other eukaryotes: Triplett et al [36] calculated a GC content of 64% for Heterocapsa pygmaea and an EST analysis of Alexandrium tamarense estimated that coding region GC-content was 60.8%, whereas GC-content in the 3'-UTR was slightly less, at 57.6% [37] . GC-content analysis of our unknown sequences revealed that ESTs were clustered around two peaks corresponding to 35% and 58% GC content for the larger and smaller peaks respectively. These data strongly suggest that most of the unknown sequences are likely to be of animal origin. As the GC content of 3' UTRs is usually lower than that of 5' UTRs or CDSs, these results are also consistent with our hypothesis that these sequences are mainly 3' UTR (due to cloning strategy), which also explains their low level of annotation. On the other hand, the smaller peak (58% GC) could be attributed to dinoflagellate sequences, although no dinoflagellate genome is currently available to test this, and the most closely related available genomes are those of apicomplexans (Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii), which are also compact genomes of parasitic protozoans.",

To homogenize annotation level we only kept the root domain, using the hierarchical domain organization available from EBI. InterPro protein domains were identified in 40% of proteins.

Figure 7 represents the distribution of assigned gene ontology terms. Comparison of domain occurrence in A. viridis with that in N. vectensis demonstrated that our library is highly representative of the Actinaria transcriptome. We also identified increased abundance of a number of molecular functions in A. viridis compared with N. vectensis: translation regulator activity (0.46 vs 0.23%), oxidoreductase activity (6.86 vs 4.98%), antioxidant activity (0.07 vs 0.03%), and structural molecule activity (3.24 vs 1.28%). It is noteworthy that some of these molecular functions are involved in symbiotic interactions with zooxanthellae, such as protein binding [24] , nutrient transport and antioxidant activity [8] . For example, A. viridis counters the oxidative stress produced by the photosynthetic activity of its symbionts by using a great diversity of antioxidant defences [38] .

For example, we identified many novel repeated elements (RE) in 3'UTRs, suggesting an invasion of most animal sequences by some specific RE families. It will be interesting to further investigate their potential biological role, particularly on gene regulation. Phylogenetic origin and functional classification of the holobiont sequences allowed the identification of several symbiotic candidate genes. These data are now being used to develop a dedicated microarray that will provide a valuable resource for future studies on symbiotic interactions in A. viridis. Furthermore, these data also have shown the importance of Symbiodinium symbionts as well as the associated flora of the three major prokaryotic species. Some sequences will be further analysed from the new perspective of gene transfer between host and symbiont. The relatively low abundance of sequences from Symbiodinium was attributed to experimental bias; a new ongoing sequencing project should fill this gap. Finally, these data from a temperate zone cnidarian provide novel molecular insights that will complement those obtained from tropical anthozoans. This dataset is valuable resource that will be of great help for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies.",

The chromatogram files were exported to PHRED for base calling [40, 41] . Cloned insert detection was made according to different detected features (vector, adaptator, poly(A) or poly(T) tails and repeat) and their respectively positions, using third party programs (Crossmatch and RepeatMasker). Only inserts with more than 100 bp, with a Phred score >20, and not belonging to a low complexity area were exported into a fasta format with its corresponding quality file. Additional extremity trimming was made using the \"trimseq\" command (EMBOSS package). Low complexity regions and repeats were masked using the RepeatMasker program [42] . For this purpose, two different libraries were used: the RepeatMaskerLib (RepBase Update of 2007.09.24, [43] ) and a custom library of A. viridis. This custom library was made both by using CENSOR [44] to retrieve publicly available repeats, and by running a BlastN of all ESTs against themselves to identify the most abundant repeat regions.",

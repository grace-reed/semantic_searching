Statistical optimization of production media was carried by establishing an 11 variables 17 run experiment through PB model which evinced starch, calcium carbonate, pH and inoculum concentration that highly influenced bioactive compound production.

Often, shallow and deep-water sediments are proven source for antimicrobial and antitumor compounds-producing microorganisms (Zheng et al. 2000; Gu et al. 2004; Kwon et al. 2006) . Generally, Actinobacteria accounts for more than 7000 bioactive compounds as reported in the Dictionary of Natural Products. Among them, Streptomyces genus alone contribute for more than 80% of the actinobacterial compounds (Jensen et al. 2005; Bull and Stach 2007) . Dalisay et al. (2013) found that 25% of Streptomyces isolated from marine environment showed antimicrobial activity, which increased when tested with seawater. On the other hand, multiple drug-resistant bacteria and other clinical pathogens are evolving as big threat to human community leading to high morbidity and mortality especially in developing countries (Campfield et al. 2014) . Hence, the present investigation was focused on discovery of novel bioactive compounds for the treatment of such burgeoning diseases.",

All the collected samples were dried in hot air oven at 55 \u00b0C for 30 min, serially diluted, and plated on starch casein agar and Actinomycete isolation agar (Himedia). The plates were incubated for 7-10 days under room temperature, and the matured colonies were sub-cultured on YEME agar.

To analyze the antagonistic ability of the isolates, each strain was inoculated into starch casein broth and incubated in rotary shaker at 28 \u00b0C for 7 days.

The variables such as starch, casein, sodium chloride, temperature, pH, and inoculum concentrations expressed antimicrobial compound in all ranges served with difference in production volume. Based on the results of One variable-at-a-time strategy Plackett-Burman experimental model (Table 3) was attempted, where the eighth run produced maximum amount of antimicrobial compound followed by eleventh run. ANOVA test revealed F value of 21.39 and a low probability value of 0.0047, thereby implying that the model is significant (Tables 4, 5) . The p values of A, G, K, and L were significant as they are less than 0.05, whereas other values were greater and not significant (Li et al. 2008) . The predicted R 2 value 0.9832 variability in response, is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted R 2 value 0.9408. The lack of fit value 0.4545 for the design is insignificant, suggested that the obtained data were good in fit. The Pareto chart indicates that the pH (K), calcium carbonate (G), starch (A), and inoculum concentration (L) were highly influencing the antimicrobial compound production (Fig. 4) . Particularly, calcium carbonate and pH were influencing the production positively, whereas starch and inoculum concentration were influencing negatively. The antimicrobial compound production could be predicted with the regression equations derived through Plackett-Burman model as follows:",

Even, a regression model having an R 2 value higher than 0.90 was considered as a high correlation factor (Chen et al. 2009) . The standard error counter plot was very circular and flat, indicating that the design is very significant. Conclusively, PB design identified the (Murugesan et al. 2013) significant factors that influence antimicrobial compound production. The obtained variables through central composite design may be utilized to identify the precise medium for enhanced production of antimicrobial compounds. Ethyl acetate was concluded as best solvent for extraction of antimicrobial compounds (SM 2) (Parthasarathi et al. 2012; Vijayakumar et al. 2012) . Nithyanand et al.

Saligenin is used as multipurpose drug that can act as analgesic and antipyretic agents. Earlier, the antimicrobial activity of salicyl alcohol against 20 bacterial strains were studied by Harun et al. (2005) . Results showed promising antagonistic effects against Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp, and S. aureus, which are in highly accordance with current investigation. Ghasemzadeh et al. (2012) and Vejselova and Kutlu (2015) reported the anticancer potential of salicylic acid against MCF7 cell line and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma, respectively. Another study carried by El-Shemy et al. (2007) suggested that salicyl alcohol, contains antitumor activity, which can eliminate immature white blood cells through apoptosis associated DNA damage. Moreover, salicyl alcohol can induce resistance to multiple antibiotics in bacteria, notably the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents (Cohen et al. 1993) .",

The strain BDK01 was phylogenetically closer to identified as S. chumphonensis KK1-2 T , a novel species recently reported by Phongsopitanum et al. 2014and yet to be studied for any bioprospecting potential. Hence, to our knowledge, the present study serve as a first report for antimicrobial activity in this species. The isolate S. chumphonensis strain BDK01 exhibited significant antagonistic activity against test bacterial and fungal strains. Moreover, the crude compound displayed remarkable IC 50 value of 9.5 \u00b5g/ml against MCF-7 (Breast Cancer) cell line, which demonstrate its activity to combat cancer cell proliferation. Optimization of production media was done statistically towards the maximization of antimicrobial compound production. Metabolic profiling of the active compounds was reported through spectral studies. Further exploration of S. chumphonensis strain BDK01 will throw light on its pharmacological potential which could benefit drug industries.",

    "abstract": "Extreme events associated with global warming, such as ocean heat waves, can have contrasting fitness consequences for different species, thereby modifying the structure and composition of marine communities. Here, we examined the effects of a laboratory simulated heat wave on the physiology and performance of two Indo-Pacific crustacean species: the shrimp Rhynchocinetes durbanensis and the hermit crab Calcinus laevimanus. We exposed the crustaceans to a control temperature or to a +5\u00b0C temperature (25\u00b0C vs 30\u00b0C) for two consecutive weeks, and weekly analyzed protective proteins, antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxides in muscle and visceral mass. Fulton's K, total protein, %C, and C:N molar ratio of muscle tissue were also analyzed at the end of the experiment. Results showed that 1) the most responsive tissues were the muscle in the shrimp species and the visceral mass in the hermit crab species; 2) biomarker responses in both species occurred mostly after 7 days of exposure; 3) temperature stress led to an increase in biomarker levels; 4) highest biomarker fold-changes were detected in protective chaperones and antioxidants superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase; 4) integrated biomarker indices suggested poorer health status in individuals subjected to the heat wave; 5) performance changes at the organism level were only detected in R. durbanensis; and 6) mortality rates of both species remained unchanged with the heat wave. Finally, we concluded that these species are capable of physiological adjustments in response to rapid environmental changes, which ultimately confers them with enough thermal tolerance to withstand this simulated heat wave without major consequences for fitness.",

                "text": "A body of evidence is building up concerning global increases in extreme weather and climatic events (EWCEs), including the occurrence of heat waves. Global future projections show that warmer and more frequent days above 35\u00b0C (maximum air temperature), as well as increased frequency of heat waves, have a 90%-99% probability to occur (IPCC, 2014) . Maximum daily temperatures have risen 2.3\u00b0C worldwide between 1981 and 2000, and projections estimate an additional 3.5\u00b0C for 2081-2100 (Kharin et al., 2007) . The intensity and duration of these extreme events are also expected to increase as global warming continues (Goodess, 2012) . Because EWCE events are key drivers of marine biodiversity patterns (Wernberg et al., 2016) , addressing how such episodic events affect species performance is critical to further develop predictive models of species distribution and go beyond their current basis on gradual warming trends (Ummenhofer and Meehl, 2017) .",

                "text": "The Indo-Pacific region has been ground of some record-breaking heat waves in a very recent past (2013) (2014) (2015) . For instance, SST (sea surface temperature) data showed anomalies exceeding three standard deviations in consecutive years in the north Pacific (Di Lorenzo and Mantua, 2016) . In 2015-2016, the Indian and Pacific oceans experienced extremely high tropical SSTs associated to an El Ni\u00f1o event, which resulted in the third massive coral bleaching event recorded in history, spanning from Australia to Southeast Asia (NOAA, 2015) . In the Western Indian ocean, mainly along the African coastal line, the magnitude of heat waves has also increased since 1996 in temperature, days, and extension area (Ceccherini et al., 2017) . Finally, warm pools in the Indian and Pacific oceans are also expanding, with areas between 29\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C showing the largest increase rates at interdecadal timescales (Lin et al., 2011 (Lin et al., , 2013 . Marine organisms exposed to extreme or unusual environmental https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.08.015 Received 18 April 2018; Received in revised form 22 August 2018; Accepted 25 August 2018 changes can have different responses, resulting in varying outcomes for their populations. If environmental changes are physiologically tolerable (i.e. animals have the ability to adjust their physiology to maintain homeostasis), individual acclimation and/or adaptation over generations can occur. If environmental changes are physiologically intolerable, migration or death might follow (Gonz\u00e1lez-Orteg\u00f3n et al., 2013) , with consequent re-distribution of species. Ectothermic animals are especially vulnerable to extreme temperatures and may therefore experience severe performance decrements during a heat wave event. Nevertheless, even ectotherms are able to modulate metabolic mechanisms and behavior to some extent to maintain physiological functions, cell survival, and avoid organ failure (Feder and Hofmann, 1999; Logan and Somero, 2011; Madeira et al., 2016) . One of the main effects of increased temperature at a cellular level is membrane leakiness, which results in higher ATP demand and exacerbates the use and need for ATP under heat stress. Ultimately, this leads to a mismatch between the oxygen demand and supply system (P\u00f6rtner and Knust, 2007) , which decreases the efficiency of aerobic metabolism. The higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in such conditions exacerbates cellular oxidative stress, leading to macromolecular damage, e.g. to protein structure (Hofmann and Somero, 1995; Kregel, 2002) , and DNA (K\u00fcltz, 2004) . When the damage extension rises above a certain threshold, cell apoptosis and tissue necrosis can occur (Mukherjee, 2008; Madeira et al., 2014b) . As a consequence, organisms may down-regulate their aerobic energy metabolism whereas other metabolic pathways are activated to respond to increased oxidative stress, or organisms may switch metabolic energy fuels (Tomanek, 2014) . Specifically, cytoprotective pathways include: 1) management of damaged/denatured molecules, through increased production of heat shock proteins and proteolysis via the ubiquitinproteasome pathway (Hofmann and Somero, 1995; Halpin et al., 2002; Tomanek and Somero, 2002; Hofmann, 2005; Madeira et al., 2012) , 2) regulation of oxidative stress and detoxification of toxic byproducts by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity (with ROS scavenging function) (Lushchak, 2011; Madeira et al., 2013 Madeira et al., , 2014a Vinagre et al., 2014) , 3) shifting from pro-oxidant NADH producing and oxidizing pathways to antioxidant NADPH producing and consuming pathways (Wegener, 1988; Alberts et al., 2002; Tomanek, 2014) .",

If heat waves affect these organisms' health, growth, or survival, there may be unforeseen functional consequences for coastal populations and communities. In particular, we aimed to: 1) compare these species' thermal stress responses at two ecologically relevant experimental temperatures (control and heat wave simulation), using a set of selected thermal, oxidative, neurotoxicity, and energy metabolism biomarkers; 2) perform a comprehensive and comparative animal health assessment between control and heat wave conditions, based on integrated biomarker indices to understand the role of thermal induced stress in physiological or health impairments; and 3) analyze each species performance at control and extreme temperature by measuring body condition and mortality.",

                "text": "Two circumtropical crustacean species commonly found in the Indo-Pacific region were used in this study: the camel shrimp Rhynchocinetes durbanensis (Gordon, 1936) , and the orange and black hermit crab Calcinus laevimanus (Randall, 1840). Both species inhabit reef areas, either in biogenic (coral) reefs or rocky platforms. R. durbanensis is a subtidal species, living at depths from 2 to 40 m (Weinberg, 2005) , whereas C. laevimanus is both intertidal and subtidal, and can be found at any depth from 0 to 95 m (Markham, 2003) . Adult specimens (n = 30 individuals for each species; 17 males and 13 females of R. durbanensis, whereas for Calcinus laevimanus gender determination was not possible) were obtained from Op\u00e9rculo, Lda \u00ae ornamental aquaculture company (Guincho, Portugal). The use of captive-bred animals is justified based on the necessity of having knowledge and control on the animals' thermal histories, thereby eliminating carry over effects that may occur when early larvae or juvenile stages are exposed to varying thermal conditions. Upon arrival at the laboratory, animals were placed in one indoor re-circulating water system (total volume of 2000 L), comprised of four 70 L polyvinyl tanks supplied with aerated sea water, one sump, an external skimmer, and an UV filter. Crustaceans were haphazardly distributed across tanks (n = 7-8 individuals of each species per tank) and allowed to acclimate at 25.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C for 2 weeks. All experimental procedures were approved by Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Geral de Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e Veterin\u00e1ria (DGAV) following ethical guidelines in national and international legislation. Study design followed ARRIVE guidelines and recommendations by the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (see Festing and Altman, 2002; Hau and Schapiro, 2010) . Common-garden experiments are the goldstandard design to separate environmental/laboratory controlled effects from possible differentiation among populations and animals of a single species (Gait\u00e1n-Espitia et al., 2017) . Therefore, the experiments consisted of two temperature treatments using common garden conditions: 25.0\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C (controltemperature at which the animals were reared, corresponding to mean temperatures in the Indo-Pacific region outside warm-pool areas, as shown by satellite data in www. seatemperature.org) and 30.0\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C (simulating a +5.0\u00b0C heat wave event), with the duration of two weeks and samplings at 0, 7, and 14 days. The duration of the experiment was based on the following rationale: present duration of heat waves in the Indo-Pacific is on average 5-7 days, but time-series trends show an increase in heat wave duration of about 1.3 days.decade \u22121 from 1961 to 2013, and if this trend is to be continued, future heat waves by the end of this century are expected to last for up to two weeks (Zinke et al., 2015; Rohini et al., 2016; Ceccherini et al., 2017) . To simulate the heat wave, we used a stepwise method to increase temperature in the treatment group. At day zero, temperature was increased from 25.0\u00b0C to 27.0\u00b0C. After 24 h at 27.0\u00b0C, temperature was increased further up to 30.0\u00b0C and then kept for two consecutive weeks. Then, on the last day, temperatures were lowered again to 25.0\u00b0C. Animals in the control treatment were kept at 25.0\u00b0C throughout the 14-day period. This procedure follows Collier and Waycott (2014) and Arambourou and Stoks (2015) for heat wave simulation experiments. Each treatment had 2 replicate tanks (35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 55 cm each), with 7-8 individuals of each species per tank. All tanks were provided with a thermostat heater (ELITE 200W). To keep environmental parameters constant throughout the experiment, a monitoring scheme was employed. Each tank was provided with a Petco thermometer with suction cup to continuously monitor temperature. Other parameters, such as salinity (kept at 35), pH (kept at 8 \u00b1 0.01), ammonia (kept below 0.25 mg L \u22121 ), and nitrites (kept under 0.3 mg L \u22121 ), were monitored twice a week using a hand-held refractometer (Atago, Japan), a digital pH probe (model HI9025, Hanna Instruments, USA), and Tetra Test Kits (Tetra Ammonia Test Kit and Tetra Nitrites Test Kit, USA), respectively. Animals were fed twice a day with fresh food (mixture of shrimp and mussels in proportion 1:1) and dry food (Tropical Super Spirulina Forte Mini Granulat), except in sampling days as animals were not fed in the prior 24 h. Environmental enrichment consisted of adding sand, live rocks, and seaweed Caulerpa taxifolia to the tanks. Mortality was recorded every day in each tank. At each sampling day, 5 animals of each species from each treatment were chosen randomly (n = 5 individuals \u00d7 3 timepoints \u00d7 2 temperatures = 30), sacrificed by longitudinal transection, and then measured and weighed. Internal organs (muscle and visceral mass) were extracted and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further analyses.",

In this study, we showed for both crustacean species that temperature effects were mainly detected in the amount of protective proteins and enzyme activity levels. Performance consequences were only observed in R. durbanensis, particularly in condition and energy reserves. The general pattern of biomarker variation here analyzed showed that: 1) different species and different tissues display different thermal sensitivities, 2) biomarker changes occurred at similar timings for both species, and 3) biomarkers with significant log 2 fold-changes showed mild to moderate (Hsp70, CAT, GST) or severe stress (Ub and LPO) in cells (cell stress degree as in Logan and Somero, 2011) . All these observations suggest that an increase of +5\u00b0C during two consecutive weeks had a significant quantifiable impact in these species' physiology. Heat waves are generally associated to an increase in animals' metabolic activity (Arambourou and Stoks, 2015) , which is mostly associated with increased respiration rates as a consequence of extra maintenance, repair, and protein production (Feder and Hofmann, 1999; Tomanek, 2010) . This ultimately suggests that organisms need to adjust their metabolic rates during heat stress in order to balance tissue oxygenation and energy production/expenditure (McElroy et al., 2012) . The high magnitude of fold-changes detected in Hsp70 in the muscle and SOD in visceral mass for R. durbanensis after 7 days suggests that increased temperature caused protein unfolding and cytotoxic aggregations (Yamashita et al., 2010; Madeira et al., 2015a) in muscle cells, and a higher flux of superoxide radical arising from oxidative stress (Rosa et al., 2014) in visceral mass. C. laevimanus showed highest order of magnitude changes in GST (at 14 days) in the visceral mass, suggesting enzyme activity to detoxify toxic lipid peroxides that arose (at 7 days) from oxidative damage to cell membranes (Madeira et al., 2013; Vinagre et al., 2014) . Such responses to a thermal challenge have also been documented in many other crustacean species (e.g. caridean shrimps: Palaemon spp. Allan et al., 2006; Gonz\u00e1lez-Orteg\u00f3n et al., 2013; Madeira et al., 2015b; Magozzi and Calosi, 2015, and Crangon crangon Reiser et al., 2014; white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2010; lobster Homarus americanus Chang, 2005 ; and grapsidae crab Cyclograpsus cinereus Lardies et al., 2011) . Mean IBR values were always higher at 30\u00b0C when compared to 25\u00b0C (except for muscle in C. laevimanus), indicating that animals exposed to the heat wave were in poorer health status (i.e., stressed) when compared to control conditions.",

Neither species showed changes in mortality levels, suggesting that the 5\u00b0C temperature increase over two consecutive weeks was not an extremely stressful one. However, the imposed temperature did show a significant influence in performance parameters of R. durbanensis. Although Fulton's K increased during the heat wave, %C levels decreased, indicating a process of depletion of lipid reserves. Other studies have also shown that thermal stress (either warm or cold) can cause lowered energy stores (Klepsatel et al., 2016; Wen et al., 2017) , even if growth increases (Arambourou and Stoks, 2015) . Another aspect of the results was the significant correlation obtained between %C and LPO levelsthe amount of stored lipids seems to be a key aspect in the extension of lipid peroxidation experienced by the animals under heat stress. However, opposite correlations were observed for each species (positive for R. durbanensis and negative for C. laevimanus), which makes it difficult to hypothesize which pathways are at work. We suggest two possibilities: 1) a positive correlation suggests that lipid rich tissues suffer proportionally from lipid oxidation leading to increased accumulation of LPOs, whereas 2) a negative correlation suggests that lipid rich tissues have more energy available to direct towards cytoprotective pathways, therefore avoiding cellular damage and leading to low levels of LPOs. However, this is an issue that requires further research before any conclusions can be drawn.",

For instance, the shrimp R. durbanensis is a strictly subtidal animal, while the hermit crab C. laevimanus inhabits both intertidal and subtidal areas, which means that hermit crabs are more versatile and are commonly used to explore steep thermal gradients (Helmuth and Hofmann, 2001; Somero, 2002; Madeira et al., 2015b) . This is a very significant feature in intertidal reefs where there are topographically complex microhabitats including rock pools, crevices, boulders, and emergent platforms (Lathlean et al., 2017) . Consequently, hermit crabs' responses may be more plastic, mediated by internal changes that can include, but are not limited to, higher basal biomarker levels and inducible responses (Madeira et al., 2014a (Madeira et al., , 2017b , sooner activation of energy saving cellular pathways (e.g. metabolic depression) (Madeira et al., 2015b) , and changes in mitochondrial densities and in the oxygen supply system (e.g. hemolymph hematocrit) (Abele et al., 2002; Verberk et al., 2016) . All of these possible responses allow hermit crabs to optimize metabolism in varying thermal windows. Therefore, higher acclimation to temperature variation could be expected for C. laevimanus when compared to R. durbanensis.",

                "text": "The absence of mortality for both species during the heat wave here simulated can be associated with several reasons. It is possible that the thermal challenge was not intense or prolonged enough to cause mortality, even though this was the first time that these animals were exposed to 30\u00b0C (both crustaceans were bred, reared, and maintained at 25\u00b0C). Previous studies have shown that animals have the ability to withstand temporal spikes in temperature (Arambourou and Stoks, 2015) until a certain physiological threshold is achieved, above which growth is severely affected and mortality levels can rise up to 100% of the population. Additionally 1) the previous generations may have originated from strains resistant to temperature variation, depending on the original broodstock thermal history; 2) high acclimation to captivity conditions may limit stress response patterns (Madeira et al., 2017a ) (as domestication affects thermal physiology and the more generations have been kept in captivity, the stronger this effect may be due to inbreeding and lower genetic diversity); 3) both species are native to reef environments that naturally experience dynamic temperature variations over short periods, even at subtidal depths (Leichter et al., 2006) . For instance, it is known that sub-surface temperatures can vary as a result of diurnal warming in shallow waters up to 10 m depth (Brown, 1997; Craig et al., 2001) , and due to tidal forcing and internal waves at greater depths (20-30 m) (Lee et al., 1999) . As the high specific heat and thermal conductivity of water ensure that marine ectotherms will have body temperatures equivalent to that of their surroundings (Feder and Hofmann, 1999) , then inhabitants of these environments are likely adapted to the kind of thermal challenge tested here.",

This seems to be the case for the species here studied as their natural distributions are broad -from eastern Africa, to India, Southeast Asia and Western Pacific islands (R. durbanensis, Grave, 2010; C. laevimanus, Lemaitre and McLaughlin, 2017) . Also, SST variability exhibited along the coast lines of the Indo-Pacific region where these species inhabit ranges from about 22\u00b0C to 31\u00b0C. Interestingly, the capacity to acclimate to altered conditions in such cases is likely to be similar among most of the natural populations of those species along latitudinal gradients, if there are no restrictions to gene flow, as was observed for the crab Petrolisthes violaceus along the Pacific coast of Chile (Gait\u00e1n-Espitia et al., 2017) . This means that even tank-raised species may share this capacity with their wild counterparts, inherited from the original broodstocks. Fig. 3 .

The chosen approach highlights the mechanistic background for thermal stress and/or acclimation responses of the species tested while yielding reliable results for thermal stress monitoring purposes. The calculated indices have shown to be intuitive, easy to understand and to communicate results. It is expected that they can be used to identify vulnerable species and populations, and categorize their susceptibility to extreme thermal events when combined with whole body performance measures. On the other hand, their integrative nature can lead to loosing details between the different processes and components of responses at variable levels of biological complexity (i.e., macromolecular damage, ROS scavenging, accumulation of energy reserves and whole-body performance) during the analysis. By further optimizing such tools and methodologies, we can then implement them in field studies with natural populations and fill the knowledge gap on tropical thermal stress biology by placing physiological information in a larger ecological context. This provides a first step on improving ecological risk assessment of vulnerable populations and it will allow the implementation of better conservation measures in already fragile tropical communities.",

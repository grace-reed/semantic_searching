While immediate early genes are primed for rapid induction, the specific impediments to their expression under basal conditions, and the mechanisms that relieve these constraints are still poorly understood. Recently, we reported that activity-dependent stimulation of cultured primary neurons triggers the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in the promoters of a subset of immediate early genes, including Fos, Npas4, and Egr1. These activity-induced DSBs are generated by the type II topoisomerase, topoisomerase II\u03b2 (Top2B), and we showed surprisingly that Top2B-mediated DSBs facilitate the rapid induction of these aforementioned IEGs. Together, these results raise intriguing questions about the mechanisms that regulate the formation of stimulus-induced DSBs at specific genomic loci and whether the formation of these DSBs has a role in neuronal functions, including in the development of adaptive behaviors.",

We have obtained a mouse model (Top2bf/f mice) in which the expression of Cre recombinase allows for the conditional deletion of endogenous Top2b. To understand whether DSBs formed in vivo are also a result of Top2B activity, conditional Top2bf/f mice were crossed with CaMKII\u03b1-Cre mice, which causes for the deletion of Top2b from excitatory forebrain neurons in adult mice. The resultant Top2bCKO mice were subject to CFC at 8 weeks of age, following which hippocampal lysates were prepared and \u03b3H2AX levels were assessed by western blotting. To understand whether the formation of activity-induced DSBs affects learning behaviors, two month-old male Top2bCKO mice (12 animal per group) were subjected to various behavioral paradigms, including open-field and light-dark tests, object recognition and object location tasks, and contextual and cued fear conditioning tests. Finally, molecular mechanisms that regulate the formation of Top2B-mediated DSBs were investigated through a combination of targeted mass spectrometry, mutagenesis of Top2B, and imaging-based assays to detect the formation of stimulus-induced DSBs in cultured primary neurons.",

Gene ontology analysis revealed a significant enrichment of biological processes related to synaptic transmission and synaptic function within loci that incur DSBs in the hippocampus following CFC.

There is growing evidence that brain development beginning in utero has implications for brain aging, potentially through the disruption of stress-immune pathways, known as prenatal stress models of brain aging. The default mode network (DMN) in the brain, which primarily includes medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), lateral parietal cortex (LP), and hippocampus (HIPP), some areas which are shared with stress circuitry regions, has been found to be important for cognitive aging and vulnerable to early Alzheimer's disease pathology. In aging, intrinsic functional connectivity within the DMN breaks down, with decreased connectivity between anterior and posterior regions as well as within posterior regions of the network. In addition to chronological aging, women undergo reproductive aging, during which they experience a depletion of sex steroid hormones such as estradiol, which we previously demonstrated is directly related to decreased memory performance and reorganization of functional memory circuitries. Here, we aim to integrate previous work on brain aging through a combined investigation of prenatal stress exposures, reproductive aging in women, and the DMN. We tested the impact of preeclampsia (PE) or fetal growth restriction (FGR) on sex differences in the intrinsic functional connectivity of the DMN in early midlife as women transition through menopause.",

Taken together, Background: The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is the rodent homologue of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and is critical for mediating executive functions such as working memory and cognitive flexibility. These executive functions are important for supporting cost-benefit decision making such as whether to choose an option that yields a small reward delivered immediately versus an option that yields a larger reward delivered at some point in the future (intertemporal choice). Previous work in both rats and humans indicates that older subjects exhibit greater preference than young for large, delayed over small, immediate rewards. These preferences correlate with age-associated impairments on a PFC-dependent task of cognitive flexibility, suggesting PFC dysfunction in aging contributes to altered intertemporal decision making. The current study used an optogenetic approach to more precisely define the temporally-specific contributions of mPFC neural activity to intertemporal decision-making, and to determine if the engagement of PFC in decision making changes in aging.",

Rats were subsequently trained on an adjustingdelay intertemporal choice task in which preference for small vs. large rewards was evaluated in the presence of ascending delays to large rewards. Upon reaching stable performance, a withinsubjects design was used to inactivate mPFC during discrete phases of each choice trial Results: In young rats, inactivation of the mPFC prior to choices increased young rats' preference for the large, delayed reward (produced less impulsive behavior). In contrast, mPFC inactivation prior to the choice had no effect in aged rats.

Background: Postmenopausal women have the highest rate of obesity of any sex-and age-group, and those with obesity are at an increased risk of developing dementia, even after controlling for age, education, and mid-to-late life cardiometabolic comorbidity. Insulin resistance plays a key role in hippocampal-mediated memory functioning, with prior studies reporting inverse relationships between the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), memory performance, and hippocampal volume in women at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Additional data support the role of HOMA-IR in mediating the relationship between BMI and brain activation during standard working memory tasks. However, these paradigms have limited sensitivity to detect early phases memory decline. Associative memory tasks, such as the face-name pair encoding paradigm, on the other hand, elicit robust activation of memory networks which is highly sensitive to mild memory impairment. Previous reports indicate that cognitively intact older adults with poor task-related memory performance exhibit dysfunction in the normative reciprocal relationships between activation in medial temporal lobe structures [hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) , inferior frontal gyrus (IFG); increased activity] and default mode structures [precuneus, superior parietal lobule (SPL); deactivation] during successful associative encoding. To date, there is a paucity of data focused on relationships between BMI status, insulin resistance, and brain activation in response to associative encoding paradigms. The goal of this preliminary study was to examine differences between obese and healthy-weight postmenopausal women in memory network activation during associative encoding, and relationships with insulin resistance. Methods: Postmenopausal, non-diabetic women with no history of hormone replacement therapy [10 women with obesity (OB group), 54.1 \u00b1 3.0 years; 33.7 \u00b1 4.0 BMI; 12 age-matched healthy-weight women (HW group), 55.6 \u00b1 2.7 years; 22.4 \u00b1 2.1 BMI] completed a visit including a fasting blood draw and an fMRI scanning session involving an associative memory paradigm, during which they viewed novel and repeated pairings of faces and names while undergoing fMRI scanning on a 3T Siemens Skyra MR scanner, followed by a retention test outside the scanner and a neuropsychological battery (verbal fluency, verbal IQ, working memory). Glucose and insulin were analyzed in duplicate using commercial immunoassay kits. Data analysis: fMRI data were analyzed using SPM12 to examine between-group (HW vs. OB) contrasts: Novel > Repeated; Fixation > Novel + Repeated (to assess deactivation during encoding). Regions of interest (ROIs) were based on prior reports using this paradigm; for Novel > Repeated: hippocampus, PHG, IFG; for Fixation > Novel + Repeated: precuneus, SPL. Given small sample sizes in each group, clusters meeting a threshold of k > 10 and p(uncorrected) <0.005 are reported. Individual subject beta estimates were extracted from selected ROIs using REX. Relationships between beta estimates and HOMA-IR were examined using general linear models in SPSSv19.",

Chronic inflammation appears to induce marginal learning deficits and impair cognitive flexibility in males while females require the combination of chronic inflammation and stress before deficits are evident. Chronic repeated stress induces long-lasting anxiety-like behavior which is attenuated by chronic inflammation in both male and female mice with a history of stress. These data indicate a unique interaction between sex, stress, and chronic inflammation on behaviorspecifically, while stress and inflammation can both cause detrimental effects to behavior, the extent of these changes and their direction are modified by sex. The changes in synaptosomal respiration suggest that sex, stress history, and inflammation again interact to create a unique, individualized metabolic profile. Changes in synaptic metabolism can undermine synaptic function leading to deficits in behavior. Collectively, these data highlight how sex, stress history, and inflammation can interact to shape individualized patterns of behavior possibly driven by altered synaptic metabolism. Alterations in synaptic metabolism may have implications for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.",

Exposure-based therapy is among the best supported interventions for PTSD, yet remission rates are typically only 50-60%.

The role of dopaminergic signaling during the post-fear extinction consolidation window has not been investigated in PTSD, despite a growing body of data implicating dopamine as a critical mechanism underlying fear extinction learning, consolidation, and subsequent recall.",

With respect to potential acute mechanisms by which L-DOPA boosts consolidation of extinction learning, the data demonstrated increased neural reactivation of amygdala patterns engaged in response to stimulus offsets (i.e., prediction error teaching signals) during extinction in both drug groups. The specificity of reactivations to the extinction, rather than acquisition, offset patterns is important, as it rules out an alternative explanation of these data: that L-DOPA impairs consolidation of acquisition memories rather than boosting consolidation of extinction memories. We also observed corroborating functional relationships with degree of amygdala extinction reactivation patterns, such that greater reactivations were associated with less AI / IFG network overall activation and less AI responding specifically to the CS + in the acquisition context (i.e., decreased context renewal).",

Although fMRI studies have identified regions underlying anger experience and expression, how these circuits interact with trauma remains unclear.

Methods: Resting-state fMRI was recorded from 162 traumaexposed veterans (age 32.9 + /-7.7, 143 male), including 97 without mental illness and 65 with PTSD. The trait anger measure STAXI-2 was used to classify participants into high ( > 75th percentile, population norm) or low (<25th percentile) anger groups. Global functional connectivity values were calculated for 133 cortical and subcortical regions and entered into a generalized linear model comparing healthy controls, high-anger PTSD patients, and low-anger PTSD patients, while controlling for age, gender, education, IQ, PTSD severity, depression severity, and site of fMRI acquisition. Regions with significant global connectivity differences after FDR correction were subsequently analyzed for group differences in pairwise functional connectivity.

The success of exposure-based psychotherapies for these disorders relies on no longer avoiding anxiety-provoking situations. While initial fear acquisition and avoidance generalizes easily across contexts, subsequently learning to not avoid is context-bound and may not readily generalize. The influence of context on learning is mediated by hippocampal-prefrontal connections and represents a novel target for future treatment development. To this end, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the prefrontal cortex may disrupt contextual encoding to subsequently facilitate generalization of avoidancebased associative learning to novel contexts. However, prefrontal inhibition due to tDCS should also impair avoidance-based associative learning. Here we tested whether cathodal tDCS applied during a contextually-bound reversal learning task 1) acutely impaired avoidance-based associative learning, and 2) facilitated generalization of avoidance-based associative learning to a novel context indicative of reduced contextual encoding.",

In mice, the output region of the ventral hippocampus, the ventral CA1 (vCA1), has direct connections to both fear and reward circuits and mediates expression of innate and learned fear as well as reward-seeking behavior. Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons help regulate outputs from the vCA1, and altered functioning of this cell population has been implicated in stress models and psychiatric disease states. In these studies, we determine the behavioral and local network activity effects of PV cell inhibition using optogenetics and immediate early gene quantification. We also examine in vivo PV cell activity during anxiety-like and reward-seeking behaviors using calcium imaging with miniature microscopes. Methods: Male and female PV-Cre c57BL/6J mice are used for all experiments. For optogenetic studies, adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing Cre-dependent eNpHR3.0 was injected bilaterally into the vCA1, followed by fiber optic implants. For calcium imaging studies, AAV containing Cre-dependent GCaMP6f is injected unilaterally into the vCA1 followed by implantation of a gradient index (GRIN) lens. Mice then freely explored various environments that included innately anxiogenic zones, fearconditioned contexts, or palatable rewards in familiar or novel environments. During behavioral tests, inhibitory opsins on PV cells were stimulated by timed light delivery in optogenetic experiments. For calcium imaging experiments, calcium signals from PV cells was imaged using miniaturized microscopes. At the end of optogenetic experiments, mice explored either an open field or sucrose gustometer while light was delivered to active or control opsins. Animals were perfused 90 minutes later and brain tissue was collected. Local vCA1 activity levels during eNpHR3.0 stimulation of PV cells was assessed using immunohistochemical staining and quantification of cFos expression.",

While treatments like cognitive-behavioral therapy are effective at reducing overall anxiety, they are largely ineffective in reducing worry severity in older adults. In this study we investigate the neural basis of both induction and reappraisal of worry using an in-scanner personalized worry task. We identified several regions that were associated with worry severity and conducted an openlabel treatment using intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) [a form of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)] of an identified target in 5 participants. Methods: We recruited 36 individuals age 50 and older, with varying degrees of worry severity (as measured by the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, PSWQ). Based on the clinical interview with each participant, we built a participant-specific list of worry induction and worry reappraisal sentences. These sentences (one per block) were presented to participants during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with fixation in between blocks. Worry induction blocks were followed either by neutral blocks (control condition, included random factual sentencese.g., \"fish live in the ocean\") or by worry reappraisal blocks. Following each block, participants rated their worry severity (1-5). After motion correction, spatial normalization to a standard anatomical space, and smoothing we conducted mass-univariate general linear modeling to model worry induction, reappraisal, and neutral blocks. We then parametrically modulated each block by the in-scanner worry severity rating in order to identify regions of activation associated with worry ratings following induction/ reappraisal. We also modeled 6 parameters of motion and the mean, along with an autoregressive, AR(1), model to account for unmodelled/aliased noise and a discrete high-pass filter (1/128Hz) to account for drift. Using statistical non-parametric mapping (SnPM12), we performed a paired t-test to identify regions that were significantly more parametrically modulated during worry induction compared to worry reappraisal. We also conducted paired t-tests to identify regions that were activated more during worry induction and reappraisal compared to neutral. SnPM computes non-parametric p-values which are then corrected using a cluster-wise inference method (cluster forming threshold of p < 0.001) that controls the family wise error rate (FWE) at \u03b1 = 0.05.",

Background: The ability to flexibly respond to changes in the environment is critical for adaptive behavior. Reversal learning is a form of associative learning that tests the ability of an organism to change responses when contingencies are altered. For example, conditions that were once rewarding may become threatening and vice versa. Successful reversal learning is thought to be mediated by cortico-striatal and medial temporal lobe (MTL) systems. Interestingly, a previous study in patients with confirmed MTL atrophy reported specific deficits in reversal of contextual associations, but intact reversal of cue associations, independent of the outcome valence. Reversal learning of contextual versus cue associations may rely on different components on this system; however, this has not been investigated.",

Human studies using actigraphy-based tracking in real time have revealed the central role of disturbances in motor activity in mood disorders, particularly Bipolar Disorder (BD) that is characterized by dysregulation of patterns of motor activity. Likewise, the atypical subtype of depression, characterized by overeating and oversleeping is associated with disrupted patterns of both activity and sleep based on objectively tracked assessments). At present, there are well-established methods for measuring motor activity in different species, such as nonhuman primates and rodents. However, the widespread variability of tools limits comparisons across these studies as well as applying the findings to human research. This presentation will examine the use of actigraphy in humans and monkeys as a first step in developing cross species approaches to examine patterns of motor activity. Second, we present data on the definitions, measures and correlates of motor activity in rodents based on infrared motion detectors. Methods: Patterns of motor activity based on accelerometry using a Phillips accelerometry device was collected across twoweek period in humans (n = 339) (65% female and mean age of 41) and one week in adult female rhesus monkeys (n = 35; 16-24 years of age).

Background: The human prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a region of the cerebral cortex expanded in primates and associated with higherorder cognitive function including abstract thinking, moral reasoning, and language. Dysfunction in the PFC has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric diseases including ASD and schizophrenia. Comparative analyses of the PFC have identified human-specific changes in cell number, morphology, and types as well as microcircuitry and long-range connections, which are thought to underlie human advanced cognitive capabilities and possibly, susceptibility to disease. These changes in circuitry are likely mediated by divergent changes in spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression and cis-regulatory element activity, most evident during early fetal and mid-fetal stages. Linking these genomic changes with human-specific changes in cortical anatomy will be integral to modeling and understanding development of human and primate-specific cortical circuitry, as well as how dysfunction in this circuitry lead to neuropsychiatric disease. However, this process has been arduous due to difficulty accessing high-quality human and primate expression data. To remedy this problem, our laboratory along with multiple other laboratories have created a spatiotemporal atlas of gene expression in humans and macaques spanning from embryonic ages to adulthood, as part of the PsychEncode initiative, called BrainSpan. Using this database, we are able to identify candidate genes differentially expressed in the human and primate PFC during important periods of development, which can be then be studied in animal models to identify their role in development and dysfunction of the cerebral cortex. Methods: We used the BrainSpan database to identify genes and signaling pathways enriched in the frontal lobe during midfetal development, a crucial developmental period for the formation of neuronal circuits with an enrichment of expression of genes implicated in schizophrenia and ASD. Expression of select candidate genes was further profiled in various species including mouse, macaque, and human using In Situ Hybridization and RNA-sequencing. In addition, we utilized comparative genetics combined with both in vitro and in vivo assays to identify noncoding elements that underlie these species-specific shifts in expression. Finally, we studied the function of select candidate genes and regulatory elements in mouse using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and in utero electroporation combined with a diverse set of assays including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and RNAsequencing to study the functional significance of this network.",

Pathway analysis identified that many of these enriched genes are regulated by the same upstream signaling pathway, whose function in later cortical development has not been explored. Reduction in activity of this signaling pathway in the early postnatal mouse medial frontal cortex leads to selective loss of reciprocal thalamocortical connectivity both through DTI (135.3 fibers in WT to 14 fibers in Mutants; p <0.001, n = 5) and lipophilic tracing (n = 3) at both P5 and P30. Furthermore, expansion of this signaling pathway in mouse frontal cortex, to replicate the lateral expansion of activity of this signaling pathway seen in humans, leads to an increase in the thickness of layer IV in motor regions. In addition, we identified an enhancer regulated by this pathway with a hominini-specific (human, great apes) deletion. Targeted replacement with the human enhancer in mouse leads to increased excitatory synapses of both upper (39.5%; P< 0.05; n = 5) and deeper layers at P0 (47.9%; P < 0.0005; n = 5) and selectively in the deeper layers at P30 frontal cortex (21.4%, P < 0.005; n = 3).",

It receives unidirectional inputs from the cortex which dictate its functional organization in 'sensorimotor', 'cognitive', and motivational ('limbic') sectors along a dorsolateral to ventromedial gradient. Newer work shows that there is a broad overlap of 'limbic' and cognitive inputs to the primate striatum, consistent with massively expanded cortical regions devoted to cognitive function in this species. One complex limbic-cognitive task for both human and nonhuman primates is living in social groups. In humans, specific striatal sectors in humans are activated by social interactions ranging from gazing at 'beloved' child or romantic partner, performing altruistic acts, tasks requiring learning to trust another, and the experience of rejection. We assessed the literature to determine striatal sites implicated in these functions in humans, and used Macaques to place retrograde tracer injections in each region. Our goal was to assess the range and combinatorial profile of cortical inputs across striatal zones associated with social activity.",

In this study, we investigated a potential protein-protein interaction between D1R and SynGAP, and its role in GABAergic interneuron migration and physiological consequences in the behaviors of adulthood. Methods: Co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down were carried out to investigate the D1R-SynGAP interaction and its regulation of D1R signaling. An interfering peptide (TAT-D1Rpep) was developed and injected into pregnant mice during the occurrence of GABAergic interneuron migration. Immunofluorescent staining was used to analyze the distribution of GABAergic interneurons at various developmental stages. Locomotor, prepulse inhibition, visual discrimination and social behaviors were assessed to determine whether the prenatal impairment of GABAergic interneuron migration caused behavioral deficits in adulthood.",

Despite significant efforts in the past decade to foster translational medicine efforts in FXS, no approved treatments for FXS exist and numerous drugs have failed to meet primary outcomes in Phase II and III study. One challenge in FXS treatment development is a lack of rigorous, synchronized outcome readouts across animal and human study. We have developed across the mouse (fmr1 KO) and human FXS lab EEG evaluations that 1) present stimuli in a similar manner; 2) have EEG data processed using the same analysis methods across mouse and human study; and 3) show baseline results indicating a similar aberrant patterns of brain activity across mouse and human study. Specifically, we have noted consistent excessive resting state gamma band activity in both humans with FXS and in the fmr1 KO mouse model of FXS. We now will evaluate the sensitivity of EEG abnormalities in humans with FXS and in the mouse model of FXS to change following a single-dose treatment regimen. In FXS, disturbance of the balance of glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling has been consistently reported. Specifically, potentiation of GABA B signaling via treatment with the GABA B selective agonist arbaclofen has been extensively studied in FXS across murine and human study. Racemic baclofen has been extensively evaluated in the mouse model of FXS and racemic baclofen is readily available for immediate use in human FXS study. We now report on evaluation of single-dose racemic baclofen on EEG signatures in FXS across mouse and human study. Methods: Fmr1 KO mice (n = 10) and 10 wild type mice (both C57BL/6 background) were implanted with a commutator and headstage based 30-channel multi-electrode array EEG probe. Following surgical implantation at 80-85 days and then two days to recover the mice underwent pre-dose 5 minutes of resting EEG followed by 300 trains of the up chirp auditory entrainment paradigm. Then a racemic baclofen 5mg/kg I.p dose was given and 1 hour post-dose the EEG paradigms were repeated. For chronic daily dosing, the mice received the same baclofen dose daily for 2 weeks and then EEG paradigms were repeated after repeated dosing. In humans, thirteen 15 to 55-year olds years with full mutation received 30mg of oral racemic baclofen or matching placebo with a two week washout period between dosing days. Prior to drug dosing the patients completed resting state and auditory chirp EEG paradigms consistent with the EEG work in the mice. Four hours post-dose the humans repeated all EEG measures. In addition, the humans completed pre-and postdose clinical measures including the Woodcock Johnson auditory attention subscale, the Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychiatric Status (RBANS), the KiTap computer-based continuous performance testing, and eye tracking.",

Single 30mg baclofen dosing was well tolerated in the human study without significant adverse effects noted.

Early identification of adolescents at risk for depression is critical to prevention efforts. Adults with depression show smaller volumes of the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus, yet larger volumes of the cerebellum and lateral ventricle. Whether these neural features are present in adolescents with depression, or develop after its onset, is unclear. The additive role of trauma and stress is also important to consider. The National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) provides an ideal design to longitudinally study these neural features in adolescents who develop depressive symptoms compared to non-affected peers, with a cohort of 831 youth initially assessed at ages 12-21 years, half at elevated risk for mental health and/or substance use during adolescence, all followed annually.",

Several stress animal models have been used to study the neurobiology of this disorder, including learned helplessness (LH), in which susceptible animals show a failure to escape a noxious stimulus along with a downregulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) system activity. In LH, the prelimbic portion of the prefrontal cortex (plPFC) is known to regulate stress and anxiety, and as such plays an important role in the modulation of helpless behavior, but so far there is no evidence indicating that its developmental disruption alters susceptibility to this behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of plPFC lesion, performed at adolescence or adulthood, on the susceptibility to helpless behavior and its corresponding effects on VTA DA system activity in rats. Methods: Male adolescent (PND 31-33) and adult (PND 70-72) Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to plPFC lesion surgery (ibotenic acid injection) and during adulthood ( > PND 65) or 1 week later were evaluated in the elevated plus-maze. Two days after, the rats were submitted to the LH model to evaluate helpless behavior. Electrophysiology recording of DA neurons in the VTA in adult rats was performed after four days of LH. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh.",

Experience during this early life period plays an important role in shaping the maturation of the brain. Exposure to early life adversity is implicated in increased susceptibility to many neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and addiction. These processes are themselves linked to dysfunction of neuromodulatory systems. In particular, the serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) exert widespread and complex neuromodulatory effects that are necessary for fine-tuning neural circuit formation. While it is known that serotonin regulates a wide range of brain functions and behavior, it is not clear how their circuits regulating serotonergic function are modulated by development and earlylife experience. Methods: Here, we used slice electrophysiology to characterize the maturation of synaptic inputs received by serotonergic and GABAergic neurons in the DRN from juvenile to adult developmental stages in mice. To examine the consequences of early life stress, we also subjected mice to a limited bedding and nesting protocol from PND 4-11.

However, a core symptom across autism-spectrum disorders are repetitive locomotor behaviors. Autism is a highly genetic disorder, and a frequently associated genetic variant with autism is 16p11.2 hemideletion. In a mouse model of 16p11.2 hemi-deletion, we have previously observed male-specific deficits in simple rewardguided learning and molecular function in the striatum. We therefore questioned whether molecular dysfunction in the striatum in these animals may be a common mechanism leading to both simple repetitive behaviors or stereotypies, as well as more complex compulsive behaviors in reward-guided decision making tasks. Methods: In male and female mice modelling 16p11.2 hemideletion, we assessed inflexible behaviors in two tasks. In our first cohort, we measured delay discounting to assess compulsive choice in reward guided decision making. In our second cohort, we measured amphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization to assess striatal dopaminergic function and resulting behavioral hyperactivity.",

In amphetamine locomotor sensitization, wildtype mice increased their distance traveled, reflective of psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity, but this was suppressed in 16p11.2 hemideletion.

Background: Adolescence is a critical period of development when symptoms of many psychiatric illnesses, including depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders, first emerge (Belfer ML, 2008) . These nascent clinical symptoms frequently entail dysregulation of the reward system, manifestations of which include anhedonia (i.e. inability to experience pleasure) and impulsivity. A growing body of literature indicates that the habenula (Hb), a small nucleus bordering the dorsomedial thalamus, plays a critical regulatory role by inhibiting dopaminergic reward signaling (Boulos LJ et al, 2016) . In animal models, Hb stimulation induces depressive phenotypes, whereas Hb inhibition and lesions result in impulsive behaviors (Proulx CD et al, 2014) . Despite these promising preclinical findings, the human Hb remains poorly understood due to its small size, which makes it difficult to study with traditional fMRI approaches. Nevertheless, high-resolution fMRI work by our group and others has reported altered Hb responses to aversive task outcomes (Lawson RP et al, 2017) and resting-state functional connectivity patterns (Ely BA et al, 2016) in people with depressive symptoms. Building on our recent study mapping whole-brain Hb connectivity in healthy young adults using optimized Hb seeds and neuroanatomically accurate cortical surface-based analysis (Ely BA et al, 2019), we examined Hb connectivity and its association with psychiatric symptomatology in adolescents. Methods: Subjects consisted of 87 adolescents (age \u00b1 SD = 15.2 \u00b1 2.1, range = -20): 19 healthy controls and 68 with significant clinical symptoms, primarily related to anxiety, depressive, and/or behavioral disorders. Diagnoses were confirmed by clinician via semi-structured interview (K-SADS-PL). All subjects completed self-reported questionnaires to assess depression (BDI), anxiety (MASC), and anhedonia (SHAPS) severity. MRI was performed on a 3T Siemens Skyra with a 16 channel head coil using sequences similar to the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Lifetime protocols, including 0.9mm isotropic anatomical T1w MPRAGE and T2w SPACE scans as well as 10 minutes of restingstate fMRI (2.3mm isotropic, TR = 1s, 600 volumes, multiband factor = 5).",

Recent progress in deciphering the mechanisms of cortical folding-which are likely relevant to psychopathophysiology as folding is subtly altered in many neuropsychiatric illnesses -leave unexplained whether spatially-patterned genetic influences contribute to folding. Stereotyped folding in specific cortical locations could be explained by a corresponding pattern of genetic influences mediated by molecular gradients, and alterations to such gradients could plausibly mediate genetic risk for disease, but no direct evidence supports this explanation. Perhaps surprisingly, this gap in knowledge can potentially be addressed using in vivo brain MRI of adult participants. Recent imaging studies suggest that shared genetic influences during development are expected to create co-variability of cortical thickness in adult neuroanatomy. Several features of cortical thickness do track folding patterns, and MRI can be used to estimate genetic correlations in inter-regional cortical thickness (co-variability due to shared genetic factors in family-based studies). Progress has been hampered by the fact that shared genetic influences related to folding patterns are likely to operate at a sub-centimeter scale that is much more local than that addressed in prior neuroimaging studies, requiring the development of novel methodological approaches to examine local genetic influences on cortical thickness.",

Critically, there was high anatomical correspondence between results based on analyses of HCP or GOBS datasets (Pearson's correlation, r = 0.55, Pspin<0.001). The overall, phenotypic local correlation was largely driven by shared genetic factors and was highly symmetric between left and right cortical hemispheres (r = 0.8, Pspin<0.001). Furthermore, the degree of local cortical folding related systematically with the strength of local correlations, which tended to be higher in gyral crests and lower in sulcal fundi (r = 0.3, Pspin<0.001).

More recently, examination of developing hippocampal circuitry has become a point of focus, in order to probe the effects of substance use initiation, as well as emotion regulation and adaptive learning. The objective of this study was to evaluate relationships between hippocampal activation, and vulnerability and resilience factors in healthy adolescents, prior to the onset of substance use or the presence of depression or anxiety. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at 3Tesla during performance of a virtual water maze task in alcohol and drug na\u00efve healthy adolescents recruited locally to participate in a three-year longitudinal study of brain development. Baseline task fMRI data from the full sample are presented, as well as longitudinal findings from a subgroup of adolescents who also completed a one-year follow up (n = 32, 15 female, 13.7 \u00b1 0.8; 14.9 \u00b1 0.9 years old). Participants completed tests assessing vulnerability and resilience factors. Vulnerability factors included childhood maltreatment, family history density of an alcohol use disorder, age of initiation of substance use, perceived rejection and stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, impulsivity, and parental perception of internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

To assess the parentchild relationship security, the child filled out the Security Scale questionnaire twice, once for the relationship with his/her mother and once for the relationship with his/her father. The child's SCRs for each stimulus (CS + Parent, CS + Stranger, CS-) was modeled using linear regressions. We first tested whether the parent-child relationship security influenced the child's SCRs to each stimulus, separately for the mother and the father. We then tested the interaction between the parent-child relationship security and the child's gender. Simple slope tests were used to decompose significant interactions.",

While the genetic contributions to idiopathic ASD are heterogeneous and largely unknown, the causal mutations for syndromic forms of ASD, including truncations and copy number variants, provide a genetic footing with which to gain mechanistic insights. Models of these syndromic disorders have been used to better characterize the downstream molecular and physiological processes disrupted by these mutations with the expectation these phenotypes will translate to idiopathic forms of ASD. To begin to identify pathophysiology underlying ASD, we studied a mouse model and patient-derived induced pluripotent stems cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with Pitt Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS) which is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) gene. Methods: RNA sequencing was performed on five independent mouse models of PTHS syndrome (Tcf4+/tr, Tcf4R579W, Tcf4del5740579, Actin-Cre::Tcf4+/floxed, Nestin-Cre::Tcf4 +/floxed) and differentially expressed genes were used in subsequent gene ontology enrichment and cell type-specific expression analysis (CSEA). In addition, we analyzed differentially expressed genes obtained from PTHS mouse models with two other ASD mouse models, harboring mutations in MeCP2 and Pten. We then compared our PTHS mouse models with sporadic human ASD by comparing DE genes to Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) ASD risk gene database and we also searched for overlap using weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNAs) from postmortem human ASD RNA sequencing data. Biological validation of transcriptional signatures from the PTHS mouse model was performed using a variety of techniques including immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, and electrophysiology. Human iPSCs from four PTHS patients were reprogrammed from fibroblast and all contain single point mutations within the basic helix-loop-helix domain of TCF4. iPSCs were differentiated into oligodendrocytes for downstream immunocytochemistry and qPCR studies.",

Furthermore, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize myelination in the corpus callosum (CC) of Tcf4 + /tr and Tcf4 + / + littermates, observing a significant decrease in the proportion of myelinated axons in the CC of Tcf4 + /tr mice compared to Tcf4 + / + littermates (N = 9, p = 0.046). When comparing compound action potentials (CAP) using electrophysiology, we show the ratio of N1/N2 is significantly reduced in the Tcf4 + /tr mice compared to Tcf4 + / + littermates (N = 30; p = 0.0012), indicative of a greater proportion of CAP traveling down unmyelinated axons. Moreover, we integrated syndromic PTHS mouse model DEGs with human ASD genes (SFARI) and human idiopathic ASD postmortem brain RNA-seq, and found significant enrichment of overlapping DEGs and common biological pathways associated with myelination. Remarkably, we show that DEGs from syndromic ASD mouse models can be used to identify human idiopathic ASD cases from controls (p = 0.044).

Background: Suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth in the US. As suicidal and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors and suicidal ideation are factors that strongly predict suicide deaths, extensive effort has been invested in developing suicide prevention interventions that aim to at reduce these factors. However, recent evaluations of the effectiveness of these interventions resulted in contradicting conclusions that may be due to methodological issues. The present study applied a rigorous meta-analytic approach to evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for effectiveness of interventions to reduce suicidal behaviors and ideation among youth. Methods: Five search engines (PubMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were used to search for RCTs published in English between 2004-2019, concerning psychosocial interventions with a primary outcome of reducing suicidal ideation (SI) and/or selfharming behaviors (SB) in youth aged 10 to 18 years. Studies focusing on a specific clinical population defined by diagnosis, and those with inadequate data for analysis either in the published article or through personal communication were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed in R (v. 3.3.2). For each study, we analyzed SB and SI separately. Here we report on preliminary data for SI only. Treatment effects were estimated as difference in SI = Ytrial -Xtrial, where Ytrial and Xtrial represent post-intervention SI values for the treatment and control groups, respectively (assuming equivalent baseline values for the groups). We modeled the occurrence of SI for each subject as a gamma mixture of Poisson processes, estimating the parameters (using method of moments) and Cohen's d. The standard error (SE) was estimated using a parametric bootstrap: Cohen's d was computed for each of 1,000 data sets generated based on the fitted model; the SD of the 1,000 Cohen's d's is our estimate of the SE. Mixed-effect models were used, adjusting for author confounds, study duration, treatment intensity, and baseline exposure. Within-subject correlations were estimated at 0.3.",

Multiple behaviors with relevance to fragile X syndrome, several of which overlap with those observed in ASD, are impacted by striatal function, including repetitive behavior and decreased sociability. However, much of our understanding of FMRP, an RNA-binding protein, is based in studies of hippocampal and cortical neurons, where its loss is associated with impaired synapse elimination and increased numbers of immature dendritic spine types (i.e., filopodia, thin). FMRP RNA-binding domains include the RGG box, which attaches to G-quartet structures, and KH domains (e.g., KH1, KH2), which bind kissing complex structures. In hippocampal slice culture, the KH2 RNA-binding domain, but not the RGG box, is required for FMRP-mediated synapse elimination. In contrast, we have observed a loss of stable (e.g., stubby) dendritic spines across multiple striatal subregions in adult Fmr1 KO mice, suggesting that FMRP's role in striatal cell populations may be different than in cortex and hippocampus.",

Furthermore, our findings show that the process of FMRP-driven synapse elimination in striatal cells relies on a different RNA binding domain than previously reported for hippocampus, suggesting the involvement of different RNA partners and/or cellular processes of FMRP in striatum. Ongoing work is focused on further characterizing these differences.",

Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction/communication along with restricted and repetitive interests/ behaviors. ASD is caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Current mechanistic hypotheses, based on converging findings from clinical neuroimaging and human post-mortem brain analyses, attribute the pathophysiology of ASD to widespread disruptions in brain connectivity. De novo nonsense (Q857X) and de novo missense (G900S) mutations (Sanders et al, 2012; Kong et al, 2012) in EPHB2 were discovered in two autistic individuals. EPHB2 is a gene coding for a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase involved in major axon tract formation, axon guidance and axon pruning, synaptogenesis and synapse plasticity. Methods: To identify new mutations in EPHB2, whole-exome sequencing of~800 ASD patients from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) and of~800 unrelated neurotypical individuals from the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) dataset was performed. Different plasmids expressing each of these mutations were generated in the mouse EphB2 gene, transfected into a human transformed cell line and the mutated proteins were analyzed by western blot. To investigate the role of EphB2 in autism, a battery of autism-associated behaviors, including social interaction, pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), locomotor activity, open field, elevated plus maze, fear conditioning, acoustic startle response, startle response to foot shock, was tested on global EphB2 heterozygous loss-of-function mice. A myelin stain was finally performed on global EphB2 heterozygous brain sections to assess potential malformations of the major axon tracts. Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.",

Moreover, users are often characterized by high levels of externalizing behaviors, comorbid substance use and psychopathology, thus limiting causal interpretations regarding potential neurotoxic effects of cannabis use.

Better treatments for adolescent depression are urgently needed. We have previously shown that ketamine has short-term efficacy compared to midazolam for depressive symptoms (measured via MADRS) in a treatment-resistant population of adolescents. In adults, ketamine also reduces implicit measures of mood disturbance (via implicit association tasks (IATs), and specifically reduces the symptom domain of anhedonia. It is currently unknown whether ketamine has similar effects in the pediatric population. Pediatric metabolism of ketamine at subanesthetic doses has also not been well characterized. Methods: We conducted a randomized, midazolam-controlled crossover trial (n = 17) to evaluate the effects of ketamine in treatment-refractory adolescent MDD over four weeks. Adolescents (13-17 years old) must have failed at least one adequate trial of a standard antidepressant to enroll. On day 1 and day 14 adolescent received either ketamine (0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (0.045mg/kg over 40 minutes). Subjects stayed on their psychiatric mediations, with stable dosing for the four weeks prior to the trial and the duration of the trial. We have previously reported the primary outcome, MADRS score at 1 day following infusion between midazolam and ketamine; secondary outcomes of the trial included measures of anxiety, anhedonia, and hopelessness. A subset of subjects (n = 12) took IATs at baseline and 24 hours post infusion assessing the following 4 constructs: 1) Depression; 2) Suicide/death; 3) Self-harm; 4) Anxiety. D scores from the 24 hours post infusion IATs for both ketamine and midazolam were compared for all 4 IAT measurements.

It is one of the healthiest periods of the life-span, yet morbidity and mortality rates increase 200%, often attributed to natural tendencies to explore and take risks which increase vulnerability to risky and dangerous behaviors. Previous studies have shown that the reward system is stimulated by a rapid increase in dopaminergic activity at puberty, which influences reward-seeking behavior. However, the exact neurobiological deficits remain unknown, especially in African-American youth, who are disproportionately affected by the negative consequences associated with risk-taking behavior in our society. Methods: In an ongoing investigation, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired during the Wheel of fortune (WOF) task involving monetary rewards to assess dorsal striatal activation in response to high-risk choices in 66 medication-free, African-American youth (ages 11-14 years) with no personal or family history of psychopathology.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), one of the surgical procedures, limits caloric intake which is the main driver for the initial weight-loss during the immediate post-surgical period, and it also induces a sustained shift away from consumption of high-fat/sweet food and weight-loss. Though neuroimaging studies have revealed alterations in homeostatic/hedonic/control neurocircuits in obese patients' post-surgery, the neural mechanisms underlying sustained weight loss remain unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that improved connectivity of prefrontal regions, which are involved with self-regulation and salience attribution postsurgery would be associated with sustained weight loss. For this purpose, we performed fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and used a food-cue reactivity task with high-(HiCal) and lowcalorie (LoCal) food-cues to localize the frontal-limbic regions involved in food-cue processing. We used these regions as seed masks to calculate their structural connectivity (SC) and their association with brain activation and behavior. Methods: Twenty-five obese patients who underwent LSG (SG) and 30 age-and sex-matched normal weight controls underwent 3T MRI. SG group was tested before (PreSG) and one-(PostSG_1)/ six-month (PostSG_6) after LSG. The food-cue reactivity fMRI task was conducted 12-hours after fasting. One-way ANOVA was used to assess LSG time effects on brain responses to HiCal and LoCal food-cues. Regions of interest (ROIs) were identified for subsequent Psychophysiological interaction analyses (PPI) to assess alterations in task-related functional connectivity (FC), and to examine the association with weight loss. For DTI, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean, axial and radial diffusivity were calculated, and fiber tracking analysis between the ROIs was performed (threshold: PFWE<0.05, minimum cluster size of k=50, cluster-forming threshold P<0.001).",

Dopamine (DA) is central to impulsivity, as posited by human neuroimaging data that highlight differences in DA-rich regions between healthy individuals and those with impulsivity-related disorders. DA is also central to reward processing, learning and motivation. While we understand that motivated behaviors are driven by phasic DA responses to reward information, we have yet to uncover how DA activity could drive the ability to suppress motivated behaviors when they are maladaptive. Methods: We developed a novel cued-reward lick-withholding task in which head-fixed mice must suppress anticipatory licking during a reward predicting cue (2s) in order to earn water reward. Three different auditory cues that predicted three different reward sizes (big, small, none) were randomly interleaved. The cue was restarted as many times as the animal licked prematurely (before the 2 second cue period was over). The total duration of the tone was used as a trial-by-trial measure of the degree of impulsivity. The task accomplishes the following: 1. It places Pavlovian cue responses in conflict with self-restraint, enabling us to study the neural substrates of action impulsivity. 2, It manipulates the degree of impulsivity by manipulating expected reward value, and 3. It provides a quantitative, trial-by-trial measure of action impulsivity that can be precisely related to neural activity. We measured DA neuron activity using fiber photometry, in which fluorescence emitted from GCaMP6f, a Calcium sensor, is used as a proxy for neural population activity. We specifically targeted DA cells by injecting GCaMP6f in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of DAT-Cre transgenic mice. An optical fiber was then implanted in the VTA to collect the bulk fluorescence signal.",

In addition, mice behaved more impulsively in anticipation of the larger reward, despite it resulting in a reduced rate of reward receipt. As expected, neural recordings demonstrate that phasic DA encodes expected and received reward value at reward cue and reward onset, respectively. However, when controlling for expected reward size, DA dynamically encodes the failure to suppress conditioned responses throughout the trial structure. First, cue-induced phasic DA activity is predictive of impulsivity level and may explain trial-to-trial variability in impulsivity. Second, DA ramping during the wait period predicts the onset of impulsive actions in a manner that reflects changes in reward expectation over time. Lastly, impulsive actions lead to greater DA reward responses, suggesting a mechanism for the persistence of this maladaptive behavior.",

All experimental procedures were performed according to the Guidelines for Animal Care and Use at Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine. For subchronic social defeat stress (sCSDS), mice were subjected to 5 daily, 5-min defeats by a novel CD1 aggressor mouse and were subsequently housed across a plexiglass divider to allow for sensory contact. For subchronic variable stress (SCVS), mice were subjected to five different stressors over 5 days to prevent stress habituation. SCVS included 20 random mild foot shocks at 0.45 mA for 10 min (4 mice to a chamber), a tail suspension stress for 1h, restraint stress placed inside a 50 ml conical tube for 6 h within the home cage, fox odor for 2 h, and soiled cage (wet bedding) for 6 h. Behavioral tests (social interaction test and sucrose preference test) were performed during the light phase (9 am to 4 pm), as reported previously (Uchida et al., Neuron 2011; Uchida et al., PNAS 2011) . All behavioral tests were conducted by experimenters who were blind to the treatment conditions of the animal. We used 10-16 mice per group in each behavioral experiment and 5-8 mice per group for biochemical experiments. For virus injections, the AAV vector (0.2 \u03bcl) was injected bilaterally into the mPFC at a rate of 0.05 \u03bcL/min. Mice were allowed to recover for 3 weeks after surgery. For statistical analysis, data were analyzed using an appropriate analysis of variance. Significant effects were followed up with Bonferroni's post-hoc tests. Unpaired t-tests were used for two-group comparisons. In all cases, p values were two-tailed, and the comparisons were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.",

Negative urgency, the tendency to react with frustration or impatience under distressing conditions, largely explains the relationship between RE-related L vlPFC activity and behavioral measures associated with predisposition to bipolar disorder. Importantly, there was no significant relationship between RE-related L vlPFC activity and depression symptoms (HAMD, MOODS Suicidality factor), suggesting that RE-related L vlPFC activity may have utility for assessing specific risk or predisposition for bipolar disorder via its relationships with negative urgency. Our findings thereby improve understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying a specific dimension of psychopathology that predisposes individuals to bipolar disorder, and highlight the importance of RE-related L vlPFC activity as a potential biomarker and target for interventions to reduce negative affective symptoms associated with BD risk. Future studies designed to assess longitudinal changes in hypo/manic symptoms will further clarify the relationship between L-vlPFC activity, ISS, and bipolar disorder.",

                "text": "Keywords Background: Mood and anxiety disorders represent a major disease and social burden worldwide, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. In recent years, an imbalance between central glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors has been proposed to underlie the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation that is associated with the susceptibility to psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression. The GR and MR are members of the ligand-dependent transcription factor family, and represent the main mediators of the negative feedback control of the HPA axis. This occurs primarily at the levels of the hypothalamus and pituitary, but also within the hippocampus. MRs have a 10-fold higher affinity for glucocorticoids than GRs, suggesting different roles for each receptor in the regulation of HPA axis activity. In addition, MRs are largely occupied under basal corticosterone conditions, whereas GR occupancy is increased when corticosterone levels rise during circadian peak or following stress. Moreover, the co-chaperone and psychiatric risk factor FKBP5 is a negative regulator of GR activity, and at the same time a direct target of the GR. Recent evidence also points to a potential regulation of FKBP5 via MR signaling. An imbalance between central GR and MR receptor signaling is proposed to underlie the HPA axis dysregulation that associates with susceptibility to psychopathology. Here we assessed whether FKBP5 modulates HPA axis activity by fine tuning the MR/GR balance in the hippocampus. Methods: We conducted immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH) and RNAscope to map the expression pattern of the MR, GR and FKBP5 in hippocampal sub-regions of C57/B6 mice. In addition, we generated different cell type-specific GR and MR knockout mouse lines to investigate the impact of receptor depletion on hippocampal FKBP5, MR or GR mRNA expression, as well as peripheral corticosterone levels under baseline and acute stress conditions. Mice lacking the GR in glutamatergic forebrain neurons (GR-CKONex-Cre), and mice with a conditional deletion of the MR in hippocampal CA2/CA3 neurons (MR-CKOAmigo2-Cre) or forebrain glutamatergic neurons (MR-CKOCamk2a-Cre) were used. In addition, hippocampal FKBP5, GR and MR mRNA levels were assessed via qPCR following acute treatment of the MR antagonist Spironolactone in C57/Bl6 mice.",

In contrast, the expression patterns of the GR and FKBP5 were more distinct. This was further supported by a positive correlation of FKBP5 and MR mRNA levels in all hippocampal subregions. Interestingly, no changes in FKBP5 mRNA expression were observed in GR-CKONex-Cre mice. In contrast, FKBP5 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in MR-CKOAmigo2-Cre mice (2way ANOVA: genotype x hippocampal sub-region interaction F (3, 16) = 7.66, p < 0.01), while GR mRNA expression was increased (2way ANOVA: genotype x hippocampal sub-region interaction F (3, 16) = 8.76, p < 0.001). Along these lines, deletion of the MR from glutamatergic forebrain neurons (MR-CKOCamk2a-Cre) resulted in significantly decreased FKBP5, and increased GR expression under baseline conditions without affecting circulating corticosterone levels. Acute restraint stress induced a significant increase in hippocampal FKBP5 mRNA levels, which was even more pronounced in MR-CKOCamk2a-Cre mice compared to controls. Interestingly, this stressor resulted in significantly decreased GR mRNA levels in MR-CKOCamk2a-Cre mice, an effect that was not observed in stressed control animals. Although restraint stress increased corticosterone levels in both genotypes, this effect was significantly dampened in MR-CKOCamk2a-Cre mice compared to controls (2way ANOVA: genotype x restraint interaction F (1, 19) = 6.23, p < 0.05). Overnight treatment with the MR antagonist Spironolactone (via drinking water) led to significantly reduced hippocampal FKBP5 mRNA levels in C57/Bl6 mice (T (19) = 2.11, p < 0.05), while MR and GR mRNA expression remained unaffected.",

Irritability typically manifests in the context of frustrative nonreward, i.e., the omission of an expected reward or blocking of a goal (Amsel, 1958; Cuthbert & Kozak, 2013) . Based on these observations and supportive fMRI data in severely irritable youth (e.g., Adleman et al., 2011; Deveney et al., 2013) , alterations in reward processing and frustrative nonreward have been proposed as key neurobiological mechanisms mediating pediatric irritability (Brotman et al., 2017; Leibenluft, 2017) . Reward processing is a multifaceted construct; within this construct, reward learning and its neural substrates have not yet been examined in relation to irritability. In addition, it is unclear whether frustration as an affective context modulates the neural substrates of reward learning in irritability. Here, we developed a novel, child-friendly fMRI paradigm to assess probabilistic reward learning, before and after a frustration induction in the scanner.",

The paradigm presents participants with a series of 2-armed bandit reinforcement learning tasks (80:20 reward ratio), displayed as games at a virtual carnival. In each game, participants learn to select between pairs of stimuli to maximize their monetary rewards, delivered via trial-by-trial feedback. Participants use hand-held grip force devices to make their selections. Halfway through the paradigm, unbeknownst to participants, a separate, rigged carnival game occurs to induce frustration. Participants are debriefed after the task. We are now acquiring fMRI data from an independent transdiagnostic sample of youth varying in irritability (M age=12.9 years; 64% male; current n = 22 youth with DMDD, ADHD, and/or symptoms of irritability and n = 3 healthy volunteers). Level of irritability is quantified using the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI; Stringaris et al., 2012), completed by youth and parents. As data collection is ongoing, preliminary data were analyzed here with respect to task effects and neural markers of irritability and affective context (pre-frustration vs. post-frustration) during reward learning. Whole-brain linear mixed effects analyses in AFNI examined level of irritability and affective context in relation to neural activity during reward stimulus selection, anticipation of feedback, and receipt of feedback (n = 17 with usable fMRI data; voxelwise threshold p < .005; k > =15 [234 mm3]).",

As data collection is ongoing, additional analyses in the larger sample will utilize a computational reinforcement learning approach to examine neural correlates of expected value and prediction error. Background: Inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology and treatment responsiveness of depression. However, the effects of inflammation on depressive symptoms and treatment response may vary by sex and treatment modality. For example, crosssectional studies in depressed patients and suicide attempters show negative associations between the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-8, and severity of mood and anxiety symptoms. We have also previously found that increases in IL-8 occurring over a course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are linked with greater antidepressant response in women, but not men. Like ECT, subanesthetic ketamine administration can also elicit robust and rapid clinical effects in treatment resistant depression. In the current study of treatment resistant depressed patients, we aimed to evaluate whether inflammation, as measured by IL-8 levels, is associated with depressive symptom severity at baseline, whether changes in IL-8 are related to ketamine response, and whether these relationships differ by sex. Methods: Relationships between plasma IL-8 concentration and depression severity as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), were evaluated with linear regression analysis in a cross-sectional sample of patients with treatment resistant depression (n = 108; 58 men, 50 women; mean age 43). Evaluation of sex as a moderator of this relationship was also evaluated. A subset of this sample (n = 45; 16 females, 29 males; mean age 41) went on to receive an open label infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, infused over 40 minutes). In addition to the cross-sectional measurements obtained at baseline, these participants also completed measurements of plasma IL-8 concentration and depression severity (HDRS) 24 hours following ketamine infusion. Some (n = 22) went on to receive additional infusions of ketamine, but only baseline and 24-hour time points were evaluated in the current study. Linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate whether IL-8 change following ketamine infusion varied according to sex, responder status (defined as > 50% reduction in HDRS), or both combined (using two way and three way interaction terms). Linear regression analyses were utilized to follow-up findings from linear mixed models.",

These cellular alterations parallel to robust changes in gene expression in cytokines and a core component of inflammasomes, and markers for activated microglia in the brain, indicative of inflammation. In contrast to chronic cuprizone exposure, several studies have reported that subchronic treatment of cuprizone resulted in cognitive impairment and augmented locomotor in response to amphetamine challenge. Here we investigated the effect of subchronic cuprizone in a wide array of behavioral paradigms. Methods: C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to cuprizone by feeding diet containing 0.2% cuprizone for 10 days, in which the duration is not sufficient to cause demyelination. On day 11, the diet was switched back to normal diet. Starting from day 8, the mice were subjected to an array of behavioral testing consisted of home cage locomotor, zero-maze, Y-maze, 3 chamber social interaction, novelty object recognition, and prepulse inhibition tests. The behavioral tests were completed on day 13 and whole hippocampi were collected on day 14 to analyze molecular markers related to inflammation.",

Bipolar depression (BDD) can be very difficult to treat as many bipolar depressed patients are slower to respond and less likely to achieve remission than patients going through a manic phase. With untreated or treatment-resistant bipolar depression (TRBDD) often leading to detrimental, and sometimes even fatal, consequences to those afflicted, it is critical to investigate efficacious and safe therapeutic methods. A growing body of evidence suggests that mood disorders, including bipolar depression, are linked to immune activation and an elevated inflammatory status. In this study, we sought to enhance treatment response in patients with TRBDD by modulating inflammatory status through the adjunctive use of celecoxib (CBX), a specific cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor. While we assessed a panel of various pro-inflammatory biomarkers, this poster highlights our findings on C-Reactive Protein (CRP), an acute phase reactant and indicator for non-specific inflammation. We sought to determine whether blood levels of CRP could be identified as a potential biomarker of inflammation and predictor of treatment response in a cohort of TRBDD patients. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited study participants who had been diagnosed with BD I or II and who had failed to respond to at least two adequate trials of antidepressants and/or antipsychotic or mood stabilizing medications (N = 47). Treatment resistance was quantified using the Maudsley Staging Method. All participants underwent at least a 2week washout phase and 1-week placebo (PBO) run-in phase. Participants were then randomized into one of the two arms of the study for an 8-week treatment phase. In one arm of the study, participants (N = 27) received CBX, an anti-inflammatory medication, with escitalopram (ESC), an antidepressant. In the other arm, participants (N = 20) received PBO along with ESC. Blood was drawn in all study participants at baseline, week 4, and week 8 of treatment, which was later analyzed using a Zymutest High Sensitivity CRP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit.",

This supports the clinical potential of anti-inflammatory agents for adjunctive treatment and more effective management of mood disorders. Further studies should investigate the use of CBX for psychiatric indications. Consistent with other studies of BD, we found higher levels of CRP in patients with TRBDD as compared to healthy controls. This indicates that CRP could potentially be a useful biomarker for TRBDD. Additionally, in this study, the CBX group had significantly lower CRP levels than the PBO group at the end of the 8 weeks.

Background: Depression is a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder with significant morbidity and mortality due to the risk of suicide. Antidepressants are typically a first line treatment for depression. However, up to one third of adults have treatmentresistant depression (TRD) that does not respond to pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used clinically for TRD for over a decade. However, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of rTMS remain poorly understood. Additionally, depression is a complex condition and it is now widely accepted that besides changes in behaviour, depression in humans also involves disruptions in intrinsic functional connectivity of the brain, measured by restingstate functional MRI (rs-fMRI), neurometabolite levels, measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), and hippocampal volumes, measured by anatomical MRI. Animal models are an indispensable tool for studying etiology, progression, and treatment of depression. However, there is still controversy regarding the validity of using rodent models of human neuropsychiatric disorders. The chronic restraint stress (CRS) model of depression in Sprague Dawley rats has been shown to exhibit similar behavioural, genetic and protein changes that are established in depression in humans. The continuous and predictable nature of this stress closely mimics the every-day stress that people experience, such as daily repetition of a stressful job and social, financial or familial stresses. The aim of this study was to use brain imaging in rats to investigate the validity of the CRS model of depression in terms of functional, neurometabolic and structural changes. We also used elevated plus-maze test (EPM) and forced swim test (FST) to determine the level of anxiety and depression-like behaviours in animals following CRS and following treatment with low-intensity rTMS (LI-rTMS). Here we report preliminary findings on the validity of the depression model and short-term effects of LI-rTMS treatment.",

Significant brain changes after CRS were also detected by MRI: 1) rs-fMRI data revealed hypoconnectivity within the salience and interoceptive networks and hyperconnectivity between the cingulate cortex and cortical and limbic regions; 2) a decrease in sensorimotor cortical glutamate (P < 0.05; 1.41 \u00b1 0.02 to 1.35 \u00b1 0.02), glutamine (P < 0.05; 0.53 \u00b1 0.01 to 0.50 \u00b1 0.01) and combined glutamate-glutamine levels (P < 0.05; 1.94 \u00b1 0.02 to 1.85 \u00b1 0.03) was detected by 1H-MRS; and 3) a decrease in hippocampal volume was detected by volumetric analysis of T2-weighted anatomical MRI data (P < 0.05; 5.873 \u00b1 0.004 % to 5.851 \u00b1 0.011 %).

This may be due to the small sample (n = 5/group). However, in the accelerated LI-rTMS group, significant differences in behaviour were detected compared to sham treatment (also n = 5/group). Specifically, animals receiving active treatment showed less stretching during EPM and less immobility, greater latency, and increased climbing behaviours during FST.",

This report extends the clinical utility of irritability as a symptom domain by evaluating its association with suicidality and identifying its neural correlates in adult outpatients with MDD. Methods: Participants of Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care for Depression (EMBARC) study, randomized to sertraline or placebo, were included (n = 296). Irritability and suicidality were assessed with 5-item irritability domain of Concise Associated Symptom Tracking scale (CAST-IRR) and 3-item suicidal thoughts factor of Concise Health Risk Tracking scale (CHRT Suicidal Thoughts).

Parallel work in humans and NHPs can inform the investigation of approach-avoidance behaviors and corresponding pathophysiology. Previous work with NHPs developed the human intruder paradigm (HIP), which has characterized context-specific, adaptive and maladaptive threat related responses. The HIP consists of three condition: alone (A), no eye contact (NEC) and stare (ST); the direct threat presented in the ST condition tends to elicit threatrelated behavioral activation (e.g., aggression), whereas the more uncertain threat of the NEC condition tends to elicit behavioral inhibition (e.g., freezing, reduced vocalizations).",

Given the burden of this illness, there is immense value in defining molecular markers that may confer PPD risk, symptomology, and heritability in women. Previously, we demonstrated that asymptomatic, ovarian-suppressed women with a history of PPD develop depressive symptoms during withdrawal from, and occasionally during addback of, supraphysiologic levels of estradiol and progesterone (E2 + P4), whereas women without a history of PPD showed no changes in mood despite participating in an identical hormone manipulation protocol (Bloch et al., 2000) . This differential behavioral sensitivity to steroid hormone manipulation may be reflected at a cellular level, a possibility supported by the observation of several alterations in DNA methylation patterns in women with PPD (Kaminsky and Payne, 2014; Mehta et al., 2014). Methods: To investigate possible differences in transcriptional cellular response to changes in E2 and P4 during pregnancy, we derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from blood samples of women with a past PPD (n = 9), and matched asymptomatic control women (AC) (n = 9), with no history of PPD or other Axis 1 psychiatric illness. These women had all participated in a hormone-manipulation protocol similar to the one employed by Bloch et al. to define their ovarian steroid-behavioral sensitivity outside of obstetrical, medical, or social issues that could also be sources of depression. These cell lines were then treated with E2 + P4 (300nM each) in three different experimental conditions: 1) 96hrs of vehicle-treated steroid-free media, to establish a baseline; 2) 96hrs of E2 + P4-treated media, to examine the effects of high levels (addback) of ovarian steroids; and 3) 72hrs E2 + P4-treated media that was then changed to vehicle-treated media for 24hrs, to mimic parturition-induced steroid withdrawal on a cellular level. Following polyAAA selection of the mRNA, cDNA libraries were established and then analyzed for changes in transcriptional response in all three experimental conditions, using wholetranscriptome RNA sequencing. Quality control measures, unsupervised clustering analyses, and EDGE-R analysis of differential gene expression were all performed using an RNA-seq pipeline in R.",

In particular, we saw a profound difference in transcriptional response in the addback (high E2 + P4 condition) phase, where over 850 genes were differentially expressed (FDR corrected p < 0.05) between AC and PPD. In this treatment group, the top hit was the gene IMPACT, which is a translational regulator that ensures constant elevated levels of translation under a variety of stress conditions. This gene was significantly decreased in cases [pFDRCorr = 2.70x10-5, log2(Fold Change) = -2.03]. Further, while the magnitude of this significant decrease in IMPACT was most extreme in the addback phase, the difference was also significant at baseline [pFDRCorr = 0.0012, log2(Fold Change) = -1.73], and trended toward significance during E2 + P4 Withdrawal [pFDRCorr = 0.101, log2(Fold Change) = -1.33].",

Our finding that IMPACT is significantly decreased in women with PPD may suggest a dysregulated ability to translate transcript to protein in these women when they are exposed to supraphysiologic ovarian steroids. Given this preliminary finding, studies are currently underway to test the hypothesis that normal cellular homeostasis is disrupted under the stress of pregnancy or the hormonal changes of the puerperium specifically in women with PPD. Finally, the surprising finding that the most extreme transcriptional differences were during the addback, not the withdrawal, portion of the study are in line with recent work that suggests PPD may begin before parturition. Further studies are currently underway to replicate our findings, as well as identify pathways and networks that would be impacted by an altered ability to regulate transcriptional response. Future studies will also investigate the transcriptomic response of these LCLs to allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid that is currently being administered as Brexanolone as a treatment for PPD.",

Cariprazine, a dopamine D3-preferring D3/D2 receptor and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, demonstrated efficacy versus placebo (PBO) for improving depressive symptoms in 3 phase II/III randomized, double-blind, PBO-controlled studies in patients with bipolar I depression. These post hoc analyses investigated the efficacy of cariprazine on cognitive symptoms in patients from these studies. Methods: Data from 3 clinical trials in patients with bipolar I disorder and a current major depressive episode were pooled. Efficacy outcomes were assessed for the cariprazine 1.5 mg/d, 3 mg/d, and 1.5-3 mg/d groups compared with placebo. Depressive symptoms were assessed by change from baseline to Week 6 in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Cognitive symptoms were evaluated using the MADRS concentration item and the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) cognitive functioning subscale (administered in one study only at Week 8). In addition, overall functioning was assessed using the FAST total score in this study. Efficacy was evaluated in the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) populations as well as in subgroups of patients with cognitive impairment, defined as baseline MADRS concentration item score \u22653 (mild or worse) or \u22654 (moderate or worse) for MADRS outcomes, and as baseline FAST cognitive subscale score of \u22652 on 2 or more items for FAST outcomes.

However, not every individual responds to stressful experiences in the same way. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate individual differences in susceptibility and resilience to early life stress may therefore have great potential to reveal new strategies to treat or prevent the development of psychiatric disorders that have their origin early in life. One potential source of differential stress vulnerability and risk for psychiatric disorders is genetic variation that impacts neurobiological function. Genetic studies in humans have indicated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 5-HT1A gene promoter is associated with increased risk for psychiatric hospitalization and suicide attempts. This variant may lead to altered transcriptional regulation of 5-HT1A, which in turn alters serotonin release from serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei, resulting in decreased serotonin action in brain areas involved in cognition and emotion regulation. We have previously shown that the ventral hippocampus is a crucial mediator of individual differences in stress susceptibility and resilience. In particular, increased activity in the ventral dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus promotes susceptibility to stress-induced anxietylike behavior in mice. To model gene-by-environment interactions that are relevant for individual differences in vulnerability to early life stress, we here used a transgenic mouse model with high-or low expression of 5HT1A autoreceptors in a limited bedding model of early adversity. We then assessed anxiety-like behavior, cognition, and ventral dentate gyrus activity, to elucidate the behavioral-and neurobiological consequences of GxE interactions on susceptibility to early life stress.",

Although social reward, such as peer acceptance, is highly salient for adolescents, neural response to reward has largely been studied in the monetary domain. Testing reward processing in the social domain may be particularly important when considering the neural mechanisms that promote symptoms of anxiety and depression. These symptoms increase dramatically in adolescence, and are associated with alterations in reward-related brain function. Although social stressors often potentiate symptoms of anxiety and depression, direct tests of the association between symptoms and neural responses across reward domains are rare. Moreover, most research examining relations between brain function and reward processing have confounded the intrinsically rewarding experience of being correct with the receipt of positively-valenced outcomes. Yet, symptoms of adolescent anxiety and depression may be differentially associated with dysregulated processing of intrinsic (being correct) and extrinsic (receiving a positively-valenced outcome) rewards across social and non-social domains. Our prior work in late adolescents used well-matched EEG-based tasks to disentangle the brain's response to the intrinsic reward of being correct from its response to positively and negatively valenced outcomes in social (like, dislike feedback) and non-social (monetary gain, loss) domains. Regardless of domain, the reward positivity, an event related potential that indexes cortico-striatal engagement following the receipt of a reward, was blunted with more severe symptoms of depression and potentiated with more severe symptoms of depression. Additionally, more severe symptoms of anxiety were associated with a greater reward positivity to correctly predicting dislike feedback, suggesting a mechanism by which negative peer feedback may be intrinsically rewarding to anxious youth. We extend this work by implementing novel fMRI-based tasks adapted from our prior methods in mid-adolescents with a range of anxiety and depression symptoms.",

On the other blocks of trials, there was a negative valence goal: correctly predict the door that will result in a monetary loss (lose trials). Incorrect predictions resulted in a null outcome. The social task had identical attributes except doors were replaced with photos of age-matched peers. Participants were told that some peers had rated them after receiving a text of their picture. Positive and negative valence goals were to correctly predict which peer had liked (like trials) or disliked them (dislike trials), respectively.

Recent work has tied autoantibodies that bind to neuronal surfaces and synaptic targets, including specific potassium channel-related proteins, to psychiatric symptoms occurring in the context of limbic encephalitides. This has led to the hypothesis that a subset of psychiatric disorders may be caused by latent autoimmune disease. However, a broad survey of autoantibody prevalence within a psychiatric patient population has not yet been performed. Methods: In a cohort of 712 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizoaffective disorder (SZA), schizophrenia, and controls, we measured 9,357 serum IgG autoantibodies to natively-folded proteins using the ProtoArray\u2122 Human Protein Microarray by Thermo Fisher Scientific. We focused a priori, on antibodies against the potassium channel-related protein, leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1), a common cause of limbic encephalitis with psychiatric symptoms. Second, we performed an analysis on 41 other potassium channel-associated proteins included on the array, and finally we performed an arraywide analysis of overall autoantibody burden. For each patient and probe, the presence/absence of an autoantibody was defined based on whether a patient's value fell above or below 3 standard deviations from the mean of healthy control samples. Statistical analysis of individual antibodies was performed using Fisher's exact test based on this presence/absence call. Autoantibody burden for a patient was calculated as the number of 'presence' calls across the set of N probes for a patient (50 in the case of potassium-channel antigens and 9,357 for all antigens in the array).",

Background: Anhedonia, a lack of capacity to experience pleasure, afflicts individuals suffering from depression, schizophrenia, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent evidence indicates that low, sub-anesthetic, doses of the anesthetic ketamine rapidly ameliorate anhedonia, distinct from its capacity to reduce other symptoms of depression. Anhedonia can be separated into different subtypes including consummatory, anticipatory and motivational. Each of these subtypes involves both overlapping, as well as distinct brain circuits. In this preclinical study we investigated the effectiveness of ketamine and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) to ameliorate distinct anhedonia subtypes. Methods: Male Balb/c mice were trained to lever press for a sucrose pellet reward. Following stable responding, mice were placed in a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. Upon stable PR responding, mice underwent a 10-day chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and concomitantly were tested with the PR to test for motivational anhedonia. Consummatory anhedonia was assessed with the sucrose preference and female urine sniffing tests. Mice were then treated with either saline (n = 8-9; 7.5 ml/kg, i.p.), ketamine (n = 8; 10 mg/kg, i.p) or (2R,6R)-HNK (n = 9; 10 mg/ kg, i.p) and subsequently retested on the anhedonia measures. In a different cohort, male C57BL/6 mice underwent chronic CSDS, and were tested for the induction of consummatory anhedonia followed by treatment with either saline (n = 7; 7.5 ml/kg, i.p.) or ketamine (n = 7; 20 mg/kg, i.p.). Sucrose preference was measured daily until recovery of preference was observed.

Background: Maternal mood during postpartum can be dependent on offspring exposure (Feldman et al. 1999) . In humans, the loss of a child can lead to severe grief and depression in mothers (Badenhorst and Hughes, 2006) . In rodents, repeated long duration separations from pups impair maternal behavior and alter emotionality in late postpartum rats (Boccia and Pedersen, 2001) . Both repeated long separations and pup removal shortly (<24-hours) after birth increase immobility duration in the forced swim test (FST) in rat dams, which is interpreted as increased depressive-like behavior (Pawluski et al., 2009; Boccia et al., 2007) . However, the use of the FST as a measure of depressive-like behavior has recently been questioned (Molendjik and de Kloet, 2019); and other measures of depressive-like behavior, as well as effects on dopamine (DA) system function, in rat dams following pup removal remain unexplored. Here we evaluated long-lasting effects of pup removal, and their possible modulation by social context on maternal affect and DA activity. Methods: 3 groups were used: i) dams with pups, ii) dams with no pups, single-housed, iii) dams with pups removed co-housed with another dam. All underwent a behavioral test battery including: sucrose consumption, forced swim, elevated plus maze, and social approach tests during postpartum days (PD) 21-23. In vivo electrophysiological recordings of ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons were performed (PD22-23) in subset of animals used for behavioral testing (EPM, social approach) to measure 3 parameters: number of spontaneously active DA neurons (i.e. population activity), firing rate, and firing pattern (i.e. burst firing).",

Despite these exciting results, the translation of predictive neuroimaging models into clinical practice remains an unmet goal. Challenges to this goal include costs, relevant applications, reproducibly, and the lack of a simple method to evaluate a test's clinical utility. In this study, we apply decision curve analysis (DCA) to two theoretical treatment strategies constructed from the Drysdale et al. data to evaluate the utility of incorporating these approaches in guiding TMS treatment decisions. Methods: TMS outcome and biotype identification data were obtained from the Drysdale et al. study. This data set included 124 individuals with depression treated with dorsomedial prefrontal TMS (utilizing repetitive or intermittent theta-burst TMS). Fortyfive of these subjects (approximately 36%) achieved clinical response, defined as a 50% reduction in symptoms. As noted, this response differed by connectivity-defined biotype at baseline, with Biotypes 1 and 3 achieving higher response rates (65% and 32%, respectively) compared to Biotypes 2 and 4 (12.5% and 15%). Theoretical treatment strategies for identifying TMS responsive patients included treat only Biotype 1 or treat Biotypes 1 & 3.

Treating only Biotype 1 resulted in a sensitivity of 58%, a specificity of 82% and 73% accuracy for identifying TMS responsive individuals. Conversely, treating both Biotypes 1 & 3 resulted in a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 47% and 61% accuracy for identifying responders. DCA analysis revealed that the net benefit of treating Biotypes 1 & exceeded both the treat only Biotype 1 and the \"treat all\" strategies over a range of threshold probabilities between 14% and 32%. For threshold probabilities above 32%, treating just Biotype 1 achieved greater net benefit than alternative strategies. Greater net benefit translates into a higher proportion of successful TMS treatments and reduced cost per response. Assuming a TMS treatment series costs $15,000 and takes 36 sessions, the \"treat all\" strategy currently used costs $41,333 and 99 visits per clinical response. Adding the predictive neuroimaging strategies and an approximate cost of $1,500 and a one-hour visit per MRI scan, the predictive approaches yield reduced costs per response for both strategies (Biotype 1 only: cost $30,231, 60 visits; Biotypes 1 & 3: cost $35,923, 78 visits).",

The strength of DCA is that it bridges the gap between neuroscience research and practical clinical decision-making. Furthermore, it demonstrates that predictive models can be clinically useful without perfect accuracy -as long as they address the right clinical questions.

The studies were included in the meta-analysis if (1) the patients were appropriately genotyped for CYP2C19 or CYP2D6; (2) adequate sorting of patients into NM, IM, and PM was possible; (3) the study included at least three patients per subgroup; and (4) drug exposure was measured in a representative way as (a) dose-harmonized area under plasma level (time) curve, (b) dose-harmonized steady-state plasma levels, or (c) apparent total clearance of the drug from plasma after oral administration (CL/F, reciprocal value represented the drug exposure). Meta-analysis for a specific drug was performed if five or more studies met the inclusion criteria. Based on the outcome of the literature survey, it was possible to perform meta-analysis for escitalopram (N = 2,125), venlafaxine (N = 266), risperidone (N = 1,006), and aripiprazole (N = 824). Drug exposure head-to-head comparisons were made between PM or IM subjects and the NM subject group, which served as a reference. Heterogeneity across the studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test at a given significance level and the percentage of total variability across the studies attributable to heterogeneity was quantified by using I-square value.",

Background: The presence of abnormal immune activity has frequently been implicated in depressed mood and especially major depressive disorder. One theory in particular suggests that inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 can activate a set of neurobehavioral changes referred to as \"sickness behavior\" but that the depression represents the activation of sickness with a specific downstream pathway metabolizing trypophan. In this model inflammation increases the activity of indoleamine-2,3dioxygenase (IDO) which increases the conversion of tryptophan (TRP) to kynurenine (KYN). When kynurenine enters the brain, it is further metabolized down two arms, producing kynurenic acid (KYNA) on the one hand, and quinolinic acid (QUIN) on the other. Activated microglia produce quinolinic acid so under inflammatory conditions the relative amount of quinolinic acid increases. This is thought to produce neurotoxicity leading to depression, and in certain relatively narrow contexts (i.e. cytokine therapies) it has been shown convincingly that tryptophan metabolism plays a role in the progression from fatigue and other sickness symptoms to a full depression syndrome. Previous studies have also shown that this pathway may predict alterations in cognition, and in one case that increased quinolinic/kynurenic acid ratios correlated inversely with hippocampal volume. Based on this data, we hypothesized that KYN/TRP and KYNA/QUIN ratios would predict cognitive performance in depression. Specifically, we predicted that associative memory, mediated by the hippocampus, should be affected, and that performance would decrease as the inflammation associated ratios (KYN/TRP and QUIN/KYNA) increased.",

Background: Whether co-treatments can improve ketamine's efficacy in treatment-resistant depression is still relatively unexplored. Lithium is a common adjunctive treatment for refractory depression, as well as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder. Its molecular mechanisms overlap with those of ketamine and we have previously shown both are moderated by insulin signaling in treatment resistant rat models and human subjects. Here, we aimed to quantify the molecular, cellular, bioenergetic and behavioral effects of ketamine and/or lithium in a rodent model of antidepressant treatment resistance. Methods: To establish an antidepressant-resistant phenotype, male Wistar rats were administered adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 100ug/day, 14 days). Rats were subsequently treated with ketamine (10mg/kg; 2 days; n = 12), lithium (37mg/kg; 2 days; n = 12), ketamine + lithium (n = 12), or control vehicle saline (0.9%; n = 12) and underwent open field (6 minutes) and forced swim (6 minutes) tests. Thirty minutes after behavioral testing, rats were euthanized, and cardiac blood and brain tissue were immediately collected. Peripheral blood and prefrontal cortical tissues were isolated for molecular and bioenergetic analyses. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed to detect mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), glycogen synthase kinase-3\u00df (GSK3\u00df), and glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 1 (GRIA1) concentrations. Oxygen consumption (OCR) and extracellular acidification (ECAR) rates, a proxy of glycolytic rate, were assessed before and after exposure of tissues samples to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Wnt3a, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) using a Seahorse XF analyzer.",

Recent clinical studies suggest that the effects of ketamine may be mediated by the endogenous opioid system. Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists cause negative behavioral affect and dysphoria in animal models and human volunteers. In these studies, we investigated the hypothesis that ketamine administration counteracts these effects, in part by producing a protracted desensitization of KORs that lasts beyond the acute effects of the drug. We examined whether (1) exposure to ketamine produces internalization of KORs in cell culture, and (2) exposure to ketamine leads to desensitized behavioral and electrophysiological responses caused by the activation of KORs 24 h after ketamine administration. Methods: We assessed KOR internalization in HEK293 cells transfected with yPET-OPRK1 plasmids following stimulation for 6 h with the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin, the selective KOR agonist U50,488 (U50), or ketamine. To test whether ketamine desensitizes responses induced by KOR activation, 8-12-week old male C57BL/6J mice were treated with ketamine (0, 10 or 20 mg/ kg, i.p.) 24 h prior to assessment with U50 (0, 10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) on three different behavioral assays.

Ketamine also produced long-term desensitization of KORs in the lateral habenula. This was observed by the ability of ketamine to block U50-induced increased LHb excitability. The LHb is an epithalamic nucleus associated with aversion, and increased activity of the LHb is associated with stress-related disorders. Furthermore, ketamine has been shown to reverse the hyperexcitability of the LHb in numerous early life and chronic stress paradigms.

Thus, we found evidence consistent that the amygdala's responsiveness to emotion can be modulated by inactivation of the corrugator muscles using onabotA.

Based on our results, the feedback from these muscle movements appear to contribute to processing the relevant emotion by the amygdala. Consistent with our predictions, preventing scowling through paralysis of the glabellar region altered amygdala processing for angry faces. Notably, we also found an effect for happy faces, suggesting that paralysis of this region impacted smiling or happy expressions, resulting in alterations in amygdala activity for happy faces as well. The modulation of amygdala and fusiform gyrus activity from the administration of onabotA may reflect compensatory processes engaged in a network of brain regions involved in emotional processing when facial feedback is impaired. While there remains much more to explore regarding the role of facial feedback on amygdala and fusiform gyrus activity for emotional faces, these data contribute to a growing body of literature suggesting that paralysis of facial muscles alters neural activity for emotional processing.",

However, the neural basis by which this occurs remains unclear. Here, we tested if stress-induced neural activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) disrupts subsequent reward processing. Methods: We trained mice to associate a tone with water reward availability (CS + ) and another tone with no water reward (CS-) to a criterion of 70 percent correct responses to the CS + for two consecutive days. After reaching criterion, mice were either stressed (30 minutes of restraint) or unstressed (30 minutes in a familiar environment). To determine the effect of acute stress on the VTA-NAc circuit, we simultaneously recorded single unit and local field potential (LFP) activity in the VTA and LFP activity in the NAc of mice during restraint, familiar environment, and subsequent reward processing. We expressed opsins (channelrhodopsin and archaerhodopsin) by injecting AAV vectors into the VTA of VGAT-cre, VGLUT-cre and DAT-cre mice. We analyzed the data using custom MATLAB scripts.",

During restraint, a prominent low-frequency oscillation emerged in the NAc that was not seen in the familiar condition (Wilcoxan sign rank test, p < 0.001; n = 21 mice). Lag analysis of VTA multi-unit activity revealed that VTA activity precedes this oscillation, and pharmacological inhibition of the VTA with muscimol prevents this oscillation. Optogenetic inhibition of neuronal subtypes within the VTA further revealed that VTA GABA neurons contribute to this stress-induced oscillation. We therefore hypothesized that optogenetic stimulation of VTA GABA neurons at the oscillation frequency would produce similar effects to restraint stress. Indeed, we found that this manipulation increased NAc LFP power at the stress-induced oscillation frequency and produced reward processing deficits similar to those observed after restraint stress. Finally, we find that stress caused a persistent disruption of VTA neural activity underlying reward anticipation.",

In preclinical studies using mice, chronic stress paradigms, such as chronic corticosterone and chronic social defeat stress, are used to induce negative valence behaviors. Chronic fluoxetine (FLX; an SSRI) treatment reverses these stress-induced behavioral changes in some, but not all mice, permitting stratification of mice into behavioral responders and non-responders to FLX. Recently, we reported that 5-HT1A receptors, which are Gi-coupled inhibitory receptors, on mature granule cells (GCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG), are necessary and sufficient for the behavioral, neurogenic, and neuroendocrine response to chronic SSRI treatment.",

One way in which insulin resistance and depression may be linked is through shared or cumulative effects on brain structure, and in particular the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC may be important for understanding the compounding effects of insulin resistance and depression, as research indicates aberrant reward processing in both conditions. Indeed, previous research documented a robust association between depression and ACC structural abnormalities in youth. Moreover, preliminary research suggested a cross-sectional association of insulin resistance with ACC structural abnormalities in youth with depression. However, the prospective effects of insulin resistance combined with depressive symptoms, on the structure of the ACC in the developing brain, are unknown. To extend upon prior crosssectional findings, the goal of the present study was to test the prospective associations of markers of insulin sensitivity after an oral glucose challenge on ACC volume in youth with depression and obesity. Methods: 62 youth aged 9 to 17 (mean = 14.70, SD = 2.18 years) with currently untreated moderate-to-severe depression (Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised [CDRS-R] score > 35) and overweight or obesity (mean BMI-z = 1.77, SD = .55) completed baseline and 6-month follow-up visits as part of a longitudinal study of brain and behavioral correlates of insulin resistance in depression. Participants completed T1-weighted structural MRI scans, tests of insulin resistance (fasting and postglucose challenge [Matsuda index]), and clinical assessments (e.g., CDRS-R, BMI-z score) at both timepoints. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to test changes in ACC volume from baseline to 6-month follow-up, with level of insulin resistance (high versus low) entered as a between-subjects factor to explore whether ACC volume changed as a function of insulin resistance. Baseline age, sex, BMI-z score, depressive symptoms (CDRS-R T-score), and total intracranial volume were entered as covariates. Two separate repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted, given that we tested how two different measures of baseline insulin resistance (fasting and Matsuda index) impacted ACC volume. Alpha level was set to p = 0.025 (0.05/2) to adjust for two statistical tests.",

Following recovery, animals were tested in a series of behavioral paradigms including a Real-Time Place Test (RTPT), Open Field Test (OFT), and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM). For RTPT, mice were placed in a rectangular arena consisting of two adjacent square compartments in which one side gave optogenetic stimulation upon entry and remained constant until the animal exited. Different frequencies (0, 1, 5, 10 or 20 Hz, 10ms, 470nm) were examined over five counter-balanced trials. The time spent in the stimulation-paired side was used to determine place preference. For OFT, mice were placed in an open, square arena and allowed to freely explore for 21 mins. Optogenetic stimulation (5Hz, 10ms, 470nm) alternated over 3-min intervals. For EPM, mice were allowed to freely explore a plus maze containing two open arms and two closed arms for 15 mins. Animals received optogenetic stimulation (20Hz, 10ms, 470nm) in alternating 5-min intervals.

Weather events were examined in relation to these subjects' onset dates. Weather data was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Daily mean weather variables (temperature, dew point, barometric pressure, wind speed, precipitation, cloud cover) were calculated for each of the 60 days prior to a patient's onset. Extreme weather events (defined as 2 to 4 standard deviations from the daily historical mean (from 1980-1999) to control for seasonality and patient acclimatization) were then tabulated for each patient's pre-onset period. After examination of the distribution of the extreme weather events, we created 8 risk periods of 7 days each (total of 56 days) prior to the onset of the psychotic episode. We then fit a longitudinal logistic regression model with the psychotic episode as the binary (yes/no) outcome as predicted by a single term for risk periods (1-8 with 1 being the risk period containing the psychotic episode), an indicator for an extreme weather event, and an interaction term for risk period and extreme weather event. The single term for risk period allowed us to calculate a consistent change in odds ratio of a psychotic episode over risk periods.",

Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D-17). Self-reported affective control and emotional lability were measured using the Affective Control Scale (ACS) and NEO Five Factor Personality Inventory Neuroticism scale (NEO-N). To measure implicit emotion regulation, we used a modified version of the Multisource Interference Task overlaid on affective images from the International Affective Picture System (MSIT-IAPS). During each trial, a three-digit number is presented for 1.7 seconds on the screen. Each set contains two identical distractor numbers and a target number that differs from the distractors. Participants identify with a button press the target number that differs from the distractors. During Noninterference (control) trials, distractor numbers are always zeros, and the identity of the target number always corresponds to its position on the button response pad (100, 020, 003). By contrast, during Interference trials, distractor numbers are always numbers other than 0, and the identity of the target number is always incongruent with its position on the button response pad (e.g. 211, 232, 331, etc.) . Each trial of the MSIT is overlaid on a negative, positive, or neutral image from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), counterbalanced between the control and interference conditions. Thus, participants are required to regulate their attention away from distracting emotion-provoking stimuli in order to perform task goals, a proxy for implicit emotion regulation. Reaction time (RT) during each trial was modeled using a generalized mixed effects linear model (GLMM) with a Gamma distribution. Resting state fMRI data were analyzed using FreeSurfer.",

These changes were significantly related to pre-to post-TMS changes in functional connectivity between the DLPFC target site and limbic networks relevant to emotion regulation. This suggests one mechanism by which HF-rTMS may lead to symptom improvement in depression is through improvements in the neurocircuitry supporting emotion regulation, with observable effects on behavior and self-report. Results from the current study also evidenced a significant relationship between anterior insula-VLPFC functional connectivity and performance on the affective interference task both at baseline and post-treatment, confirming previous evidence that has shown a significant role for the VLPFC in emotion regulation. Future studies will examine the relative effects of DLPFC versus VLPFC stimulation on emotion regulation improvements in mood disorders. We used an intersectional viral vector strategy in rats by selectively transducing the three different output pathways from LHb by injecting AAV8-DIO-hM4Di, AAV8-DIO rM3Dq (coding for Gi-or Gq-coupled DREADDs) or AAV8-DIO-RiboTag (allowing immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing of ribosomeassociated RNAs) into LHb and CAV2-Cre (a retrograde viral vector) into DRN, RMTG, or VTA.

We next examined the impact of inhibiting DRN-projecting LHb neurons on reward sensitivity, perseverative behavior, and anxiety-like behavior using saccharin preference testing, reward omission testing, and open field testing, respectively. There was no effect of inhibiting any of these pathways on reward sensitivity, locomotion or anxiety-like behavior, but inhibiting DRN-projecting LHb neurons reduced perseverative licking during reward omission testing whereas activating these neurons increased perseverative licking.

In this report, we aimed to identify clinically homogeneous MDD subgroups using data-driven statistical methods, evaluate their utility in predicting response to antidepressant versus placebo, and elucidate the underlying neural correlates. Methods: We included participants of Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care for Depression (EMBARC) study with MDD (n = 241) and healthy controls (HC; n = 40) in this report. MDD participants were randomized to 8-week double-blind course of sertraline or placebo. Both MDD and HC participants underwent detailed clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We used principal component analysis to identify shared dimensions across 27 clinical measures (depression-associated symptom domains, childhood trauma, personality traits, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, and functional outcomes). We decided to exclude measures of depression severity (17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, [HAMD-17] and 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive symptomatology Self-Report [QIDS-SR]) as they were used as either outcome measures or eligibility criterion. We then grouped individual participants based on the principal component (PC) to which they contributed the most to (defined as loading score > median). As loading scores for each PC could be positive (+ ) or negative (-), this resulted in two sub-groups per PC. We compared the clinical outcomes (change in HAMD-17) among these groups based on treatment arm. We used functional MRI to compute resting state functional connectivity (FC) after parcellating cortical and subcortical regions in 121 parcels with a total of n = 7260 FC pairs. To identify the neural dysfunction, we compared each subgroup of participants with MDD to HC with two-sample ttest.

We thus examined if Quin and Kyna would be associated with basal ganglia Glu/creatine (GluCr) signals on MRS and whether their interaction would impact depressive symptoms notably anhedonia based on previous results. Methods: Forty subjects aged 21-65 diagnosed with DSM-IV + major depression underwent MRS scans on Day1 and blood sampling and behavioral assessments on Day2. Anhedonia was assessed using a previously validated, subscale of the IDS-SR consisting of 3 items. Single-slice, multivoxel, chemical-shift Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) data were acquired using settings of TR/TE=1590/30ms, voxel=10.3x10.3x15 mm^3, acquisition matrix = 16x16, data points=1024, and averages=7. A 2x3 voxel area in the bilateral subcortical region at the level of basal ganglia was used to obtain metabolite concentrations, and post-processing was conducted using LCModel. Omnibus MAN-OVA models were used to screen for associations between MRS and all kynurenine metabolites followed by linear models adjusting for covariates to test specific associations between GluCr, Quin, and Kyna. Generalized elastic net models (to control for collinearity, variable selection) were used to examine the impact of full-factorial 2-way interactions between GluCr*Quin or Kyna interactions upon anhedonia. A 'balanced auto-validation' technique was used to recode the original data into two copiesone a training set and the other a validation set -that differed in row weightings. The weights were Dirichlet-distributed and balanced to contribute more training and less to validation set (and vice versa).

The FST is an appropriate model to study the pharmacology underlying the behavioral effects of ketamine because it reduces immobility in the FST for days after a single injection, similar to the protracted duration of effects following infusion in MDD patients. We investigated whether (1) the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine are blocked in mice with genetic deletion of KORs (KOR knockout (KO) mice) and (2) whether the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine are blocked by prior administration of the mixed opioid antagonist naltrexone or selective opioid receptor antagonists.

This was illustrated in KOR knockout mice absent the receptor and by pretreating mice with the mixed antagonist naltrexone or the selective KOR antagonist LY2444296 prior to ketamine administration to block the receptor. Acute administration of ketamine has previously been shown to activate KORs. However, the behavioral effects of ketamine were tested at 24 h after ketamine administration, a period coincident with antidepressant effects in humans and when ketamine is no longer present. At 24 h post-treatment, ketamine has caused a reduction of KOR signaling. The blockade of KORs at the time of ketamine treatment may counteract ketamine-induced suppression of immobility in the FST by preventing the subsequent KOR desensitization 24 h later. These results suggest that activation of KORs by acute ketamine injection is necessary for the emergence of behavioral effects in the FST 24 h later and possibly clinical antidepressant effects.",

Background: Our studies show that depression-like behavior (DLB) increases in female rats after a week of housing at moderate altitudes of 4,500ft or 10,000ft vs. at sea level, while male behavior does not change. However, both male and female rats housed at altitude fail to respond to most antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class, the most widely prescribed of antidepressants. People living at altitude are exposed to hypobaric hypoxia, which may cause brain hypometabolism, and a bioenergetic deficit is also linked to major depressive disorder (MDD). Our previous studies show an altituderelated deficit in the brain cellular bioenergetic marker, creatine (CR), in the prefrontal cortex of healthy people living at altitude vs. those living at sea level. A similar deficit is seen in rats after housing for a week at 10,000ft. Our next goal was thus to test the potential of the bioenergetic compounds creatine monohydrate (CrMH) and cyclocreatine (cyCR) to improve depression status in this animal model. CrMH is a bioenergetic compound widely used as a supplement by athletes to enhance energy production and usage in skeletal muscle. Dietary CrMH can improve cerebral energy reservoirs in healthy volunteers, and may improve SSRI efficacy in adult women and treatment-resistant adolescent women. CyCR is a lipophilic analog of CR, which also shows the potential to improve brain bioenergetics, with the added advantage of crossing the blood brain barrier without the need of a transporter, thus exhibiting higher brain bioavailability vs. CrMH. Methods: Female and male rats housed at a moderate altitude of 4,500ft were provided with 5wks of dietary augmentation with 4%w/w CrMH in powdered rat chow. Another set of rats housed at 4,500ft were given 3wks of dietary cCR supplementation (1%w/w). Control animals were fed powdered rat chow for 3 or 5wks (Food controls). After the dietary treatment period, rats were tested for depression-like behavior (DLB) in the forced swim test (FST). Rats were then sacrificed, and blood and brain regions (prefrontal cortex, striatum) were harvested for tissue analyses. Tissue was assayed for CR levels with an assay kit from BioVision (Milpitas, CA). The TCA desipramine (Des) works as an effective antidepressant in rats housed at 4,500ft, therefore was used as a positive control for dietary treatment studies. FST data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA of 3 groups: CrMH, Des and control group. The control group combined saline controls from the Des study and Food controls, which did not significantly differ in FST behavior. Student's t-test was used to analyze tissue CR levels as well as FST behavior of cyCR.",

In our model, the SSRIs Prozac, Paxil and Lexapro do not work in rats housed at 4,500ft or 10,000ft, suggesting that SSRIs may not work in people exposed to chronic hypoxia. In the current study, we show that improving brain bioenergetics may be an effective way to provide more effective antidepressant options for those exposed to chronic hypoxic conditions. Previous CrMH studies, conducted at sea level (Allen 2010), showed a similar sex-based impact on rodent FST behavior: CrMH showed AD potential in females, but not males.

In general, a substantial proportion of these gene changes exhibited a rebound effect, where the gene change at 10hr was opposite that occurring at 24hr after withdrawal of the drug. The ketamine-induced transcriptional changes were largely correlated between male and female animals with a small population of genes in the amygdala being sexually dimorphic in their response to ketamine.

We additionally examined cell types in which the gene changes occur by cross-referencing our dataset to single-cell databases of frontal cortex and hippocampal neurons and non-neural supportive cells such as microglia, astrocytes and endothelial cells. Based on this analysis, we identified widespread changes in genes specific for several subclasses of interneurons, cortical pyramidal neurons, and other neuronal populations. Additionally, we also attributed much of the gene changes to non-neural support cells such as microglia, which appeared to be strongly affected by ketamine infusion.

While, several recent detailed studies have examined ketamine effects at the systems and molecular levels, exploring transcriptional (Bagot et al., 2017), and synaptic (Moda-Sava et al., 2019) effects that greater explain its mechanism (Duman et al., 2016; Zanos and Gould, 2018), the present study extends these findings to include a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional responses. These observations potentially connect ketamine directly with downstream effectors responsible for its psychiatric and analgesic effects and form a comprehensive foundational knowledge base from which to draw on in future studies of this burgeoning drug class. In aggregate our data corroborate that ketamine likely induces an excitatory state, as supported by increased gamma band power on quantitative electroencephalography (Sanacora et al., 2014), increased glutamate neurotransmission (Abdallah et al., 2018) , and increased hippocampal synaptic potentiation in response to ketamine exposure (Nosyreva et al., 2013) .

Background: NMDA receptor hypoactivity has been linked to a range of clinical phenomena, including cognitive dysfunction and alterations in social behavior. Potential treatments for conditions characterized by NMDA hypofunction may involve enhancement of NMDA receptor-related neurotransmission. In a recent suite of target-engagement studies, SAGE-718, an investigational positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, demonstrated effects on electrophysiological and functional imaging biomarkers in healthy volunteers after a low dose ketamine challenge. These findings are consistent with CNS penetrance and functional engagement of the NMDA receptor. Here, the effects of 10-day repeated exposure of SAGE-718 on a core cognitive battery were investigated in healthy volunteers. Methods: Forty subjects were randomized (1:1) to either multiple oral doses of SAGE-718 (n = 19) plus ketamine or placebo (n = 21) plus ketamine, which was delivered in a double-blinded manner [SAGE-718: n = 19, mean (SD) age 42.7 (12.00) years, 15.8% female; Placebo: n = 21, mean (SD) age 42.6 (11.56) years, 15.4% female]. SAGE-718 oral solution or matching placebo solution was administered as a 1.0-mg dose in a fasted condition once daily (between 7 and 10 AM) over the course of 10 days.

We propose an innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional approach on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We are slotted to secure R01 funding (US-South American initiative for genetic-neural-behavioral interactions in human neurodegenerative research) that will support a basic platform anchored in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, that is supplemented with clinical research expertise from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), genomics expertise from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and bioinformatics expertise from HudsonAlpha. We now seek to extend this proposal to collaborators in Mexico and Chile. We also wish to assess novel families across LAC via the Latin America and Caribbean consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD). In addition to the R01 strategy based on patients with familial and sporadic presentations tested for genetic risks (risk scores), it would also support recruitment of AD and FTD families with an autosomal dominant-like presentation from the LAC-CD. In this expanded framework, we would first screen all patients for known AD/FTD/ALS genes and then, for those who screen negative for known genetic causes of disease, we will perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for gene discovery. We will establish a network of AD and FTD families and clinicians/ researchers, enabling large-scale research to identify novel genetic and SES contributions to AD and FTD in diverse populations. Our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in LAC relative to the US, including risk factors, cognitive profiles and brain imaging.",

To date, no study has sought to establish which potential predictors prove more sensitive to discriminate between LAC and US patients. In particular, although genetic risk and SES (Aims 1 and 2) have the potential to robustly differentiate between such samples, no study has explored their role, let alone as compared to other multimodal factors. To address this issue, we will apply data-driven machine-learning analysis to determine top factors that best discriminate patients in LAC from those in the US. Multimodal measures from controls of each country will be used for population-specific normalization of patient data. We hypothesize that the top features, better discriminating LAC from US patients will be related to SES and genetic risk (e.g., standardized PRS) in comparison to other variables (clinical, cognitive, and imaging measures).",

Background: Irritability and aggression are common in Huntington's Disease (HD) patients. These symptoms are highly distressing, adversely impact daily life, and often result in institutionalization. Effective treatments are unavailable and we need well-validated scales for measuring changes in these symptoms to develop these drugs. This Phase II clinical trial in individuals with HD (n = 106), Safety and Tolerability of SRX246 In Irritable/Aggressive Subjects with Huntington's Disease (STAIR; NCT02507284), rigorously evaluates the tolerability of a new drug, SRX246; provides additional safety data; and explores rating scales for the assessment of changes in these symptoms. The test drug, SRX246, is a first-in-class vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist. It exhibits high affinity and selectivity for its target, has a strong safety profile in healthy volunteers and other clinical trials, and excellent pharmacokinetics. Preclinical pharmacology and an experimental medicine fMRI study showed that SRX246 has CNS effects after oral administration and modulates brain circuits involved in responses to stimuli that elicit aggression/fear. In a Phase 2 Exploratory trial for the treatment of Intermittent Explosive Disorder, SRX246 was well tolerated, no serious adverse events were reported, and exploratory analyses revealed statistically significant differences favoring SRX246 in key clinical outcome measures. These findings suggested that SRX246 might have beneficial effects on the irritability/aggression seen in HD patients.",

Background: Identifying biomarkers associated with the rate of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression could improve clinical trial efficacy by reducing study duration and sample size. Whole transcriptome analysis and epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) revealed correlations between the gene expression and CpG probe methylation levels and AD diagnosis and progression as measured by pathology burden in brain samples. We explore here the association of gene expression and DNA methylation in peripheral blood with these endpoints in participants from the longitudinal ADNI study for translational application. Methods: Whole-genome gene expression and DNA methylation profiling was performed in baseline blood samples from~800 and~6 ADNI participants using the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 Array and Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip, respectively. The timing for RNA sampling and DNA sampling may differ and the they may also differ from the clinical study baseline. Rates of decline in cognitive function from initial RNA/DNA sampling visit to subsequent visits were estimated by the slope of robust linear regression of the preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite (PACC) and clinical dementia rating scale sum of boxes (CDR-SB) for cognitively normal (CN) and MCI patients, respectively. Age, sex, and estimated cell compositions were included as covariates in regression analysis using limma to identify differentially expressed and methylated CpG positions (DMPs) associated with the rate of cognitive decline and disease status conversion (i.e. from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to AD). DMPs associated with CN to MCI or MCI to AD conversion were also examined. Enrichment in biological process of DMPs were analyzed using weighted gene set enrichment analysis. Genes located close to top ranking DMPs were analyzed for physical and functional associations using STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) database. Predictive modeling using baseline gene expression data and different tiers of clinical predictors were also used to predict disease stage conversion.",

The IgLON family is composed of five members. They are abundant GPI-anchored cell surface proteins found in brain and they shape synaptic connections. IgLONs interact homophilically and heterophilically with each other as 'synaptic organizers', acting in trans (spanning cellular junctions) and/or in cis on the same cell surface. The IgLON, neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1), is implicated in obesity in humans via SNPs and CNVs, and it is also linked to major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, dyslexia, and autism spectrum disorder. Another IgLON, neurotrimin (NTM), is linked to intelligence and cognitive function. These IgLONs promote neurite outgrowth, migration of neurons to their target brain region, spine formation, dendritic tree formation and adult neurogenesis, but little is known about how they interact with themselves, other IgLONs, and/or non-IgLON partners. It is also not known how they are accommodated in the synaptic cleft of different synapse types and how they carry out their diverse physiological functions.",

The interaction interface between IgLONs is highly conserved in terms of both sequence and 3D-structure, as would be expected for a family of proteins that can form both homodimeric as well as heterodimeric synaptic macromolecular complexes. However, strikingly, only NEGR1 regulates food intake in rats when administered to the PVN in vivo, while other IgLONs do not; this is consistent with the fact that lesions in the NEGR1 gene reveal a unique role for this protein in mediating obesity in humans.

There, NEGR1 likely remodels the synaptic connections in neural circuits that underlying feeding. Because NEGR1 undergoes ectodomain shedding in vivo (releasing its extracellular domain from the cell surface), our results suggest that NEGR1 may have long range impacts in remodeling neural circuits as well.

One relatively larger study noted associations between OCS and altered gray and white matter volume in healthy children (Su\u00f1ol et a., 2018).

Of these children, n = 10,585 successfully completed T1 structural imaging that were analyzed using FreeSurfer and that passed ABCD quality control procedures. Resting state data was also collected and analyzed with the ABCD pipelines; n = 8,341 children had >5 minutes of data retained after quality control.

A growing body of evidence from diverse conditions implicates disturbance of frontoparietal function in insight impairment. In DSM-V, obsessive compulsive and related disorders are specified by level of insight. However, in hoarding disorder (HD), the degree to which affected individuals manifest insight impairment is controversial, and accurate assessment is confounded by reliance on self-report measures. In this study, we explored whether individuals with HD underreport their clutter, and whether the degree of underreporting correlates with demographic, clinical, or neurocognitive behavioral measures. Methods: Data were obtained from n = 68 individuals (average age 57.2 (range 24-75), 76% female) who screened voluntarily for participation in a study of HD. Individuals underwent clinical diagnostic interviews and self-and clinician-rated assessments including the Clutter Image Rating (CIR; an established pictorial rating scale of clutter), Saving Inventory-Revised (SI-R), Saving Cognitions Inventory (SCI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HDRS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS). A home visit followed (average interval 25 days, range 0 to 100) during which a trained, independent evaluator completed the CIR. Self-rated (SR-) and independent evaluator (IE-) CIR scores for dually-scored individual rooms were averaged for each subject. SR-and IE-CIR ratings were compared via a two-tailed paired t test. A CIR 'error' score (CIR-error) was generated by subtracting the SR-CIR average from the IE-CIR average and dividing the difference by the IE-CIR average. CIRerror was used as a dependent variable for linear regression using clinical and demographic variables as predictors. A subset of participants (n = 42, average age 57, 81% female) completed a validated computer-administered battery of neurocognitive tests (Brain Resource WebNeuro). The relationship between CIR-error scores and reference-population normalized scores for performance on individual neurocognitive measures was similarly modeled using linear regression.",

However, few such tDCS studies have been done, particularly in using neuroimaging measures of brain function before and after stimulation. Here, we tested whether a course of tDCS had effects on brain circuitry plausibly implicated in OCD using fMRI restingstate functional connectivity (RSFC). Methods: Methods: Twelve OCD participants and 16 healthy controls (HC) were included in the final analysis. Participants underwent open-label 1.5mA cathodal tDCS to the pSMA for one week, 2 sessions per day. All underwent MRI scans within one week prior to tDCS initiation, and 3-4 days after the last tDCS session. tDCS sessions were 20 minutes in duration, with one hour between each tDCS session. We placed a 5 x 5cm cathodal electrode at FCz, and a 5 x 7cm anode on the right cheek. Followup clinical interviews were carried out with the OCD group at 1 month and 4 months post-stimulation. Basic MRI preprocessing, functional connectivity preprocessing, and first-level connectivity models were carried out using the CONN Toolbox. A priori regions of interest (ROIs) or \"seeds\" for functional connectivity were based on coordinates reported in prior OCD studies, or on an exploratory multivariate pattern analysis. Analyses included group-level seedto-voxel analyses between groups (HC v OCD) as well as post-tDCS clinical change. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the uncorrected voxel threshold of p < .005 and the false discovery rate-corrected cluster threshold of p < .05.

Thus, treatments that have anti-inflammatory properties but also possess dopamine modulation may prove to be beneficial in treating people with schizophrenia.

Data related to the discontinuation of RBP-7000 (eg, discontinuation rates, number of injections) were calculated for those who previously received risperidone and those who received other antipsychotics (ie, nonrisperidone).

Demographic variables were essentially similar between both the risperidone and non-risperidone groups. One hundred ninety-eight (49%) patients completed the open-label study. The primary reason for discontinuation in the total population was withdrawal of consent (83 [20%]), followed by adverse events (46 [11%] ) and lost to follow-up (39 [10%]). Discontinuation rates were numerically lower among patients who previously received risperidone prior to RBP-7000 (62 [48%]) than those who received other antipsychotics (129 [56%]). Similarly, the risperidone group had a higher median/mean number of injections during the treatment phase (13/9) compared to the non-risperidone group (9/8). A numerically larger number of patients who initially received antipsychotics other than risperidone discontinued RBP-7000 due to adverse events (31 [13%]) compared to those initially treated with risperidone (11 [9%]). Discontinuation rates for adverse events related to study treatment were 18 (8%) for the non-risperidone group and 6 (5%) for the risperidone group.

                "text": "Keywords Background: Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) are used to treat highly prevalent psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, making them among the most widely prescribed psychiatric medications today. However, these drugs also cause profound metabolic disturbances including weight gain, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance and increase the risks of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. Significantly, all APDs cause metabolic side effects to differing degrees and current treatments to reduce these metabolic symptoms have only limited efficacy. To date, the mechanisms for APD-induced metabolic disturbances are poorly understood. Nonetheless, the single unifying property of all APDs is their blockade of dopamine (DA) D2-like receptors including D2 (D2R) and D3 (D3R) receptors, suggesting a potential role for these receptors in APDinduced metabolic dysfunction. Importantly, APD-induced changes in glucose homeostasis occur even in the absence of increased food intake, or psychiatric disease. Indeed, as little as a single administration of olanzapine is sufficient to alter glucose homeostasis independent of weight changes in healthy human subjects. This raises the possibility that APDs may act directly on metabolically-relevant peripheral targets to cause metabolic disturbances. Consistent with this, we and others discovered that D2R and D3R are expressed peripherally in both human and rodent insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells, key regulators of glucose metabolism. While considerably less studied then beta cells, there is also evidence that D2R and D3R are expressed in glucagon-secreting pancreatic alpha cells. We therefore hypothesize that APD-induced metabolic disturbances are driven by the direct actions of APDs on pancreatic alpha cell and beta cell D2-like receptors. Methods: Human pancreatic islet transcriptome analysis: Deidentified human islet alpha cells and beta cells (n = 5: 3 females, 2 males) were purified by FACS sorting; alpha cells and beta cells were distinguished via indirect antibody labeling with alpha-and beta cell markers (Brissova et al., 2018) .",

This approach eliminates all washing steps, making our assays rapid and high-throughput. We first examined the roles of DA signaling on glucagon release from human pancreatic islets, discovering that low DA concentrations potently decreased glucagon release, in addition to DA's inhibition of beta cell glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). These data suggest that DA modulates both glucagon and insulin secretion in islets. We next examined whether APDs disrupt coordinated secretion of glucagon and insulin during glucose stimulation of human islets. We showed that both clozapine and olanzapine substantially increased alpha cell glucagon secretion relative to vehicle controls; haloperidol also raised glucagon secretion, albeit to a lesser degree compared to olanzapine and clozapine. All three APDs also significantly increased GSIS from the same islets. Our results suggest that APDs enhance insulin and glucagon release, contributing to systemic metabolic dysfunction.",

However, both efficacy and safety remain a concern for many patients. Clinical response to AP treatment for schizophrenia with these dopaminergic agents is often characterized by limited control of psychotic symptoms, leading to poor functioning, polypharmacy, and relapse. There is a strong unmet need for treatment that will improve overall outcomes and can safely be given adjunctively to current APs. Pimavanserin (PIM), a non-dopaminergic inverse agonist/antagonist of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors, and to a lesser extent 5-HT2C receptors, has been approved for treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis and is now under investigation for treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with several other psychiatric conditions as well as for treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.

                "text": "Keywords Background: Neuroimaging and graph analyses suggests an aberrant organization of the whole-brain functional connectome in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). There are two principles of network organization: segregation (i.e., the local organization of the brain in functionally specialized units) and integration (i.e., short pathways between every brain region). A balance of the two is associated with more effective neuronal processing. Segregation can be measured using the clustering coefficient and integration using characteristic path length and global efficiency. Importantly, network segregation and integration change from resting to task states in healthy participants (HC). Studies using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in SZ showed a reduced network segregation compared to HC, while integration seemed to be largely preserved. Studies using task fMRI showed no differences between SZ and HC. However, in SZ and BD studies it is very rare to examine changes in segregation and integration at rest versus during a task on the same participants in the same session. Therefore, the questions arise as to whether the organization of the functional connectome adapts to task demands in severe mental illness and whether the extent of change from resting to task states is impaired in patients compared to HC. The current fMRI study addressed these questions in a reasonably large sample of patients with SZ and BD as well as HC participants. Methods: 44 individuals with SZ, 44 with BD, and 43 HC participants were eligible for analysis. Diagnoses were confirmed with the SCID-I. Participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. Task (400 s) and resting state fMRI (300 s) were acquired on a Siemens Tim Trio 3 T MRI scanner using a T2*weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) gradient-echo pulse sequence (TR 2500 ms; TE 35 ms; voxel size 3x3x3.3 mm). fMRI data (pre-) processing was performed in FSL in accordance with current standards. Nuisance regression was performed (6 motion regressors, cerebrospinal fluid and white matter signal, one regressor for each TR with a relative FD > 0.5 mm). Task related activity was additionally regressed out. The residual NIfTIs were used to extract mean time series for each node (anatomical Destrieux atlas; functional Power atlas). Nodes that were not covered in the fMRI scans were excluded [N(anat) = 26; N(func) = 60]. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were computed for each pair of nodes. Negative r's were set to 0. Participants with > 50 % negative r's were excluded (N = 1). Connectivity matrices were Fisher-ztransformed. Graph analyses were performed using the R package 'brainGraph'. Clustering coefficient ('Cp'), characteristic path length ('Lp') and global efficiency ('E.global') were calculated across a range of density thresholds (0.1 to 0.5, steps of 0.02). The area under the curve (AUC) across densities was computed for each graph index, participant and condition (task vs. rest). For statistical analysis, mixed-design analysis of variance was performed with the between-subject factor group (SZ vs. BD vs. HC) and the within-subject factor condition.",

The precise etiology of SCZ and co-occurring alcohol use disorder is unclear, but it is theorized that early life stressors combined with adolescent drug exposure may lead to exacerbated symptoms, including increased substance use. In clinical samples, prenatal exposure to infection is a significant risk factor for SCZ, and can be modeled in rodents using maternal immune activation (MIA). MIA offspring demonstrate multiple behavioral and neurobiological phenotypes reflective of neuropsychiatric illness, but the ability of MIA to induce increased alcohol drinking has not been investigated. Furthermore, it is unknown whether a \"second-hit\" in adolescence (such as exposure to alcohol) is necessary to increase alcohol drinking in adulthood, as well as what the neurobiological consequences of one-vs. two-hits are in this model. The current experiment therefore aimed to investigate the impact of MIA, adolescent alcohol exposure (AE), and MIA + AE combined (DUAL) on adulthood drinking behavior and local field potential (LFP) oscillations recorded from the striatum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus (regions heavily involved in SCZ and alcohol reward).",

Poly(I:C) is a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, which leads to a heightened immune response in rats. Both male and female pups were allowed to develop normally and weaned on post-natal day (P) 21. Half of the rats were allowed to drink 10% alcohol in their home cage from P28-42 (24 hr access). On P70, one group of rats were again given access to alcohol in their home cage for 90 min/ day, 5 days/week (n = 18-20/group) for 3 weeks in order to measure adulthood alcohol consumption. The other group of rats were implanted with electrodes targeting the bilateral nucleus accumbens shell (NacSh), infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) medial prefrontal cortex, and the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Following recovery, LFPs were recorded from each awake, freelybehaving rat (n = 8-18/group) during two 30-minute sessions. Data from each recording were analyzed using established frequency ranges (delta =1-4 Hz, theta = 5-10 Hz, alpha = 11-14 Hz, beta = 15-30 Hz, low gamma = 45-65 Hz, and high gamma = 70-90 Hz) from the rodent literature. Standard LFP signal processing to characterize the power spectral densities within, and coherence between brain regions for each rat was calculated using custom code written for Matlab. Using the machine-learning algorithm lasso, we built predictive models to classify rats based on group assignment, (e.g., Control, MIA, AE, or DUAL) . We compared the model performance from real data to the performance of models built and tested on data permutations (which estimates chance). If the lasso indicated that information existed in the LFP signal, we implemented exhaustive single feature regressions using each LFP predictor to determine the relative information content of each neural feature.",

Background: Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs), click trainsevoked EEG oscillations at 40-Hz in the temporal cortex, are known to be compromised in patients with schizophrenia, which may be associated with their cognitive dysfunction. ASSRs are also severely impaired in our schizophrenia mouse model in which NMDA receptor subunit GluN1 is deleted in~50% of cortical and hippocampal GABA neurons in early postnatal development (Ppp1r2cre/GluN1 knockout (KO) mice; Belforte et al, 2010; Nakao and Nakazawa, 2014). Furthermore, we recently found that immunoreactivity (IR) against a phosphorylated form of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3; at Y216 in GSK3\u03b2), which is an autoactivated form of GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2, is augmented in the PV neurons (presumably GluN1-deleted), but not pyramidal neurons of the mutant mPFC. To assess the impact of predictive GSK3\u03b2 overactivity on the in vivo action potential (AP) spike synchrony of cortical pyramidal neurons and in vivo tone-evoked LFP gamma oscillation, and cognitive behavior, we took a pharmacological and genetic approach. Methods: ANIMAL Ppp1r2-cre( + /\u2212)/fGluN1(f/f) KO mice were generated as previously described (Belforte et al.,2010) , and were tested with various GSK3 inhibitors under two in vivo electrophysiology tests (Cross-correlation and ASSR) and two behavioral tests [spontaneous alternation in Y-maze and prepulse inhibition (PPI)]. To achieve GSK3\u03b1-or GSK3\u03b2-specific genetic inhibition in G-luN1-deleted GABA neurons, either floxed-GSK3\u03b1 or floxed-GSK3\u03b2 mouse strain was bred to Ppp1r2cre/GluN1 KO mice to generate the GABA neuron-selective GSK3 heterozygous KO mice. In those triple transgenic mutant mice, the kinase activity could be normalized in the GluN1-deleted PV neurons. IN VIVO MULTIUNIT RECORDING. Animals (both sex, 10-15 weeks old) implanted with a microarray carrying 6 tetrodes on the somatosensory cortex were subjected to a linear track to record the unit activity from somatosensory cortex. To analyze the level of synchronization of local excitatory circuits, after cell-clustering to isolate the pyramidal neurons, pairs of cells recorded in the same tetrode were subjected to cross-correlation analysis. IN VIVO LFP RECORDING. LFP recording was performed from A1 cortex of awake, head-restrained mice in an auditory isolation chamber (background sound level, 35 dB SPL). 500-ms long click trains consisting of 80 dB white-noise pulses presented at 40Hz (40-Hz ASSR stimuli) were applied 50 times with an inter-stimulus interval of sec. BEHAVIORAL TEST: A different cohort of animals were subjected to Y-maze spontaneous alternation test (for assessment of spatial working memory) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle reflex as described previously.",

To determine which isoform of GSK3, GSK3\u03b1 or GSK3\u03b2, elicits the impairment via over-activity in the PV neurons, we used the GSK3\u03b2-paralog selective inhibitor, BRD3731 (30 mg/kg, IP) and GSK3\u03b1-paralog selective inhibitor, BRD0705 (30 mg/kg, IP). Administration of BRD3731, but not BRD0705, alleviated the defective gamma oscillation in the GluN1 mutant mice (9 channels before and after BRD3731, p = 0.006; 6 channels before and after BRD0705, p = 0.34, paired t-test). To address the role of GSK3\u03b2-specific inhibition in GABA neurons, we bred a floxed-GSK3\u03b2 mouse strain to the Ppp1r2cre/GluN1 KO mice to generate the GABA neuron-selective GSK3\u03b2 heterozygous knockout (GABA neuron-selective knockdown). Genetic GSK3\u03b2 knockdown reverses in vivo AP spike synchrony deficits (31 neuron-pairs from GSK3\u03b2 knockdown mice vs 24 pairs from the original KO mutants, p = 0.0013, t-test), but GSK3\u03b1 knockdown did not reverse the deficits (10 pairs from GSK3\u03b1 knockdown mice vs 24 pairs from KO mutants, p = 0.99, t-test). Genetic GSK3\u03b2 knockdown mice also alleviated the defective gamma oscillation (7 channels for GSK3\u03b2 knockdown vs 13 channels for original mutants, p = 0.02, t-test). We assessed whether GSK3 inhibition restored the cognitive function in the GluN1 mutant mice. TDZD-8 restored the spontaneous alternation in spatial Y-maze (n = 6 for TDZD8 vs n = 8 for saline, p < 0.05, t-test) and PPI of the GluN1 mutant mice (n = 12 for TDZD8 vs n = 20 for saline, p < 0.05, twoway ANOVA post hoc test).

The following study aimed to extend these findings in a cohort of individuals with more chronic illness. Methods: All data were obtained from a publicly available Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) dataset (http:// fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/cobre.html), which included resting-state fMRI and structural scans obtained on a 3T scanner, and an array of clinical and neuropsychological measures. Individuals with SZ (N = 61, 14F, mean age = 38 years) and matched healthy controls (N = 73, 23F, mean age = 36 years) were examined in this analysis. Patients were divided into high-or low-functioning groups based on scores across measures of psychopathology and cognition. Seed regions of interest in bilateral GP interna and externa were drawn based on anatomical location. Resting-state connectivity was examined between these seeds and regions of the salience network (including the dorsal anterior cingulate, and left and right insula) that were significant in our previous study (Tarcijonas et al., 2019) .

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockers such as ketamine induce psychotic symptoms in healthy humans (Krystal et al., 1994) . Schizophrenia is associated with a reduction in parvalbumin (PV) expressing GABAergic interneurons, which are regulated by NMDAR, in the cortex and hippocampus (Benes et al., 1991 , Zhang et al., 2002 . It has been suggested that impaired PV neuronal function may lead to disinhibition of mesostriatal dopamine neuron activity (Grace 2016). However, the circuit mechanisms underlying increased dopamine synthesis capacity and how it is regulated by changes in PV neurons, is unknown. Therefore, we tested the effect of the sub-chronic ketamine on dopamine synthesis capacity using the same [18F]-FDOPA PET imaging approach which has shown elevated dopamine synthesis capacity in patients, and investigated the underlying circuitry. Methods: All procedures were conducted under license in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Male mice received sub-chronic administration of 30mg/kg ketamine or saline. They underwent a dynamic [18F]-FDOPA PET scan to measure striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. PV interneurons in PLc and ventral subiculum (VSub) of the hippocampus in PV::Cre mice were transduced with Credependent hM3Dq-mCherry designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). Mice received clozapine Noxide (CNO) or saline before the administration of ketamine and they underwent a PET scan. Data were analysed by two-tailed independent samples t-tests or two-way ANOVAs. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

This strategy of deeply sequencing target cell populations provides a powerful balance between unbiased single cell and homogenate tissue sequencing that can provide cell type-specific associations to common molecular and clinical traits. Background: Auditory information is briefly stored in a passive sensory buffer (echoic memory) for comparison with subsequent sounds. It has been suggested that impaired encoding into echoic memory lies at the heart of auditory deficits in individuals with schizophrenia. However, because the neural substrate of echoic memory is unclear, it limits our ability to ameliorate auditory deficits in schizophrenia. Given the sensory nature of echoic memory, it is commonly assumed to reside in early sensory regions such as primary auditory cortex (A1). This is consistent with the prominent pathological changes that point to an involvement of Heschl's Gyrus in auditory deficits in schizophrenia. A mechanistic understanding of the neural substrate of echoic memory necessarily depends on granular measures of neural activity in an appropriate animal model. Macaque monkeys have been shown to exhibit a passive, pre-categorical and short-lived component of auditory short-term memory that most likely corresponds to human echoic memory. So far, however, singlecell recordings in the macaque have not been able to establish a firm link between echoic memory and A1. To provide a functional link between echoic memory and A1, we tested if echoic memory in the macaque is affected by the same stimulus properties that are known to affect neural responses in A1. In particular, we tested if echoic memory is affected by tone intensity which increases response amplitudes and widens receptive fields in A1, or if it is insensitive to tone duration which has only minor effects on the mostly phasic responses in A1. Methods: To better understand the potential involvement of A1 in echoic memory, two macaque monkeys were trained to release a lever if and when a series of identical pure tone pips was interrupted by a deviant pip of different tonal frequency. Across different trials, the pips were presented at one of 5 intensities (40, 50, 60, 70 or 80dB SPL) and one of six durations (25, 50, 75, 100, 150, or 200 ms) . Inter-stimulus intervals were kept between 500 and 1000 ms, a range in which task performance was shown to depend mostly on information in echoic memory. EEG responses were recorded from arrays of up to 32 chronically implanted cranial EEG electrodes. Echoic memory function was quantified as the slope of the psychometric function relating the frequency-difference between standard and target tone to lever release probability.",

In contrast, echoic memory improved significantly and substantially for longer tone durations. The improvement was approximately linear across the presented durations. Follow-up experiments suggested that the effect was driven by more accurate encoding of information into echoic memory rather than prolonged maintenance. The effect of tone intensity and duration on neural responses was quantified via auditory evoked EEG potentials. As expected, EEG potentials increased with intensity. In contrast, only one EEG component (the N1 homolog) of one animal was modulated by tone duration. All other EEG components, including the ones believed to originate in A1, were insensitive to tone duration.

It remains to be tested how this intensity-invariance is implemented at the neural level. (2) Encoding of information into echoic memory improves with tone duration suggesting a temporal integration window above 200 ms. It remains to be tested if and how temporal integration is related to the relatively small fraction of neurons in A1 that exhibit sustained responses to their preferred stimulus, and how information contained in sustained firing is integrated over time. We will discuss short-term presynaptic depression as one candidate mechanism of echoic memory that can account for temporal integration of stimulus information.",

Background: Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) share some genetic and environmental risk factors, as well as certain clinical features. These shared factors and features in SZ and BP may be linked via similar functional, morphological and brain alterations, many of which have been associated with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. The primary role of mitochondria is the synthesis of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondria also participate in other biological processes integral to neuronal functioning, including mediating oxidative stress, Ca2 + buffering and apoptosis. Although mitochondrial perturbations have been reported in both SZ and BP, the severity of these alterations and/or the affected mitochondrial functions might differ between diagnoses, especially at the level of individual cell types. For example, a cell type-specific transcriptomic profiling study directly comparing SZ and BP subjects found significant OXPHOS-related alterations in PFC pyramidal neurons (PNs) collected from layer 3 (L3PNs) and layer 5 (L5PNs) in SZ subjects but not in BP subjects.

Postmortem and in vivo imaging studies have shown decreases in M1/ M4 muscarinic receptors in patients with schizophrenia. These decreases may in part be associated with the cognitive deficits observed in patients with schizophrenia and supported by the preliminary pro-cognitive effects of the M1/M4 agonist Xanomeline. However, the relationship between cholinergic neuronal integrity and the sensitivity to M1 receptor modulation is unknown. The BF volume may be an important biomarker of cholinergic neuronal integrity and could potentially modify functional response to cholinergic drugs including M1 and/or M4 agonists. The objective of this study was to examine the profile of cognitive impairment associated with M1 receptor antagonism by biperiden in healthy volunteers and medication free patients diagnose with a psychotic disorder and determine whether BF volumes predict cognitive sensitivity to biperiden. A secondary objective was to determine whether BF cholinergic cell groups such as the CH4 (i.e. nucleus basalis) volume predicts biperiden effect on cortically mediated cognitive domains, and whether CH1-3 (septal/diagonal band of Broca) volumes predict biperiden effects on hippocampal mediated episodic memory. Methods: A total of 30 control subjects and 29 medication free patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder were included in the study. BFN volumes were quantified from T1 weighted 3TMRI scans. The stereotactic basal forebrain atlas was used to derive masks to quantify the nucleus basalis (CH4) and the septal nucleus (CH1), vertical (CH2), and horizontal limb (CH3). Cognition was assessed twice for all subjects using the Cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery. A randomized, placebo controlled, counterbalanced design was used in which all participants received placebo or 4 mg of M1 antagonist biperiden with a minimal washout period of 7 days. This clinical trial was registered in the Dutch clinical trial registry under ID: NTR5094 (http://www.trialregister.nl).",

Background: Evidence of GABA neuron dysfunction is a common finding in postmortem studies of certain psychiatric illnesses. Although they utilize similar gene products for neurotransmission, subtypes of GABA neurons are distinguished based on the expression of different molecular markers. Transcript levels of many of these gene products are known to differ between prefrontal (PFC) and primary visual (V1) cortices, but whether the laminar patterns of expression are conserved or different between these regions is not known. Moreover, it is not known whether these expression patterns are due to differences in the density of GABA neurons expressing these markers or in the level of expression per neuron. In this study, we examined the expression of multiple GABA-related transcripts in cortical layers 2 and 4, which are enriched for different classes of GABA neurons, of the macaque monkey PFC and V1. Methods: Layers 2 and 4 were captured by laser microdissection in sections taken from fresh-frozen blocks of PFC and V1 from 15 rhesus macaques (11 male/4 female, 41-101 months of age). All animals were experimentally na\u00efve except for serving as vehicle-exposed animals in separate studies investigating the impact of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol on cognitive task performance. PCR was used to quantify levels of transcripts that are 1) involved in GABA neurotransmission: GABA synthesizing enzymes (GAD67 and GAD65), vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT), and GABA reuptake transporter (GAT1); 2) present in different GABA neuron subtypes: calretinin (CR), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calbindin (CB), somatostatin (SST), cholecystokinin (CCK), cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R), and parvalbumin (PV); and 3) encode key GABAA receptor subunits: GABRA1 and GABRA2. In a subset of these animals (n = 6, 3 male/3 female,~60 months of age), RNAscope was used to label GAD67, PV, and SST mRNAs in the same tissue sections. The density of GAD67, PV, and SST neurons and the levels of each transcript per neuron were quantified in layers 2 and 4 of PFC and V1.

SST and PV showed highly consistent rank-order patterns for each animal studied, whereas GAD67 exhibited no clear withinanimal rank order patterns. To address whether these patterns were due to differences in the relative densities of these GABA neuron subtypes or in the expression of each transcript per neuron, we used triple label RNAscope for GAD67, SST, and PV in a subset of 6 animals.

In contrast, markers of unique GABA neuron subtypes show regional differences in expression levels and similar laminar patterns within a region. These findings suggest that the circuit organization of GABA neuron subtypes is conserved across regions but that the relative weighting of each type of GABA neuron within a circuit differs by region, differences with potential consequences for circuit function. For example, the high expression of PV in V1 may provide the fast-synaptic inhibition onto pyramidal neurons needed to tune neural ensembles to specific visual stimuli, whereas the high expression of SST in PFC may reflect the need for greater inhibition onto dendrites, secondary to the more complex dendritic arbor of pyramidal neurons in this region. Together, these findings suggest that cortical circuits may be differentially vulnerable to disease effects based on the constitutive GABA neuron subtypes in that region. This differential vulnerability may contribute to the diversity and severity of clinical symptoms observed in psychiatric illnesses.",

Nonetheless, there is also some evidence that at least in the acute phase of treatment in schizophrenia, beneficial outcome associates with increasing weight or BMI. The results in long-term schizophrenia are controversial. We tested the hypothesis that high BMI associates with poor functioning status in a sample of long-term outpatients with schizophrenia. Methods: We analyse the weight, height and psychosocial functioning (Functioning Assessment Short Test, FAST) of two hundred ninety four individuals for a clinical interview, consisting in 193 patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 102 individuals with no personal or family history of severe mental illness as a control group (CTR) .

Interestingly, THC serum levels were numerically higher in CBD-THC (19.08 \u00b1 5.386 pmol/ml) than in the THC-PLA (13.85 \u00b1 4.095 pmol/ml). The linear mixed model used to predict the effects of both compounds on psychotic symptoms yielded a partial extinction of the THC effect by CBD when CBD serum levels were altered by the factor 2 and 3 and a complete elimination with four times higher serum levels of CBD.",

However, little is known about how to identify youth within the heterogeneous category of ASD who are at risk of developing psychosis. It is also unclear to what extent the neurocognitive correlates of psychosis, such as impairments in executive function, processing speed, and working memory, differ in the ASD population relative to the non-ASD population. We explored these questions, with a focus on the relationship between existing ASD diagnosis and emerging prodromal psychosis in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) sample. We hypothesized that: ASD would be a predictor of prodromal psychotic symptoms in our sample (1), and that neuropsychological profiles would differ among ASD youth without prodromal symptoms, ASD youth with prodromal symptoms, and youth with prodromal symptoms but not ASD (2). Methods: We examined a sample (n = 11,875) of youth (47.84% female; age M = 9.91 years, SD = 0.62 years) from the ABCD study (data release 2.0.1). We identified youth whose parents reported an ASD diagnosis during study screening, and examined prodromal symptoms using Prodromal Questionnaire -Brief Child Version (PQ-BCV) scores. We defined \"potentially significant\" symptoms using a PQ-BCV total score cutoff of 6, based on previous literature. We also examined neuropsychological profiles using three NIH Toolbox measures selected in advance to capture core neuropsychological deficits associated with ASD and/or psychosis: Dimensional Change Card Sort (a measure of executive function), Pattern Comparison (a measure of processing speed), and List Sorting (a measure of working memory). To assess ASD diagnosis as a predictor of prodromal symptoms, we estimated a hierarchical linear regression model with family unit and study site as nested random effects and age, sex, ethnicity, and household per capita income as covariates. We excluded 1,262 participants from this model due to missing data. We used one-way analysis of variance to compare mean age-corrected scores along these measures across ASD youth without prodromal symptoms, ASD youth with prodromal symptoms, and prodromal youth without ASD.

Based on its localization and functional coupling, GPR52 may play a role in the modulation of fronto-striatal and limbic dopamine in neuropsychiatric disorders. GPR52 agonists are thought to be particularly relevant to the treatment of psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, where they are hypothesized to improve cognition and negative symptoms indirectly by potentiating D1 signalling, but alleviate positive symptoms through inhibition of D2-mediated signalling in the striatum. Biodistribution studies of GPR52 mRNA in mice suggest that the receptor may also be co-localised with cholinergic and glutamatergic systems. GPR52's potential role in the modulation of cholinergic and glutamatergic signalling has not been fully explored to date but is also highly relevant to the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Currently, no effective therapeutic strategies exist to treat cognitive and negative symptoms in neuropsychiatric disorders, and existing atypical antipsychotics are associated with adverse effects. Given the important implications of early published findings, the current study sought firstly to replicate initial studies performed with the GPR52 agonist, 4-(3-(3fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl)-5-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-2methylbenzamide (FTBMT), where positive effects were noted in mouse psychostimulant-induced hyperlocomotion assays.

Background: Kalirin (KAL) is a Rho GEF that is highly involved in regulation of cytoskeletal morphology within dendrites. Nogo receptor (NGR) signaling acts to restrict dendritic growth when it complexes with p75, a process which involves activation of RhoA. The KAL9 isoform is a dual GEF, capable of activating both Rac1 or RhoA. We evaluated a naturally occurring missense mutation in KALRN (KALRN-PT), located near the RhoA GEF in KAL9, and found that it acts as a gain of function mutation for RhoA activation. We hypothesized that KAL9 sits downstream of NGR/p75, and that the enhanced RhoA activity in KALRN-PT leads to increased NGR/ p75 signaling, thus impairing dendritic morphogenesis in pyramidal cells (PCs) across development.",

The effect observed in the present study would be equivalent to a 2-unit increase in BMI. These results suggest that there is an adiposity-independent, acuteonset effect of both tested antipsychotic drugs on glucose regulation at the level of skeletal muscle.

Linkage analysis in clusters of pedigrees sharing a DSM diagnoses or phenotype have largely not replicated. Transcriptome and genome wide association studies using many tens-of-thousands of cases have successfully led to hundreds of risk loci; however, the significant loci have low effect size. Perhaps no risk genes with large effect size are causal in psychiatric genetics, i.e., all are highly polygenic. Yet, it is puzzling why all other branches of medicine have found many Mendelian genes associated with disease. In fact, early discovery of such genes played pivotal roles in the initial understanding of the pathophysiology of many common disorders (e.g., dyslipidemia, thalassemia, and other inborn errors of metabolism). Another interpretation is the heterogeneity of psychiatric disorders precludes finding rare Mendelian genes when many distinct diseases under a DSM rubric are lumped together at a syndromal level. Recently, linkage analyses of single consanguineous pedigrees afflicted by a variety of disorders are finding rare variants with large effect sizes associated with disorders providing candidate genes for further study (Rilstone et al., NEJM 2013; Alkuraya et al., 2010) However, because these genes are so rare, causal evidence requires convergent approaches such as molecular dissection within cellular pathways and interactome, 3D modeling, animal models, and directed therapeutics. Methods: Human Subjects: A Pakistani consanguineous pedigree consisted of two healthy parents who were first cousins and seven offspring. One child died early. Two girls had psychosis with auditory hallucinations and delusions consistent with DSM schizophrenia with onset at ages~15 and 23 years. The older girl had the more severe affliction. These girls had no history of substance abuse, major affective illness, or intellectual disability. The other children were psychiatrically well. All provided informed consent. The MINI was used as a screener. Blood was collected and processed for DNA sequencing.",

Background: Serotonin (5-HT) type 2A receptors (5-HT2AR) modulate mood and perception and are the principal molecular targets for psychedelic hallucinogens and atypical antipsychotic medications. The 5-HT2AR canonically activates heterotrimeric Gq G-proteins which, in turn, activate phospholipase C and formation of inositol phosphates to stimulate the intracellular release of calcium. The 5-HT2AR may also interact with \u03b2-arrestin proteins; however, the importance of \u03b2-arrestins in the action of hallucinogens or for 5-HT2AR signaling are largely undefined. Here we use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to stably knockout (KO) \u03b2-arrestins in cells to study \u03b2-arrestin contributions to 5-HT2AR agonist signaling and receptor trafficking. Methods: Wildtype (WT) HEK293 parental cells or cells lines in which \u03b2-arrestin 1 and 2 were stably knocked out using CRISPR/ Cas9 genome editing were generated, validated and used for these studies. WT and KO cells were transfected with human 5-HT2AR and receptor signaling and trafficking in response to agonists was assessed using a combination of receptor imaging by confocal microscopy, live cell calcium fluorescence imaging, cell surface ELISA assay and western blotting for ERK phosphorylation.

Live cell confocal imaging of HA-5-HT2AR determined rapid endocytosis of receptors within 3 mins of agonist stimulation. To determine if \u03b2-arrestins control this rapid receptor endocytosis to impact signaling, we used HEK293 cells lacking both isoforms of \u03b2arrestins. Using a receptor cell surface ELISA, we confirmed 5 min agonist treatment with 5-HT or DOI resulted in rapid (~50%) loss of receptors from the cell surface in parent cells; however, endocytosis was significantly reduced in \u03b2-arrestin 1/2 KO cells. Measuring kinetic live cell calcium release using the FLIPR assay and dose responses of selective 5-HT2AR agonists, we determined prolonged duration of calcium release in \u03b2-arrestin 1/2 KO cells. The maximal 5-HT2AR calcium signaling was significantly elevated by 45% (5-HT) and 46 % (DOI) in KO cells vs. WT parent cells; however, agonist potency was unchanged. Re-expression of \u03b2arrestin 1 or 2 in KO cells reduced the elevated 5-HT2AR calcium responses to that of parent cells and \u03b2-arrestin KO did not affect other Gq-coupled GPCRs (5-HT2CR, P2YR), indicating 5-HT2AR specific effects from genetic knockout of \u03b2-arrestins.

Background: Schizophrenia is generally associated with deficits in the power and phase synchronization of stimulus-evoked gammaband (30-100 Hz) oscillations in the electro-and magnetoencephalogram (EEG/MEG). The gamma oscillation deficit that has been the most widely replicated is of the 40 Hz auditory steadystate response (ASSR), which has been found to be reduced compared to healthy individuals in the chronic and first episode states. These deficits indicate that gamma-generating neural circuitry in the auditory system is dysfunctional in schizophrenia. Recent studies have also suggested that spontaneous broadband gamma (30-100 Hz) activity in the auditory cortex is increased in chronic schizophrenia. Both the 40 Hz ASSR deficit and increased spontaneous gamma \"noise\" in schizophrenia have been attributed to abnormal inhibitory interneuron function, possibly as a consequence of NMDA receptor hypofunction. However, it is unknown whether increased spontaneous gamma is present in the first episode state, and if so, whether this abnormality and the 40 Hz ASSR deficit progress over time. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether 1) spontaneous gamma activity in the auditory cortex is increased in first-episode schizophrenia, and 2) the spontaneous gamma and 40 Hz ASSR abnormalities change over a 1 year interval after the first hospitalization for psychosis. Methods: Participants were 23 individuals with first-episode schizophrenia (FESZ) and 39 healthy comparison individuals (HC), assessed at two time points (Time 1 and Time 2) one year apart on average. The FESZ and HC groups were matched on gender proportion and age. Participants were presented with 500 ms click trains at 20, 30, and 40 Hz stimulation frequencies while the EEG was recorded with a dense electrode array. EEG artifacts were removed with independent component analysis. Dipole source analysis was used to localize the ASSR to bilateral auditory cortices and to construct a spatial filter for auditory cortex activity, from which spontaneous gamma and the ASSR were derived. Spontaneous gamma activity was computed with the Fast Fourier Transform as the induced gamma power in the baseline (-500 to 0 ms) and ASSR (30-530 ms) periods. ASSR phase locking factor (PLF) and evoked power were computed with the Morlet wavelet transform.",

Thus, this gamma abnormality appears to be present early in the course of schizophrenia, although the size of the effect did not change over the 1-year assessment interval. In contrast, the 40 Hz ASSR PLF deficit in first-episode schizophrenia did become worse over 1 year. The differential progression of increased spontaneous gamma activity and the 40 Hz ASSR PLF deficit suggest that the underlying neural substrates of these effects differ to some degree. These findings add to our understanding of the auditory cortex abnormalities that occur in schizophrenia and point to additional directions to explore in elucidating the neural circuit disturbances that underlie this disorder.",

Background: Cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenic patients emerges earlier than other symptoms, and persists throughout the duration of illness. While most anti-psychotic drugs are effective at treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, the negative and cognitive symptoms are poorly managed by clinically available therapies. Interestingly, pharmacological activation of kappa opioid receptors (KORs) in humans produces visual and auditory hallucinations similar to positive symptoms in schizophrenia, and chronic activation of dynorphin systems (endogenous KOR ligands) in mice can lead to affective changes similar to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (anhedonia and depression). These observations suggest that endogenous dynorphin activity may be dysregulated in some persons with schizophrenia, but whether selective KOR antagonists could ameliorate cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia has not been adequately explored in pre-clinical studies.",

One of these essential processes is the ability of neurons to constantly modify their structure in response to neurotransmitters and other molecules in order to establish functional connections. A neurotransmitter that has consistently been associated with schizophrenia is dopamine but its exact role as a potential etiological factor remains to be determined.

Thus, FHR youths are developing broad spectrum psychiatric symptoms in other areas that is worthy of clinical attention suggesting that familial risk for psychosis may exert pleiotropic effect on manifest psychopathology. FHR scored low on mania with no difference in depression suggesting decreased drive and motivation. The DSM CCM domains correspond to the RDoC framework in several areas of the matrix. Association of longitudinal changes in inattention and anxiety scores with prefrontal and limbic regions suggests potential role of these regions in the evolution of broad psychosis spectrum psychopathology. This analysis provides evidence that the DSM CCM is a valuable tool in reviewing broad symptomatology in FHR patients, as opposed to focusing solely on categorical diagnoses. Our study supports that DSM CCM domains can be used to integrate RDoC domains within the clinical context and also help in elucidating neurobiology related to broad psychosis spectrum psychopathology. Background: Atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPD), e.g. clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, lurasidone, are effective to treat positive and negative symptoms in some patients with schizophrenia (SCZ). We have shown that a key feature of most AAPDs is their more potent 5-HT2A inverse agonism, than D2 receptor antagonism. Selective 5-HT2A inverse agonists, e.g. M1009077 and SR43469B, are themselves effective to treat positive and negative symptoms in some acutely psychotic SCZ patients. We have also reported that augmentation of low doses of risperidone with pimavanserin (Pim), a selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist approved for treatment of psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease, leads to more rapid onset of antipsychotic effect with fewer side effects in acutely psychotic SCZ patients. Whether augmentation of standard doses of AAPDs with PIM would lead to beneficial effect on positive and negative symptoms in patients who are resistant to AAPDs is currently under investigation.",

They can be grouped into three categories: general sociodemographic information (e.g., gender, age, marital status), past medical history of the patient (e.g., number of previous admissions, history of previous suicide attempts, average length of stay up until that admission), and information of the most recent admission (e.g., length of stay, number and length of the notes, GAF [Global Assessment Function] score, level of insight, treatment compliance). The classifier includes clinical sentiment analysis scores for seven risk factor domains associated with readmission risk (Appearance, Mood, Interpersonal, Occupation, Thought Content, Thought Process, and Substance). These sentiment scores were automatically obtained through a topic extraction and sentiment analysis pipeline that evaluate the state of the patient concerning each of these risk factor domains for every note in the admission. Figure 1 . Data pipeline for training and evaluating our readmission risk prediction model. Results: We trained six different classification models: a Stochastic Gradient Descent, a Logistic Regression, a C-Support Vector, a Decision Tree, a Random Forest, and a Multilayer Perceptron. All of them were implemented and fine-tuned using the scikit-learn machine learning toolkit. The Random Forest classifier resulted in the best accuracy (F1= 0.72 and accuracy= 0.70), followed by Decision Tree (F1= 0.62 and accuracy= 0.64). The most useful features to be included in the models were: the existence of prior history of suicidal attempts, the GAF scores, the insight values, and occupation.",

Psychotropic medications commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia (SZ), including antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and sedative/ hypnotics, frequently have strong anticholinergic properties. Since cognitive impairment is a core feature of SZ, excessive anticholinergic burden imparted by medications may further compromise cognitive functioning. This study examined the relationship between anticholinergic medication burden and cognition in a large cohort of SZ patients. Methods: Anticholinergic medication burden was calculated using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale (ACB) in SZ patients (n = 1,113) and healthy subjects (HS, n = 989) enrolled in the cross-sectional Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia (COGS-2) study.

In the SRS-2 completed for adults by an informant, higher social impairment was also associated with lower interdaily stability (p = 0.02) as well as higher intradaily variability (p = 0.03).

A negative feedback system involving glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) regulates HPA axis activity and cortisol secretion. Heavy alcohol use and withdrawal are associated with dysregulation of the HPA axis and disruption of glucocorticoid signaling. In a human laboratory study, the non-selective partial GR receptor antagonist, mifepristone, reduced both excessive drinking and alcohol craving in recently abstinent alcohol-dependent volunteers. In preclinical studies, both mifepristone and selective GR antagonists reduced alcohol self-administration, providing evidence for a specific role of GRs in compulsive-like alcohol intake. PT150, formerly known as ORG 34517, is a novel, highly selective GR competitive antagonist. In preclinical studies, PT150 reduced the severity of alcohol withdrawal and related HPA axis activation. In contrast to mifepristone, which has a 5.4-fold greater affinity for GR than progesterone receptors (PRs), PT150 has a nearly 500-fold greater affinity for GRs than PRs. Because selective antagonism of GRs may increase tolerance and reduce side effects, we conducted a human laboratory study to determine the 1) safety of concurrent alcohol administration after 5-days of PT150 treatment, and 2) potential efficacy of PT150 for reducing both the acute subjective effects of alcohol and alcohol craving.",

Pharmacodynamic endpoints, which included the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES), the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ), the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), and the Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group (PCAG), Amphetamine (AMP), Morphine-Benzedrine Group (MBG), Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), and Benzedrine (BG) scales from the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) were measured before, and at regular intervals for 2-hours after, all 4 alcohol challenge sessions. We measured vital signs, including heart rate and blood pressure, and the concentration of alcohol (ethanol) in the participant's breath, via breathalyzer, at the same intervals. Additionally, we obtained levels of cortisol, potassium, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and lipids before administration of PT150 on Day 1, and after administration of PT150 on Day 3 (cortisol and potassium) and Day 6 (cortisol, potassium, TSH, and lipids).

While most smokers want to quit smoking, self-efficacy for change is often low and many remain in the contemplation stage for years. Methods: We conducted an RCT in 204 low-income AA smokers of a novel Enhanced Care (EC) condition consisting of brief singlesession motivational, culturally-tailored feedback intervention with a one-week starter kit of nicotine replacement versus a Treatment As Usual (TAU) condition with distribution of self-help materials and pamphlets. Smoking behavior, use of nicotine replacement, and urinary levels of the tobacco specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) were the main dependent variables examined at baseline and 1-month follow-up. NNAL levels were assayed by LC-MS/MS at NicoTAR\u00ae labs at the Roswell Park Cancer Center. Retention was high with 203 participants (99.5%) completing the 1-month follow-up. The average age was 53.8 years, 50% were female, and 76% were not working (i.e., unemployed, retired, or disabled) . Smoking level at enrollment was 8.8 (range: 1-37) cigarettes per day with 96% preferring mentholated cigarettes.",

Specifically, an imbalance between increased drug-oriented motivation and decreased inhibitory control is considered to contribute towards the development and maintenance of substance using disorders (Everitt & Robbins, 2005; Koob & Volkow, 2010) . Dampened behavioral inhibition and overactive behavioral approach motivational systems (i.e., BIS/BAS) have been identified in cannabis use disorder (CUD; Silins et al., 2013) , although the underlying neural mechanisms of these alterations have not yet been examined. In this study, given the findings of increased resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in the brain's executive control network (ECN) (Krmpotich et al., 2013) with increased approach motivation and a lateralization effect of BIS/ BAS within the ECN (Schutter, Weijer, Meuwese, Morgan, & Honk, 2008) , we will test the hypothesis that altered ECN rsFC compared to non-users underlies drug-oriented motivation and decreased inhibitory control in cannabis users. Methods: To that end, we tested potential differences in the relationship between ECN rsFC and BIS/BAS in cannabis using (N = 86, mean age= 30.54, 42 males) and non-using adults (N = 59, mean age= 29.42, 31 males). To compare total BIS and the three BAS subscale scores between users and non-users we ran a MANOVA. We also modeled the relationship between the motivation systems as a BIS/BAS ratio calculated according to Schutter and colleagues [(Schutter et al., 2008) : BIS/BAS = (BIS-BAS)/(BIS + BAS)]. Using this equation, positive ratios reflect an imbalance towards BIS, while negative values reflect an imbalance towards BAS. Independent component analysis (ICA) was performed in FSL's MELODIC (FMRIB's Software Library http://fsl. fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) to determine participants' rsFC. Then, left and right ECN masks (Shirer et al., 2012) were used to identify which group ICA components were spatially correlated to the a priori networks of interest. Further analysis was limited to the components identified as correlates. Next, a general linear model (GLM) was performed to compare the strength of the ECN, as determined by ICA, with BIS/BAS scores. Finally, a second GLM was constructed to detect significant variation between users and controls in the contrast parameter estimates (COPEs) of BIS/BAS scores within the ECN. Where significant correlations between BIS/ BAS scores and ECN strength were compared between groups.",

In addition, cannabis users' increased COPE values of BAS-reward responsiveness in the right ECN rsFC compared to non-users suggests right ECN functionality is influenced by their level of reward responsivity. Therefore, cannabis users who are conditioned to expect and crave drug-related stimuli (as evidenced by increased BAS-reward responsiveness) should also have increased right ECN rsFC. Cannabis users' BIS/BAS ratios were more negative compared to controls suggesting an imbalance towards BAS. However, due to the inconsistency with our findings between the participants' BIS/BAS ratios and ECN rsFC compared to others in the literature (Schutter et al., 2008; Rutherford & Lindell, 2011) , further examination is needed to investigate other possible neural correlates of the BIS/BAS ratio. This differential connectivity between cannabis users and non-users could indicate that ECN rsFC is a contributing factor to CUD symptomatology, as indicated in its correlation to BIS and BAS scores in this study. As such, these results suggest that a relationship between brain network connectivity and motivation systems influences cannabis use behavior.",

Preclinical studies showed that repeated administration of cocaine altered dopaminergic signaling and motivational behaviors. As part of the limbic system, the hypothalamus receives extensive dopaminergic projections from the midbrain and is implicated in a wide range of motivated behaviors. Many studies have described hypothalamic response to arousal, food intake, sexual drive, extrinsic reward and affective responses. However, it remains unclear how hypothalamic dysfunction contributes to motivation deficits in addiction. A critical component of motivation lies with the internal drive to engage in actions without apparent reward. Intrinsic motivation refers to the spontaneous tendency to seek out challenges and to explore. A recent work examined the neural correlates of intrinsic motivation using a stopwatch task (SWT) in which participants were to stop the watch within a specified time interval. By having participants choose (self-determined condition or SD) or be assigned (forced condition or FC) a SW in alterative trials, authors examined how motivation influences cerebral activations while keeping task difficulty and performance outcomes identical. The hypothalamus showed increased activation during self-as compared to forced-choices. In the current study, we examined the hypothalamic response to intrinsic motivation using SWT.",

Cue-induced cravings are known to escalate over the period of withdrawal, a phenomenon termed the incubation of drug craving. Expression of incubated cocaine craving is ultimately mediated by the synaptic strengthening of excitatory inputs onto medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core. Specifically, during withdrawal, post-synaptic accumulation of high conductance Ca2 + -permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) enhances MSN reactivity to glutamatergic inputs and drug-associated cues to drive the expression of incubation. Additionally, we have shown that the regulation of glutamate release may be impaired after prolonged withdrawal, as mGlu5-and CB1R-mediated synaptic depression induced by DHPG is abolished. Our previous studies suggest that this impairment stems from alterations in the post-synaptic endocannabinoid signaling complex referred to as the 2-AG signalosome. Here, we investigated mechanisms underlying this impairment.",

An increase in functional connectivity was found between medial and lateral visual networks during SA scans (p = .002), perhaps reflecting changes in visual processing. Analyses on functional connectivity dynamics, specifically variance and entropy, revealed that SA reduced variability but increased entropy across the brain, including within and between most canonical networks. However, these effects on connectivity dynamics were small, and using a leave one subject out classification procedure, we found that static connectivity alone best predicted whether a scan was collected during placebo or SA (75% accuracy), with variability and entropy adding little and sometimes even reducing classification accuracy.",

Background: Research on substance use and misuse typically revolves around the drug as a reinforcer, but drugs of abuse also elicit internal stimulus effects that can be learned as guides of behaviour. Whereas the bulk of that work has used operant twolever drug discrimination tasks, the Pavlovian associations that are so central to triggering motivated behaviours associated with substance abuse remain understudied. Occasion setters disambiguate associations between conditioned stimuli (CSs) and unconditioned stimuli (USs) and can activate or inhibit US seeking in response to a CS presentation, depending on the associative structure in place. Several drugs with varying levels of abuse potential have been established as effective feature negative (FN) and/or feature positive (FP) occasion setters in male rats, including nicotine, cocaine, methamphetamine, chlordiazepoxide, and caffeine. Given the massive, and growing, public health concern surrounding opioids, we've begun this line of research using morphine as a positive feature that indicates a CS-US relation is active and morphine as a negative feature that indicates a CS-US relation is inactive in both male and female rats to assess whether the specificity of the drug stimulus to guide behaviour is similar for both sexes.",

All rats were injected intraperitoneally with either morphine (3.2 mg/ kg; 1 ml/kg) or saline 15-min before 20-min daily training sessions in standard operant conditioning chambers. During these sessions, there were eight 15-sec white noise (WN) presentations (80 dB). For FP rats, on morphine sessions, each WN offset was followed by 4-sec access to sucrose (0.01 ml; 26% w/v); on saline sessions, the WN was still presented, but sucrose was withheld. For FN rats, sucrose was delivered on saline sessions and withheld on morphine sessions. Saline and morphine sessions were intermixed such that no more than two of a session type occurred in a row. The measure of conditioning was the first dipper entry difference score: the number of anticipatory dipper entries during the 15-sec WN CS minus the number of dipper entries during the 15-sec pre-CS interval. Only the first WN presentation of each session was used as the measure of learning because the first sucrose delivery (or lack of sucrose delivery) of any given session provides insight into how all subsequent CS presentations in that session would be followed. After 32 total training sessions (16 morphine; 16 saline), all rats entered stimulus generalization testing. For this phase, each rat was assessed in one standard morphine and one saline session. If its dipper entry difference score was at least 4 higher on its CS-active session than its CS-inactive session, then it would go on to test the next day. Test sessions were 4 min and contained only one WN presentation and no sucrose delivery. Each rat was challenged with each of a series of morphine doses in a latin-square order (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.1, 3.2, 5.4 mg/kg). Due to the observed response patterns as rats worked their way through their testing cycles, higher doses of 6.5 and 7.5 mg/kg were added to the female testing orders midway through the testing cycle.",

This finding cannot be explained by tolerance to the training drug, as intervening training sessions required a standard baseline discrimination to qualify to test. This finding also exemplifies the need to reassess our notions of drug stimuli that guide appropriate associative behaviours from the perspective of sex differences.

Background: Methamphetamine (meth) causes enduring changes within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) circuitry. Projections from the mPFC to the NAc have a distinct dorsal-ventral distribution; neurons originating in the prelimbic (PL) mPFC project to the NAc core, whereas, those originating in the infralimbic (IL) mPFC project to the NAc shell. Inhibition of these parallel pathways has opposing effects on cocaine relapse. Inhibition of PL-NAc core reduces cued reinstatement of cocaine seeking following extinction and IL-NAc shell inhibition reinstates previously extinguished cocaine seeking. Meth, however, exhibits a different profile, as pharmacological inhibition of both the PL and IL decrease cued reinstatement of meth-seeking. Given these contrasting findings, the opposing roles of the PL-NAc core and IL-NAc shell found with cocaine remains unclear in regard to meth seeking. Methods: To begin to address this issue, we used a combinational viral approach that employs a retrograde traveling AAV-Cre (AAVrg-Cre) injected in the terminal area and a Cre-dependent AAV inhibitory DREADD (DIO-hM4Di) in the cell body locus. Specifically, one group of rats received AAVrg-Cre in the NAc core and DIO-hM4Di in the PL and another had AAVrg-Cre in the NAc shell and DIO-hM4Di in the IL. Male and female rats selfadministered meth (2 hr daily) then went through extinction and reinstatement testing.

Indeed, cannabis is one of the most commonly used drugs in adolescents, and exposure to \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of marijuana may produce intracellular and synaptic perturbations that disrupt the process of brain maturation and persist into adulthood. For example, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is integral to cognitive functions such as the representation of working memory (WM), and this region undergoes robust developmental changes during adolescence. Human, primate, and rodent studies suggest that chronic adolescent exposure to high levels of cannabinoids like THC can impact PFC function to produce WM deficits. However, clinical studies are not able to control for a number of associated variables, and preclinical studies have often only identified deficits at high experimenter-administered doses that likely produce aversive rather than rewarding effects. Thus, we endeavored to develop a paradigm to achieve selfadministration of high doses of THC in adolescents, and determine if this pattern of adolescent exposure may dosedependently affect WM performance in adulthood. We hypothesized that chronic exposure to THC at voluntarily selfadministered doses would result in enhanced drug-seeking behaviors and altered performance on a delay-match-to-sample working memory task. Methods: Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with indwelling catheters on PND 25. Rats then began operant self-administration of escalating doses of THC, reaching a final dose of 30 (moderate dose) or 100 \u03bcg/kg/ infusion (high dose) over 20 days (PND 32-51, n = 10-12 per group). A subset of animals were assessed for analgesia using a tail-flick test immediately following a self-administration test to confirm exposure to physiologically relevant doses of THC. Next, lever pressing behavior was extinguished during 9 days of lever extinction (PND 52-60). Rats were then tested for cue-induced reinstatement and incubation of THC-seeking after 10 and 30 days of abstinence. Concurrently during abstinence, rats were trained and tested on an operant-based delay-match-to-sample working memory task. During this task, rats learned to nose poke into one of 5 illuminated sample ports to receive a sucrose pellet reward. After learning to respond into a specific sample port, rats were trained to perform the task when a variable delay period (0-24s) elapsed before the originally sampled port and 2 adjacent ports were illuminated. The rat then had to choose the originally sampled port to receive a reward. Accuracy on this task was analyzed at increasingly difficult delays to compare the effects of THC exposure on working memory performance. Group differences were assessed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA.",

Background: The mechanism of action of ketamine is generally attributed to noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism. However, classic NMDAR antagonists do not recapitulate the full behavioral and pharmacological profile of ketamine, which is also known to bind to other targets in the CNS. 'Ketamine' is a racemic mixture of the R-and S-enantiomers. Sketamine was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of depression. Interestingly, R-ketamine exhibits~4 times reduced affinity for NMDAR compared to S-ketamine but is more potent in preclinical antidepressant models. Furthermore, the ketamine metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) lacks appreciable binding to NMDAR yet maintains a preclinical antidepressant profile. Several clinical and preclinical studies have reported interactions between ketamine and the opioid system. Opioid antagonists can block the positive effects of low doses of ketamine and higher doses of ketamine produce dissociative effects similar to those caused by kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonists. The objective of this study was to characterize the precise pharmacological action of the different ketamine enantiomers and HNK on opioid receptors and to examine whether any such interactions were relevant to ketamine's abuse liability and/ or its potential for modulating opioid-dependent behaviors.",

Surprisingly, the archetypical NMDAR allosteric antagonist MK-801, with structural similarities to ketamine, was also able to bind opioid receptors with affinities similar to S-ketamine. Both R-and S-ketamine were partial agonists at MOR while MK-801 was a full agonist. Sketamine and MK-801 were full agonists at KOR while R-ketamine was only a partial agonist. None of the drugs were able to activate DOR and remarkably HNK was unable to activate either opioid receptor.

Background: The use of multiple substances, particularly stimulants and opioids, is not a new phenomenon, and there is increasing awareness polysubstance abuse is the norm rather than the exception. Indeed, although the co-injection of cocaine and heroin has been common for decades, recent estimates suggest that the popularity of stimulant-opioid mixtures is growing, with over 50% of treatment-seeking opioid users reporting regular stimulant use. The goal of the current study was to determine how opioid dependence and withdrawal affect the relative reinforcing effects of opioids (e.g., fentanyl), as well as stimulant (e.g., methamphetamine and cocaine). Methods: Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 8) were trained to self-administer 3.2 \u03bcg/kg/inf fentanyl under a progressive ration (PR) schedule of reinforcement. Once stable, dose substitution was used to generate full PR dose-response curves for fentanyl (0.032-10 \u03bcg/kg/inf), methamphetamine (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg/inf), and cocaine (0.032-1.78 mg/kg/inf). Next, opioid dependence was established by administering escalating doses of morphine (10, 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg; SC) twice-daily (every 12hrs) for four days, and maintained by oncedaily injections of 40 mg/kg morphine. In order to evaluate the impact of opioid dependence and withdrawal the daily selfadministration session occurred 12hrs, or 20hrs after the maintenance dose of morphine. During this phase, PR doseresponse curves for fentanyl (0.032-32 \u03bcg/kg/inf) were predetermined, with the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine (0.032 mg/kg/inf) or cocaine (0.32 mg/kg/inf) evaluated approximately every 10 days.",

The current studies provide direct evidence that rats in a state of opioid withdrawal work harder to obtain fentanyl compared to rats that are not physically dependent on opioids, and that the reinforcing effects of fentanyl are suppressed in rats currently dependent on opioids. Opioid dependence and withdrawal did not affect the reinforcing effectiveness of methamphetamine or cocaine. Taken together, these findings suggest that motivations to use opioids are highly dependent on the state of the individual, and influenced by negative reinforcing effects of the opioid, whereas stimulants retain their positive reinforcing effects regardless of whether the individual is in a state of opioid dependence or withdrawal. The latter could contribute to the growing popularity of stimulants among opioid users, as well as the increasing prevalence of overdose deaths attributed to the co-use of opioids and stimulants.",

The selective chemotype targeting of the 5-HT2CR is challenging given the similarity of the orthosteric sites across the 5-HT2R family, such that 5-HT2AR or 5-HT2BR agonists are expected to evoke hallucinations or cardiac valvulopathy, respectively. Targeting 5-HT2CR allosteric site(s), which differ from the orthosteric site for endogenous 5-HT, creates new opportunities to optimize 5-HT2CR signaling in disorders marked by hypofunctional 5-HT2CR signaling. We have reported the discovery of several 5-HT2CR PAMs and have subsequently focused on chemical optimizations imperative to ultimate clinical success.

Background: Cocaine use disorder causes significant health and financial burdens to society; however, no effective treatments currently exist. One of the biggest hurdles for successful treatment is the high likelihood of relapse in abstinent individuals. Relapse is often triggered by exposure to the environmental stimuli or cues that were associated with prior cocaine use. Thus, a potential treatment strategy is to reduce the strength of cocaine-associated memories, thus reducing the likelihood of relapse. One such strategy, exposure therapy, involves a process known as memory extinction, where cues are presented repeatedly in the absence of drug reinforcement. Unfortunately, clinical application of exposure therapy has met with limited success. One possible reason for the disappointing clinical efficacy of exposure therapy is that in that later stages of addiction use can become habitual or compulsive and this may lead to the execution of drug taking actions independent of the current value of the cue that predicts the outcome of those actions. In other words, we hypothesized that habit systems may occlude the ability of cue extinction to reduce cue motivated drug seeking behavior. Methods: In order to test this hypothesis, we trained Sprague-Dawley rats to self-administer intravenous cocaine paired with an audiovisual cue on either a fixed ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement known to promote goal-directed drug seeking or on a second order (SO) schedule of reinforcement known to promote putatively habitual drug seeking. We first verified that FR and SO training were differentially sensitive to inhibition of dopamine seeking in the dorsal lateral striatum (DLS) to verify the use of goal-directed versus habitual response strategies, respectively. Intracranial guide cannula were implanted in the DLS and the dopamine receptor antagonist alpha-flupenthixol was infused prior to a test of cue-motivated cocaine seeking in both groups We next tested the efficacy of cue extinction learning to reduce cue-induced reinstatement by dividing animals under each training schedule into groups exposed to 0, 120, or 240 cues using a passive exposure procedure. Cue-induced reinstatement was tested the following day. Finally, we determined if restoring goal-directed behavior by infusing the AMPA antagonist NBQX in the DLS could reveal the effects of cue extinction learning in SO trained rats. Data were analyzed using ANOVAs with DLS infusion, schedule, and extinction conditions as separate between subjects factors. Bonferroni's post-hoc tests followed significant interactions.",

Finally, we found that inhibition of DLS glutamate signaling at the time of the reinstatement test restored goal-directed behavior and revealed the effect of cue extinction, where 0 cue exposed control rats showed high levels of drug seeking after NBQX, while 120 cue exposed rats infused with NBQX showed low levels of drug seeking, consistent with effective extinction learning.",

                "text": "Keywords Background: Adolescence is a dynamic period of brain maturation, which underscores the development of higher order cognition and emotional behaviours in which the endocannabinoid system plays a critical role. Hence, chronic exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), the major psychoactive compound in marijuana during adolescence may interfere with the maturation and refinement of neural circuitry, with the potential for long-lasting behavioural consequences. Supporting this view is epidemiological evidence linking early cannabis use to increased risk for psychosis and data from rodent models suggesting longterm disruption of cognitive and emotional behaviours following chronic adolescent \u03949-THC exposure (Renard et al., Can. J. Psychiatry, 2016) . We therefore set out to identify the specific neuroanatomical circuits by which adolescent \u03949-THC exposure may predispose the developing brain for later onset of psychopathology. To do so, we combined a validated rat model of adolescent \u03949-THC exposure with an assessment of adult rat brain macrostructure using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with voxel-wise computational neuroanatomical analysis tools. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats (male) were exposed to escalating (2.5; 5; 10 mg/kg; intraperitoneal [i.p.]; n = 10) doses of \u03949-THC (T2386, Sigma-Aldrich, UK n = 10) or drug vehicle (a 1:1:18 ratio of poly-ethylene glycol, Tween-80 and sterile saline; n = 10) during adolescence, defined as post-natal day (P) 35-45 (Rubino et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2008) . To confirm \u03949-THC exposure, a plasma sample was collected from the tail vein on P44, 30 minutes after injection. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the concentrations of \u03949-THC in rat plasma with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection. Animals were left undisturbed until adulthood (P80) and culled by cardiac perfusion (0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde) under terminal anaesthesia (sodium pentobarbital, 60 mg/kg i.p). Perfusion-fixed brain tissues were kept intact in the cranium and post-fixed for 24 hours in 4% PFA followed by 4 weeks in 0.01M phosphate buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide at 4\u00b0C. T2-weighted ex vivo 3D MR images were then acquired using a 7T small bore MRI scanner (Agilent technologies) and a quadrature volume radiofrequency (RF) coil (39 mm inner diameter, RAPID Biomedical) using the following parameters: TE/TR=60/2000, echo train length = 8, matrix size = 192x128x192 and field of view (FOV) = 28.8x19.2x28.8 mm, yielding isotropic voxels of 150 \u03bcm3. Total scan-time per brain was 1hr 44min. One MR image was excluded from the \u03949-THC group due to visible dissection damage in the cerebellum, hence the final n-values for group comparisons were vehicle, n = 10 and \u03949-THC, n = 9. MR images were converted to NIFTI format and processed using a combination of FSL, ANTs and in-house C + + software utilizing the ITK library, available from https://github.com/spinicist/QUIT. Data were then analysed for group level differences using voxel-wise tensor-based morphometry (TBM) and automated cortical thickness analysis. Specifically, we performed voxel or vertexwise t-tests, including total brain volume as a covariate (Vernon et al., Biological Psychiatry, 2014) , The resulting maps were then corrected for multiple comparisons using the family-wise error rate (FWE p < 0.05).",

                "text": "Keywords Background: Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance and alcoholism is one of the leading causes of disease and premature deaths in modern societies. A large body of research has implicated that repeated excessive alcohol use, often triggered by stress, seems to start a vicious cycle to promote escalated alcohol intake. Currently, however, there is substantial gap in our understanding of the neural mechanisms that drive a transition from controlled alcohol consumption to the development of alcohol seeking and dependence. The amygdala, a critical neural substrate of both aversive and appetitive behaviors, is directly affected by a variety of addictive substances. Recently, studies in mice have indicated that distinct subpopulations of neurons within the amygdala are differentially responsible for the activation and inhibition of fear memory. In addition, divergent ensemble activity from these subpopulations seems to mediate positive or negative valence coding. Specifically, we have found that a specific excitatory neuronal population in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), marked by Thy1 expression (Thy1 + ), serve as 'Fear-Off' neurons. They also heavily project to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a core structure for reward-based learning and substance addiction, instead of the central amygdala (CeA), suggesting that these neurons directly inhibit fear and may support appetitive behavior. Understanding the roles of this molecularly identified population in alcohol related behaviors is central to our study. Methods: First, to determine whether Thy1 + neurons are involved in associative Pavlovian conditioning with alcohol, we employed a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm with systemic injection of alcohol (EtOH, 2g/kg BW) in male mice (N = 3; control n = 12, EtOH n = 12). Then, we have mapped EtOH-CPPinduced neuronal activity changes by quantifying the number of c-Fos protein-expressing (c-Fos + ) neurons in the BLA of Thy1-eYFP mice. Second, to investigate the roles of BLA Thy1 + neurons and their projections during conditioning or recall phase, we performed inhibitory optogenetic manipulation in Thy1 + neurons using Thy1-Cre driver mice and AAV encoding Credependent halorhodopsin (eNpHR) or eYFP. AAV-eNpHR was injected to the BLA, but optic fibers were bilaterally implanted above the BLA (N = 3; control n = 11, EtOH n =10), NAcc (N = 3; control n = 9, EtOH n = 12) or prefrontal cortex (PFC) (N = 2; control n = 8, EtOH n = 7).",

Background: Cocaine memories become labile upon retrieval and require protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation into longterm memory stores in order to persist over time. Substance use disorder patients report pathologically salient and intrusive cocaine memories, which perpetuate drug use. Thus, reconsolidation provides an interesting therapeutic target in that interference with memory reconsolidation weakens memories both in rodent models of drug relapse and in human models of cue-induced drug craving. Our laboratory has shown that cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) stimulation within the basolateral amygdala (BLA) regulates the reconsolidation of cocaine memories in rats, and AM251-mediated CB1R antagonism in the BLA enhances postreconsolidation memory strength and prolongs memory retrievalassociated rises in plasma corticosterone levels. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of distinct endocannabinoids and potential sex differences to this phenomenon. Methods: To promote the acquisition of context1-responsecocaine associative memories, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer IV cocaine infusions by pressing a lever in a distinct context. Rats then received extinction training in a distinctly different context to promote the acquisition of context2response-no cocaine associations. On post-cocaine day 8, rats were exposed to the cocaine context for 15 min, in order to trigger cocaine memory retrieval, destabilization, and reconsolidation. Immediately after the memory retrieval session (\"reactivation groups) or six hours later (no reactivation groups), rats received bilateral intra-BLA microinfusions of the FAAH inhibitor, URB597 (1 \u03bcg/side or Veh), the DAGL inhibitor, DO34 (1.67 \u03bcg/side or Veh), or the MAGL inhibitor, JZL185 (1 \u03bcg/side or Veh), in order to manipulate levels of two endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2arachydonoyl glycerol (2-AG).

One emerging treatment strategy for opioid use disorder includes immunopharmacotherapies or opioid-targeted vaccines. Recent preclinical research has explored the development of combination immunopharmacotherapy approaches directed at multiple, structurally dissimilar and commonly abused opioids (e.g., fentanyl and heroin). The present study evaluated the effectiveness of a fentanyl/heroin conjugate vaccine on fentanyl/heroin mixture selfadministration and antinociception in rats. Methods: 12 Sprague-Dawley rats (6 male, 6 female) were acquired at 10 weeks of age (Envigo Laboratories, New Jersey, USA) and surgically implanted with custom jugular catheters and vascular access ports (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Animals were singly housed in a vivarium maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights off at 6:00 PM). Water and food were provided ad lib in the home cage. Animal maintenance and research were conducted in accordance with the 2011 guidelines of the NIH Committee on Laboratory Animal Resources and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experiment 1 (3 males/3 females) examined heroin/fentanyl conjugate vaccine effects on 1:27 fentanyl/heroin selfadministration and experiment 2 (3 males/3 females) examined vaccine effects on heroin alone, fentanyl alone, 1:27 fentanyl/ heroin mixture, and methadone (control) in a warm-water tail withdrawal procedure (50\u00b0C). In experiment 1, rats was trained to respond under a concurrent FR5:FR5 \"choice\" schedule of liquid food and fentanyl/heroin mixture availability. The behavioral session consisted of five 20-min response components each preceded by a 4-min \"sample\" component. During each response component, both levers were extended, a red stimulus light above the left lever was illuminated to signal liquid food availability and a green stimulus light above the right lever was illuminated to signal fentanyl availability. FR5 completion on the left lever resulted in a 5-s presentation of liquid food; whereas, FR5 completion on the right lever resulted in fentanyl delivery. Responding on one lever reset the ratio requirement for the other lever. A different 1:27 fentanyl/heroin mixture dose was available during each of the five successive response components (0, 0.32, 1.0, 3.2, and 10 \u03bcg/kg/inj during components 1-5, respectively based on fentanyl dose). A 1:27 fentanyl/heroin mixture was selected based on the relative individual potencies (ED50) for fentanyl and heroin alone in the warm-water tail withdrawal procedure. Mixture dose varied by changing the infusion duration and visually signaled by the frequency of the flashing right green light above the drug-associated lever in 3-s cycles. Choice training was considered stable when the smallest mixture dose that maintained at least 80% of completed ratio requirements on the mixture-associated lever was non-trending for three consecutive days. In Experiment 2, each session began by gently wrapping the rat with a towel, leaving the tail exposed. The distal five cm of the tail was immersed in heated water (50\u00b0C) and the latency to fully remove the tail was recorded with a digital chronograph with a 0.01 s resolution (Sports Timer, Fisher Brand, Hampton, NH) . If the rat did not remove its tail by 20 s, the experimenter removed the tail and a latency of 20 s was assigned. Following baseline latency determination, IV saline or fentanyl (1-1000 \u03bcg/kg), heroin (32-320 \u03bcg/kg), 1:27 fentanyl/heroin mixture, methadone (320-3200 \u03bcg/kg) was administered followed by a 0.1 mL saline flush and tail-withdrawal latency was redetermined 2 min later for opioid agonists alone or in a mixture. Four vaccine boosts were administered (weeks 0, 2, 4, and 10) and behavioral effects were tracked over 14 weeks.",

Methods: Single-trial fear conditioning and extinction. Rats were exposed to a novel context in which 3 inescapable electrostatic footshocks were delivered in a single session. NYX-783 (1 mg/kg, PO), the NMDAR glycine site agonist D-cycloserine (15 mg/kg, SC), or vehicle was given one time only (1 h prior to the first extinction session). Rats underwent 6 daily extinction sessions in the same context without foot shock. Rats were then returned to their home cage for 7 days before being subjected to the fear conditioning context for a single session to evaluate spontaneous recovery of conditioned fear. Partially reinforced fear conditioning and extinction. Mice were placed in a novel context for 6 contiguous days; footshock was delivered on days 1, 4, and 6. This fear conditioning paradigm is known to induce extinction-resistant fear. Next, mice were returned to the same context for 6 daily extinction sessions without footshock. NYX-783 (10 mg/kg, IP), D-cycloserine (15 mg/kg, SC), or vehicle was administered 1 h prior to each extinction session. Alcohol self-administration, extinction, and reinstatement. A separate, treatment-naive rat cohort underwent restraint stress in the presence of sandalwood odor 3 days prior to voluntary operant alcohol self-administration (fixed-ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement, 10% v/v). Control rats underwent sham stress, which consisted of placing these rats in a novel environment paired with sandalwood odor. After meeting self-administration criteria (stable responding and > 80 mg% blood alcohol concentration), extinction sessions commenced under selfadministration conditions, but no alcohol was delivered upon schedule completion. After meeting extinction criteria, reinstatement was precipitated by exposure to sandalwood odor in the operant chamber.

However, Dcycloserine had no effect on spontaneous recovery of fear, whereas the single NYX-783 administration significantly reduced spontan-eous recovery of previously extinguished conditioned fear. In the alcohol self-administration study, restraint stress increased alcohol self-administration (compared to sham stress) and rendered alcohol-seeking behavior resistant to extinction.

Conclusions: NYX-783 significantly facilitated extinction of conditioned fear across 2 rodent species and 2 conditioning paradigms.

During these periods, transient \"proximal\" cues were presented contingent with a drug seeking response and coincident with each cocaine infusion. Following this, rats underwent a \"conflict\" phase, wherein they had to overcome a cost (crossing an electrified floor barrier) in order to continue to use cocaine. This cost escalated between sessions until drug seeking was suppressed. Rats then underwent relapse tests where we presented the proximal, drug-delivery associated cue in the presence or absence of the global drug availability cue to assess its ability to evoke relapse.

Following two weeks of abstinence, we next assessed the ability of the proximal, drug-delivery associated cues to trigger relapse despite the continued presence of cost. Proximal cues were presented noncontingently in the presence or absence of global cues that had signaled drug availability during intermittent access. Critically, we found that the ability of proximal cues to trigger relapse was gated by the presence of global drug available cues (p < .05), suggesting that hierarchical cue interactions exert an important modulating influence on drug-seeking motivation.

In contrast, inconsistent sleep time had significant detrimental effects on behavior and in brain function during task and at rest. Our study provides evidence for the importance of consistent sleep time and of the beneficial effect of WE catch-up sleep in individuals with mild sleep loss.",

Participants met 4.5 SCID criteria for AW, had 83% heavy drinking days, and 11 drinks/day in the 90 days prior to screening. They were assessed for medical stability, alcohol severity, and administered a validated AW symptom self-rating form (Pittman 2007) .

Compared to past studies the main difference in this study was that participants were chosen based on their past self-reported AW symptoms. Indeed, when levels of AW symptoms are taken into account, only those with the more intense symptoms benefitted from gabapentin. This finding is consistent with a number of previous reports suggesting gabapentin is useful for AW treatment and perhaps extending into the post-withdrawal period. Its unique pharmacology of altering voltage sensitive calcium channels with secondary effects on brain GABA and glutamate function is also consistent with its effectiveness in treatment-seekers with AW, who, perhaps also have protracted withdrawal states that would lead to early relapse drinking that could be diminished by gabapentin. Future studies should evaluate the role of sleep change, mood, and negative aspects of drinking on gabapentin response.",

Here, we assessed the effects of chronic intermittent exposure to ethanol vapor on alcohol-seeking elicited by cues predicting alcohol availability, and the brain networks recruited by these cues. Methods: Male and female Long-Evans rats (n = 35) were preexposed to 15% ethanol and then trained in a discriminative stimulus task. In this task, one auditory cue (the discriminative stimulus; DS) signals ethanol availability; if the rat enters the reward delivery port during the cue it receives ethanol. A control cue (the neutral stimulus; NS) signals nothing. After learning to discriminate between these cues, half of the rats underwent chronic, intermittent exposure to ethanol vapor 14 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 3 weeks to induce alcohol dependence. Two weeks after the induction of dependence, rats underwent a cue probe test, in which the DS and NS cues under extinction conditions, to determine whether they would alter their responses to these cues. Rats then underwent a series of reacquisition sessions identical to training, in which ethanol was delivered when rats entered the port during the DS cue.

Background: Chronic use of alcohol can result in alcohol use disorder (AUD), a chronic relapsing disorder that is often untreated. Only a subset of alcohol users develop AUD. Individual variability in the development of AUD likely reflects the interaction between chronic alcohol use, as well as biological, psychosocial, and environmental risk factors. Recently, family history, male sex, and higher delay discounting impulsivity were found to be significant risk factors for high rates of binge drinking during an alcohol self-administration challenge. However, it remains unknown if other clinical variables are associated with alcohol self-administration phenotypes, which themselves may reflect risk factors for the development of AUD. This study aimed to examine clinical predictors of alcohol self-administration phenotypes in heavy drinking individuals. Methods: Non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers (n = 67; 36M/ 31F; age = 29.09 \u00b1 6.56) completed an intravenous alcohol administration paradigm combining an alcohol challenge (target BrAC = 0.06 g/dl) and a progressive ratio alcohol selfadministration (maximum BrAC = 0.12 g/dl). Growth curve analysis was conducted on the self-administration data to identify self-administration phenotypes. Two follow-up analyses were conducted characterize clinical variables that predicted cluster membership. First, a logistic regression was conducted using previously identified risk factors for AUD (sex, family history, and delay discounting impulsivity).

Background: Several behavioral factors have been associated with the propensity to develop alcohol use disorder (AUD). In the clinical and animal literature, both the acute stimulatory and anxiolytic responses to alcohol are known to confer vulnerability for AUD. However, the underlying neural circuitry is unknown. The mesolimbic dopamine system has been implicated in AUD, with both humans and rodents showing low levels of dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the striatum. We hypothesize that this decrease in striatal D2R availability is a critical mechanism underlying the stimulatory and anxiolytic responses, ultimately leading to compulsive-like drinking. Methods: To first identify the specific population of D2Rs involved in disordered ethanol consumption, we implemented genetically engineered mice lacking D2Rs on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum or D2 autoreceptors on midbrain dopamine neurons. To explore the rewarding and reinforcing aspects of ethanol in these transgenic mice, we examined intake parameters. With evidence of aberrant ethanol intake in mice selectively lacking D2Rs on striatal MSNs, we examined the acute stimulatory and sedative effects of ethanol in these mice; stimulatory effects were operationalized using ethanol-induced locomotion, while sedative effects were examined using the Loss of Righting Reflex (LORR) task. The anxiolytic effects of ethanol were examined in the transgenic mice and littermate controls using the elevated zero maze, light-dark box and open field.

Mice lacking striatal D2Rs also showed enhanced basal anxiety and a heightened anxiolytic response to ethanol. Thus, striatal D2Rs seem to be a common mechanism underlying both the acute stimulatory and anxiolytic responses to ethanol. However, we identified distinct circuitry underlying each behavior. We provide evidence of a mechanism in which low striatal D2Rs triggers D1R hypersensitivity, leading to a heightened acute stimulatory response to ethanol. However, this does not appear to be the mechanism by which D2Rs mediate the anxiolytic effects of ethanol, as a selective knockdown of dopamine D1Rs in the dorsal striatum attenuates the ethanolstimulatory response but not the anxiolytic response.",

The endocannabinoid (ECB) system and its cognate receptors (CB1R and CB2R) have previously been shown to interact with the opioid system to mediate the rewarding effect of MOR agonists such as oxycodone. Here we examined if acute exposure to the ECB agonist delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) results in a \"priming\" of hippocampal circuits for oxycodone associative learning. Methods: All experiments and procedures were approved by the Rockefeller University IACUC and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, 10 weeks old on arrival, n = 6/group) were group housed (2-3/cage) in a stress minimized animal facility with ad libitum access to food and water on a standard 12h:12h light cycle (lights on at 7a). Animals received either 5 mg/kg THC or vehicle (7.75% Tween20 in saline; i.p.) 1h prior to perfusion done with acrolein + paraformaldehyde. Dorsal hippocampal sections (n = 3/group) were then processed for dual label electron microscopy of DOR [silverintensified gold (SIG)] and GABA (ABC). Dendritic morphometry was determined using MCID. DOR-SIG particles were counted based on three locations [on plasmalemma, near plasmalemma (within one average particle distance away plasmalemma), or cytoplasmic]. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP.",

Following acute THC administration in females, THC reduced CA3 SR DOR densities potentially due to trafficking of cytoplasmic DOR to the plasma membrane to maintain synaptic DOR density. Conversely, following THC, DOR appears to be trafficked from CA3 mossy fiber spines to SR dendrites near the plasmalemma where they could enhance plasticity processes. This redistribution of hippocampal opioid receptors in THC injected-males suggesting that acute THC may \"prime\" males for opioid associative learning.

We chemogenetically activated VTA GABA terminals in the NAc of male rats (300 nL of 1\u03bcM of clozapine n-oxide, CNO), and compared this to saline pretreated and hM3D-free (mCherry) controls. For incubation of cocaine craving, a cohort of male rats (n = 17) were trained to selfadminister cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/inf) for 6 hours/day for 14 days, and then re-exposed to the operant chambers and cocaine-paired cues after early (1-3 days) and late (30-32 days) forced abstinence.

Background: There remains no FDA-approved medications for Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD). Glutamate-mediated synaptic plasticity changes within the mesocorticolimbic circuit contribute to hyper-responsiveness to drug-related cues that contribute to relapse. Moreover, glutamate is involved in regulating other behaviors associated with abstinence that are associated with relapse potential including anhedonia, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Receptor function and localization suggest that antagonism of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5) is a promising potential treatment for multiple aspects of CUD. mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) can attenuate cocaine self-administration (SA) and cue-or drug-induced increases in previously extinguished responses following SA (reinstatement model of relapse) in animals. However, full mGlu5 NAMs may also engender dose-limiting adverse effects. Partial mGlu5 NAMs block less than 100% of the effects assessed in vitro when compared to a full mGlu5 NAM, at concentrations that fully occupy the allosteric binding site on mGlu5. Partial mGlu5 NAMs, represented by M-5MPEP, may still produce positive effects in preclinical models of CUD without the adverse effects observed with full mGlu5 NAMs. Here, we describe studies comparing behavioral effects of the partial mGlu5 NAM M-5MPEP with the full mGlu5 NAM, VU0424238 in rodent models of CUD. Further, using electroencephalography (EEG) studies in freely moving rats, we are evaluating effects of these full and partial mGlu5 NAMs on sleep architecture and arousal alone, and to reverse cocaine-induced changes to understand doseeffect relationships between behavior and brain function. Examining effects of mGlu5 NAMs on cocaine-maintained behaviors and cocaine-induced brain changes will provide valuable insight into the pharmacotherapeutic potential of partial versus full mGlu5 NAMs for treating CUD. Methods: Male (n = 55) and female (n = 27) Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with indwelling intravenous catheters were used for behavioral studies. Rats were trained to lever press to SA 0.5 mg/kg/infusion of cocaine under a 5-response, fixed ratio (FR5) schedule, during daily 2-h sessions followed by 10 days of 6-hr extended access SA. Each SA session was paired with a vanilla odor cue and each infusion was paired with a 10-sec light cue presentation. Following extended access SA, responding was extinguished during daily 2-hr sessions in which saline was substituted for cocaine, the odor cue was absent, and the light cue was not presented following completion of each ratio. Once responding was reduced by \u226580% compared to the first day of extinction training, the light and odor cues were reintroduced in a single cue-induced reinstatement (CIR) test, followed 3 days later by a cocaine-induced reinstatement session (10 mg/kg, IP administered immediately prior to the session). To examine the ability of the mGlu5 NAMs to attenuate reinstatement, 18-56.6 mg/kg M-5MPEP, 3-30 mg/kg VU0424238 or vehicle (10% Tween 80) was administered (IP) 30 min prior to each reinstatement session. Following cue and cocaine-induced reinstatement tests, cocaine SA was continued under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. Lastly, rats responded under the same PR schedule when sucrose pellets were available as the reinforcer and effects of M-5MPEP and VU0424238 were evaluated.",

Background: The kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) that has dynorphin (DYN) as an endogenous ligand is an important regulator of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission implicated in motivation, emotion and executive function. Our laboratory and others have identified that alcohol dependence dysregulates DYN and the KOR in a manner that promotes multiple symptoms of dependence including escalated alcohol self-administration. Based on our assessment of Oprk1 (gene for the KOR) mRNA expression and DYN A-stimulated GTP\u03b3S data in non-dependent and alcohol dependent rats, neuroadaptations involving mesolimbocortical DA projections originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were implicated as a basis for escalated alcohol self-administration during acute withdrawal. Methods: We utilized transgenic TH::Cre rats that have Cre recombinase under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promotor in conjunction with a floxed Oprk1 viral construct to test the hypothesis that overexpression of Oprk1 in the VTA of male and female alcohol non-dependent TH::Cre rats would increase operant alcohol self-administration. Initial phenotyping of male and female TH::Cre rats for operant alcohol self-administration confirmed normal non-dependent alcohol self-administration (n = 7 / sex), as well as normal dependence-induced escalation of selfadministration (n = 7 / sex) during acute withdrawal following intermittent alcohol vapor exposure. Following optimization of viral infusions involving confirmation of VTA TH + immunostaining / viral EYFP overlap via fluorescent microscopy and, importantly, RT-qPCR confirmation of viral construct-induced increases in Oprk1 mRNA expression in the VTA of both male and female TH::Cre rats (n = 8 / sex), the effect of inducible overexpression of Oprk1 in non-dependent TH::Cre rats, conditionally in VTA DAergic neurons, on operant alcohol selfadministration was assessed. Male and female TH::Cre rats (n = 20 / sex) were trained for operant alcohol self-administration until stable responding during 30-min limited-access sessions was achieved, separated into groups (n = 10 / grp) matched for alcohol self-administration and site-specifically infused with an active floxed Oprk1 viral construct (AAV5-Ef1a-OPRK1-DIO-EYFP) or a control viral construct (AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-EYFP).

Background: Individually, both naltrexone and varenicline have shown to reduce alcohol intake in clinical trials, albeit with moderate effects. To advance medications development and harness the effects of combination pharmacotherapy, the present clinical trial tested the combination of varenicline (VAR, 2mg) and naltrexone (NTX, 50 mg) compared to varenicline plus matched placebo in a treatment-seeking sample of heavy drinking smokers. It was hypothesized that the combination pharmacotherapy would be superior to monotherapy in reducing alcohol consumption during the trial (NCT02698215). Methods: Treatment-seeking daily smokers (5 + cigarettes per day) who were also heavy drinkers (7/14 drinks per week for females, respectively) enrolled in the trial. Participants were required to express a desire to quit smoking and to reduce or quit drinking. A total of 450 individuals were screening for eligibility and 165 were randomized to either (1) VAR plus NTX or (2) VAR plus matched placebo. Participants were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 26 weeks post randomization. Active medication was provided for the initial 12 weeks. Initial analyses considered drinking days and drinks per drinking day at the 12week endpoint, controlling for baseline drinking.",

Background: Substance use disorders (SUDs) are characterized by the inability to stop reward-seeking behaviors despite maladaptive consequences. Indeed, prior history of cocaine leads to impaired behavioral flexibility in rats. We have previously shown that neural encoding in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and in the prelimbic cortex (PrL), during learning predicted subsequent behavioral flexibility in a reinforcer devaluation task (West and Carelli 2016). PrL sends dense, glutamatergic projections to the NAc core, and coherent activity across these regions, particularly at high gamma frequencies, during learning also predicts subsequent behavioral flexibility. In addition, specifically suppressing transmission in PrL-NAc core neurons during learning (using retrograde Cre virus in the NAc core and Cre-on halorhodopsin virus in the PrL) is sufficient to induce deficits in the ability to shift behavior post-devaluation. Finally, prior exposure to cocaine, followed by a month of experimentally imposed abstinence, suppresses coherent activity in the PrL-NAc core connection and induced deficits in flexibility compared to controls. Here, we used a reinforcer devaluation task following a history of cocaine to determine if optogenetic stimulation of the PrL-NAc core pathway is sufficient to reverse behavioral flexibility deficits following prior drug exposure. Methods: We used Long-Evans male rats (n = 14) and all experimental protocols in animal were approved by the IACUC at the University of North Carolina and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. First, we used a viral paradigm to transfect channelrhodopsin (ChR2 or mCherry) in PrL neurons that directly project to NAc core (retrograde Cre virus in NAc core and Cre-on ChR2 virus in the PrL). In a second surgery, 4 weeks later, we implanted optical ferrules into PrL and intrajugular catheters for i.v. administration. Rats (n = 8 ChR2 and n = 6 mCherry control) self-administered cocaine (cocaine (14 days; 2-hr self-administration; 0.33 mg/inf,~25 mg/kg), followed by 18 days of abstinence. High frequency (83Hz) blue laser was delivered via optical ferrules into the PrL for 3 days (10s on/10s off, 20 cycles/day; days 18-20 of abstinence) to excite the PrL-NAc core pathway. Next, rats underwent Pavlovian conditioning over 10 days. On each daily session, one conditioned stimulus (CS + 1) predicted food, while a different conditioned stimulus (CS + 2) predicted sugar, while two other stimuli did not predict anything (CS-1 and CS-2). Next rats underwent a conditioned taste aversion paradigm in which sugar pellets were paired with Lithium Chloride (0.3 M), while food pellets were paired with saline. Finally, on a post-devaluation test session, we measured the rats' ability to avoid the cue paired with sugar pellets (i.e., CS + 2) under extinction.",

In a proof-of-concept study of patients with depression (Linden et al. 2012) participants were able to upregulate the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and insula which significantly improved their clinical symptoms. Real time fMRI-NF has also enabled cocaine users to downregulate the ventral tegmental area, VTA (Kirschner et al., 2017) . In smokers, nicotine craving was reduced via downregulation of ventral anterior cingulate, vACC (Brady et al., 2015) . Social heavy alcohol drinkers have been able to downregulate their ventral striatum, VS, responses to alcohol cues (Kirsch et al., 2016) . Also, individuals with AUD modulated neural response to alcohol cues in anterior cingulate, ACC, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC, or anterior insula, AI, which corresponded to reduced craving (Karch et al., 2015) . We have piloted a multi-ROI approach in an effort to allow inter-subject variability not only in the localization of the modulated region but also the selection of regions themselves. Methods: Preliminary analysis was conducted in adult volunteers (13 controls and 8 AUD, 12 females) who completed a magnetic resonance imaging protocol. Four runs of rt-fMRI neurofeedback craving control training were conducted using the realtime plug-in for AFNI. For each run, baseline measures of craving and non-craving were assessed using a cue-reactivity test. Two cue types were used: food pictures for healthy control volunteers and alcohol pictures for participants with alcohol use disorder. BOLD fMRI data was processed in real-time using AFNI to measure and compute the signal change in each of the 5 pairs of ROIS: right and left VTA/substantia nigra (SN), AI, VS, dlPFC, and ACC/mPFC), which established the neurofeedback stimulus display. The stimuli display for rt-fMRI-NF consisted of craving cue images alongside a brain activity \"thermometer\". A composite index was calculated from the ROIs as part of the computation in real time to provide feedback to the participant on a 100 point \"thermometer\" scale.",

Background: Drug addiction is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by high relapse rates despite extended periods of abstinence and profound negative consequences. Preclinical models of drug self-administration and reinstated seeking demonstrate that dysfunctional glutamate transmission between the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) is directly linked to relapse. Specifically, cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking relies on increased extracellular glutamate in the NAcore. Recently, activation of nNOS interneurons has been shown to be critical for the induction of the synaptic plasticity in the NAcore mediating relapse. However, it has yet to be demonstrated that cue-induced cocaine seeking in rats elevates extracellular nitric oxide (NO).

Behaviorally, mice were tested on a food intake task in which they were allowed to freely consume sucrose pellets for one hour on two different test days. On one test day, mice were tested ad libitum (baseline motivation), and on the second, they were tested after 24hrs of food deprivation (enhanced motivation). MORs systems were modulated during each test session to determine whether they were necessary or sufficient for baseline or enhanced motivated states.",

FISH experiments showed that MORs are predominately expressed on dynorphin/D1 and enkephalin/D2 medium spiny neurons. To determine whether MORs preferentially act on one population, we crossed Oprm1fl/fl mice with dynorphin or enkephalin-cre mouse lines to selectively delete receptors from that particular cell type. We found that the loss of MORs on enkephalin, but not dynorphin, neurons resulted in decreased hunger-enhanced intake. To verify the NAc localization, we deleted MORs from NAc neurons via local viral microinjections. Surprisingly, we did not observe a decrease in hunger-enhanced intake. In contrast, retrograde deletion of MORs from neurons that project NAc resulted in reduced hunger-enhanced intake. Cumulatively, these results suggest that NAc MORs are on presynaptic enkephalinergic NAc afferents. Retroviral tracing in enkephalin-cre mice showed robust labeling in lateral dorsal raphe nucleus/ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (lDRN/vlPAG), indicating that this may be a site of interest. FISH analyses revealed that MORs were expressed on more than 50% of lDRN enkephalin neurons, that enkephalin and serotonin neurons are largely separate populations, and that enkephalin and vGAT are highly colocalized, indicating that the enkephalinergic projections to NAc are long range GABA projection neurons. To test the functionality of this pathway, we infused a cre-dependent MOR rescue virus directly into DRN of MOR knockout crossed with enkephalin-cre mice. We found that selective rescue of MORs was sufficient to restore hunger-enhanced intake. To further determine whether MORs were specifically acting on DRN-NAc terminals, we injected the calcium indicator GCaMP6s into DRN and placed a photometry optic fiber into NAc to measure changes in fluorescence during ad libitum or food deprived intake. Preliminary results show that DRN enkephalin terminals increase their activity as mice begin to eat, and peak as mice finish eating. During food deprived states, this increase is delayed. This delay may be related to MOR activity, as it can be prevented by preadministration of naloxone. To test the functional role of MORs on the terminal, we used the lightactivated opto-XR oMOR. Initial tests show that activation of oMOR on DRN-NAc terminals was sufficient to drive intake. Finally, we used of combination of DREADD inhibition/excitation, cell-type specific caspase deletion, and virally mediated peptidergic deletion of dynorphin or enkephalin to demonstrate that local NAc D2/enkephalin neurons use enkephalin to activate MORs on DRN-NAc terminals to increase food intake during food deprived states.",

In the United States, over 15.1 million adults aged 18 an older have an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Despite these concerning statistics and the availability of FDA-approved medication to treat AUD, few patients are treated with medications. In part, the reluctance of physicians to prescribe alcohol treatment medications and of patient to take them stem from the medications' limited efficacy. Thus, several medications have been prescribed off label and have shown promise in reducing alcohol consumption. Topiramate, a GABA/ glutamate modulator, has shown promise in reducing alcohol consumption. Both preclinical and clinical studies show that topiramate is effective in reducing heavy drinking. In the current study, we integrated genetic, neuroimaging, and pharmacological approaches to evaluate the potential therapeutic benefits of topiramate for reducing heavy drinking by examining topiramate's effects on heavy drinking and neural responses to alcohol cues. Methods: Twenty-two patients (13 topiramate, 9 placebo) participating in a larger, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled pharmacogenetic study (NCT02074904) completed two functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions (one prior to randomized, one following six weeks of study medication). Using linear mixed models, the primary model evaluated neural responses to alcohol cues compared to nonalcohol cues with a within-subject factor for time and between-subject factor for medication and the interaction (FWE-corrected at p < 0.05).",

Background: The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is important for regulating a number of behaviors, including alcohol and substance use. Promising clinical trials have shown that deep brain stimulation of the NAc decreases alcohol craving and relapse in alcohol dependent male subjects. Much of what we know about the NAc is based on studies carried out in males. We studied the effects of excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs in the NAc on bingelike drinking in female mice. We found that increasing activity specifically in the NAc core reduced binge-like drinking, and decreasing activity in the NAc core increased drinking in female C57BL/6J mice. Here, we investigated whether manipulating NAc core activity would produce similar results on binge drinking in male C57BL/6J mice. Methods: Mice were stereotaxically injected with AAV2 hSyn-HA hM3Dq (excitatory), -hM4Di (inhibitory), or -eGFP (negative control) bilaterally into NAc core and allowed to recover for 3 weeks. We first tested the effects of altering NAc activity on binge-like ethanol intake (\"Drinking in the Dark\", DID). We subsequently measured intake of sucrose, quinine, and water using a serial drinking in the dark (n = 11-15/group). Procedures were carried out as described in Purohit et al., 2018. During the first week of ethanol DID, mice were pre-treated with vehicle to establish baseline levels of DID intake, and in week 2, mice were treated with CNO (1 mg/kg) 15-30 minutes prior to DID to determine the effects of changing NAc core activity on drinking. Two weeks later, serial testing was carried out to measure the effects of CNO on intake of other fluids. Mice were treated with CNO (1 mg/kg) 15-30 minutes prior to being offered limited access to quinine (1st week), sucrose (2nd week), and water (3rd week; each solution was offered for 2 hour/day, 4 days/week).",

Background: Opioid Use disorder (OUD) is an epidemic in the United States and has led to a dramatic increase in opioiddependent mothers giving birth to neonates exhibiting opioid withdrawalreferred to as Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). NOWS is characterized by a set of hallmark features, including weight loss, irritability, inconsolability, insomnia, and increased pain sensitivity. The neurobiological basis of NOWS is largely unknown but is thought to comprise neurobiological adaptations that are distinct from opioid withdrawal exhibited in adolescence and adulthood. While several rat models for NOWS have been reported, there are very few NOWS models reported in mice. Because mice remain the premiere model organism for mammalian genetic studies, the development of NOWS models for mice will facilitate mechanistic and potentially treatment discovery. Methods: We treated neonatal outbred mice from the Cartworth Farms White (CFW; Swiss Webster stock) with either saline (SAL; 20 ml/kg; s.c.) or morphine sulfate (MOR; 15 mg/kg, s.c.) twice daily from postnatal day (P)1 through P14 which is the approximate third trimester-equivalent in humans. Weight loss was monitored and behavioral symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal were measured on P7 and P14 at 16 h post-MOR, including locomotor activity, ultrasonic vocalizations, sensitivity to the thermal nociception on the hot plate assay (52.5\u00b0C) and the tail withdrawal assay (48.5\u00b0C). Additionally, we assessed selfrighting as a developmental milestone on P4 and P7. A minimum sample size of n = 12 per Treatment was employed based on preliminary data in the hot plate assay indicating an effect size of Cohen's d = 1.4 which gave us 80% power to detect differences (p < 0.05). Behavioral data were analyzed using mixed-model ANOVAs with Treatment and Sex as factors and Day or Time as a repeated measure. Post-hoc t-tests were employed to detect the source of main effects and interactions and Bonferroni-adjusted pvalues were employed to report significant differences in behavior. Brainstem tissue from 12 mice (6 SAL, 6 MOR; sexbalanced) was collected 16 h post-final injection on P15 and processed for transcriptome analysis via mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) using oligo-dT-selected libraries, a single lane on a NovaSEQ6000 two-lane flow cell, and 100 bp single-end reads yielding an average of 37 million clusters per sample. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using limma and edgeR (p < 0.05). \"Sex\" was included as a covariate in the combined analysis. Additionally, females and males were analyzed separately. \"Family\" was always included as a covariate to account for variance across cages.

MOR females but not males showed a marked increase in USVs per min on P7 during the first 5 min of assessment. Furthermore, both MOR-treated sexes showed a profound increase in USVs per min on P14 relative to SAL mice, supporting a developmental delay. With regard to nociception, MOR mice exhibited thermal hyperalgesia at P7 and P14, with females showing greater sensitivity to hyperalgesia earlier on at P7. MOR mice also exhibited greater anxiety-like behavior at P21 as indicated by reduced locomotor activity and time spent in the center arena of the open field. For brainstem transcriptome analysis of the sex-collapsed data, enrichment analysis identified \"morphine addiction\" as the top pathway that included GABA-A receptor subunit genes (Gabra6, Gabrae), protein kinase C genes (Prkcg), adenylate cyclase 1 (Adcy1), and phosphodiesterase genes (Pde4c, Pde4d). Top downregulated genes included the methyltransferase gene Prdm6, the protocadherin gene Pcdha9, the protein kinase C gene Prkcg, Serpina3m, Chil3, S100a8, Krt25, Hoxc6, and Kremen2.

Background: Repeated experience with drugs of abuse like cocaine can induce lasting deficits in the function of motivationrelated neural circuits, and the resulting behavioral deficits from these neural disorders likely contribute to cycles of addiction and relapse. In rat models of drug-induced motivational impairments, we and others have repeatedly shown that cocaine selfadministration induces a variety of deficits in motivation-related signals in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). For example, neurons in the NAc core and shell fail to develop phasic neural responses to associative reward-paired cues over several days of learning, an observation that was coupled with these rats' inability to appropriately use learned motivational information in new settings. Likewise, cocaine-experienced rats displayed abnormal phasic dopamine release in the NAc to both associative cues and reward discrimination. However, it is not known the extent to which dopamine signaling deficits contribute to downstream miscoding in NAc target neurons. Indeed, multiple limbic targetsincluding the basolateral amygdala (BLA)appear to also be impaired following cocaine experience, and glutamatergic inputs from this region to the NAc may also significantly contribute to impairments in NAc motivational encoding. We hypothesized that stimulation of these impaired pathways to the NAc shell during associative learning could restore encoding and thus rescue motivated behavior. Methods: To test this, we injected channelrhodopsin (ChR2) into the VTA only (AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-ChR2-EYFP), BLA only (AAV5-CAMK2-ChR2-mCherry) or both VTA and BLA. An optrode (optical fiber surrounded by electrophysiological wires) was then implanted in the NAc shell to allow for stimulation of afferents and recording of NAc neural activity. TH::Cre and cre-negative littermate control rats in a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) task. Following two weeks of either cocaine (1 mg/kg/inf; 2hr/d) or water self-administration and period of abstinence (30d), rats then learned a Pavlovian discrimination where one food-paired cue (CS + ) was paired with optical stimulation (473nm light, 20mW, 20Hz), while a second cue (CS-) was presented without stimulation or food. Following this, rats then received instrumental training for several days on a variable interval schedule (up to VI60). On the PIT test day, rats were allowed to press under extinction and received presentations of the CS + and CS-. Following PIT test days, rats were given the opportunity to optically self-administer light to the NAc via an instrumental response for five consecutive 30min sessions.",

However, neither BLA-ChR2 stimulation nor BLA + VTA-ChR2 stimulation was effective at restoring PIT behavior. Consistent with this, we saw significantly restored phasic neural signals in the NAc shell of rats who received VTA-ChR2 stimulation, but not in BLA-ChR2 or BLA + VTA-ChR2. Finally, in the subsequent optical self-administration sessions, VTA-ChR2 rats vigorously self-administered light, but this was reduced in BLA + VTA-ChR2 rats and absent in BLA-ChR2 rats.",

Repeated cocaine experience increases and decreases, respectively, Homer2 protein expression within the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens of rodents and these cocaine-induced changes in Homer2 expression are functionally relevant for cocaine-induced changes in behavior. For example, relative to wild-type mice, Homer2 null mutant mice exhibit greater sensitivity to the locomotor-activating effects of acute cocaine, as well as a shift to the left in the dose-response function for cocaine-conditioned place-preference. Further, these phenotypes can be reversed by virus-mediated restoration of Homer2 expression within the nucleus accumbens. Recent studies indicate that Homer2 is phosphorylated on S117/S216 in response to neuronal activity and calcium-calmodulin kinase II alpha (CaMKII) activation. This phosphorylation causes a rapid dissociation of mGluR5-Homer2 binding. Interestingly, (S117/216)Homer2 is hyper-phosphorylated in the Frmr1 knock-out mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome, arguing a potentially important role for Homer2 phosphorylation in not only regulating behavioral sensitivity to cocaine, but also in gating normal sensorimotor, cognitive, emotional and motivational processing. Methods: To test this hypothesis, mice with alanine point mutations at S117/216 were generated and back-crossed to a C57BL/6J background. Subsets of mice were analyzed by immunoblotting for the effects of an acute injection of 20 mg/ kg cocaine upon Homer2 phosphorylation, CaMKII activation and mGlu5-Homer2 binding. Other subsets of mice were subjected to a behavioral test battery to examine for the effects of the phospho-mutation upon measures of negative affect (light-dark box, forced swim test, novel object test, elevated plus-maze), spatial learning and memory (Morris maze), sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle), and motor co-ordination (rotarod). A final subset of mice were assayed for cocaine-induced changes in behavior using a cocaine-induced place-conditioning regimen (4 pairings of either 3 or 30 mg/kg cocaine), coupled with locomotor activity monitoring.",

Brain transcriptomic changes of immune-related genes remain puzzling. To understand the role of immunologic changes to these disorders, we assessed gene expression changes related to neuroimmunogenic systems in post-mortem brain samples of individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive disorder (MDD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: We collected RNA-Seq data of 2,540 brain samples of the six major neuropsychiatric disorders, and processed them using a unified process including quality control, filter and removing known and unknown confounding variables. We used the linear-mixed model to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs), focusing on a curated list of 1,256 immune-related genes (IRGs) collected from databases. We used FDR < 0.05 to define significant changes. We further performed Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), placing the 1,256 genes into each coexpression modules, and identified differentially expression modules (DEMs) enriched with the IRGs.

Despite significant heritability of suicide, genetic discovery efforts for the extreme phenotype of suicide death have been virtually nonexistent as no sizable cohorts have been available for study. Methods: We conducted a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of suicide death, with 3,413 male and female population-ascertained cases of European ancestry and 14,810 matched controls. Case samples were obtained from the Utah Office of the Medical Examiner and matched control cohorts were provided by Generation Scotland and UK10k collaborators. Genomic data were handled using PLINK. SNPs with ambiguous strand orientation, > 5% missing calls, or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p < 0.001 were excluded. SNPs with minor allele frequency below 0.01 or imputation R2 < 0.5 were also excluded. Final analysis was performed on 7,519,308 imputed variants passing quality control. A Linear Mixed Model (LMM) algorithm tested variant association with suicide death, with follow-up examination of significant hits for linkage disequilibrium and gene set enrichment. GWAS were performed using GEMMA, a computationally efficient and open-source LMM algorithm for GWAS that models population stratification remaining after PCA by use of genomic relatedness matrices. PRS for suicide death was derived using PRSice 2.0 and summary statistics from a 10-fold cross validation procedure to avoid overfitting. Using summary statistics from the GWAS, we then cross-validated prediction of case-control status, accounting for ancestry, across independent training and test sets using polygenic risk scores for suicide death. We then leveraged genome-wide data and medical record (EHR) data on all suicide cases to examine 1) case-control differences in polygenic risks for 35 other psychiatric and medical phenotypes, and 2) mode of death associations with all polygenic risks and with all psychiatric and medical ICD codes.

We suggest that downstream \u03b2adrenoceptor activation by nicotine in the context of the high arousal created by the RVIPT may have limited performanceenhancing effects of nicotine via other mechanisms, which were unmasked by \u03b2 antagonism. Propranolol also benefited performance of an unspeeded short-term memory task, which was always completed last. Effects of propranolol on mood states, including enhanced vigor and reduced testing-induced tension, are consistent with an overall beneficial effects profile of propranolol on cognition, especially on the maintenance of performance ability with prolonged testing. In contrast, in a rodent paradigm of attention that requires behavioral activation, propranolol had impaired performance and antagonized performance-enhancing effects of nicotine, implying benefit from greater \u03b2-adrenoceptor tone. The present results suggest poor translatability of drug effects from rodent paradigms of cognition, which depend on behavioral activation, to human paradigms, which depend on keeping behavioral activation at bay while dealing with sustained processing demands.",

To increase treatment relevance, we test the generalizability of our results comparing data across two independent samples. Methods: We analyzed two samples, one (N = 184) primarily containing youth referred for treatment for emotional problems and another (N = 328) primarily comprised of youth referred for treatment for behavior problems. In both samples, symptoms of irritability, anxiety and disruptive behavior were measured with the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI), the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) and the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder subscale from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), respectively. Further, all participants had 10 minutes of restingstate functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data. Functional connectivity was assessed using partial correlations between the 200 parcels (here network nodes) of a common cortical parcellation scheme, plus 16 subcortical structures. Partial correlations offer an estimate of direct (as opposed to indirect or shared) connectivity between each pair of nodes. PCA was used for dimensionality reduction such that only the 20 principal components that represented the largest amount of betweensubject variance among the network edges and among the clinical variables were retained.

For the fMRI data, pseudo-resting time series (e.g., Sheffield 2016) were created for each participant from four task-based functional scans, all with the same acquisition parameters (TR=2.0s, TE=28ms, flip angle 90deg, 3.75x3.75x6 mm voxels, 26:08 total minutes of scanning). Functional scans were co-registered, motioncorrected, and normalized to MNI space. Data were concatenated, bandpass filtered, spatially smoothed (6mm FWHM), and effects of no interest were regressed out (including those related to motion and task design). Multivariate-Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR; Shehzad 2014) was used to identify voxels where whole-brain network connectivity associated with NeanderScore, controlling for age, sex and ancestry-related genetic components at p = 0.005. Follow-up voxel-wise analysis using the results from the MDMR analysis as a seed region were carried out to clarify the underlying functional connectivity patterns driving the association.",

In addition to skull and brain shape, we now show that the whole-brain functional connectivity patterns of the IPS are related to degree of Neanderthal ancestry in living humans. This IPS region is remarkably similar to the left IPS region identified in our previous report relating NeanderScore to skull shape and brain structure. The IPS is known to be a hub for visuospatial processing and the directionality of these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that Neanderthal brains had greater resources devoted to visual networks at the expense of social networks (Pearce 2018). Our results further support the contention that that Neanderthal-derived genetic variation is functional in the human brain, potentially influencing an evolutionary balance between visuospatial and social functioning.",

One important component of social functioning is the ability to recognize and respond to the emotional content of faces. Face emotion recognition (FER) depends upon low-level and higher-level cognitive processes and, in the visual system, upon coordinated functioning of subcortical and cortical regions including the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, for processing of both static and moving facial features. Impaired FER has been reported numerous times in SZ and ASD and, in both cases, linked to atypical neuronal activity within visual cortex. Despite overlaps, however, only a few studies to date have directly explored convergent and divergent neural mechanisms of visual processing in ASD and SZ. In this study we used fMRI and task-based functional connectivity to evaluate impaired FER in relation to activation of subcortical and cortical visual regions. Methods: Participants were 20 high-functioning adults with ASD (mean age 29 years), 28 patients diagnosed with SZ (mean age 37 years) and 30 neurotypical control (NT) volunteers (mean age 34 years). Psychiatric symptoms in SZ were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. ASD diagnosis was ascertained based on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. FER was evaluated using both static and dynamic faces. Dynamic FER utilized brief video clips of faces dynamically expressing unique emotions selected from the University of Cambridge Mind Reading Emotions Library. Single frames that best represented the emotion were extracted from each video and used as corresponding static stimuli. The cortical and subcortical neural correlates of impaired FER in SZ and ASD were explored with functional MRI during passive viewing of the dynamic and static emotional faces. Functional connectivity analyses (psychophysiological interactions) were used to estimate the functional coupling between face-emotion sensitive brain regions.",

                "text": "Background: Poor inhibitory control is a risk factor for drug and alcohol use disorders. Evidence from both animal and human studies suggests that this increased risk could be due in part to greater sensitivity to drug reinforcement. In line with this, we recently showed that individuals with poor inhibitory control and less right frontal brain engagement during motor inhibition report greater euphoria and stimulation following a single dose of amphetamine. Here we tested the degree to which these findings generalize to another drug of abuse, alcohol.Methods: In the behavioral phase of the study, participants (n = 69 men and women) performed the stop signal task, a behavioral measure of inhibitory control, and then participated in four experimental sessions in which they received alcohol (0.8 g/kg, oral) or placebo, in alternating order. They completed the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale to assess alcohol-induced stimulation and sedation at 30-minute intervals over 2.5 hours. Then in the imaging phase, subjects completed an fMRI scan to assess neural correlates of inhibitory control using the same stop signal task, adapted for use during fMRI.Results: In the behavioral phase, linear mixed effects models showed that longer stop signal reaction time (indicating poor inhibitory control) was associated with greater stimulation (t = 2.19, p = 0.029) and less sedation (t = 2.55, p = 0.011) following alcohol compared to placebo. In the fMRI phase, correlational analyses showed that less brain engagement in the right middle frontal gyrus during response inhibition [stop > go] was associated with greater stimulation following alcohol (r = \u22120.255, p = 0.037). Additionally, less brain engagement in the supplementary motor area during inhibition was associated with less sedation following alcohol (r = 0.298, p = 0.014).Conclusions: These findings show that poor inhibitory control at the behavioral level and reduced pre-frontal and pre-motor engagement during inhibition at the neural level are associated with a risky alcohol response profile (i.e., greater positive, stimulant-like effects of alcohol and less negative sedative-like effects). This extends our previous findings showing a similar association between poor inhibitory control and less right frontal brain engagement during inhibition and greater sensitivity to amphetamine reward. Together, the findings show that inhibition and reward are closely linked. Further, they provide novel behavioral and neural targets for prevention and treatment of substance use disorders aimed at simultaneously improving inhibitory control and dampening subjective responses to drugs of abuse.Keywords: Alcohol, Brain Imaging, fMRI, Inhibitory Control Disclosure: Nothing to disclose. Background: Several peptides which modulate food intake and satiety also regulate behavioral responses to drugs of abuse. One of these is glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Preclinical studies show that synthetic analogs of GLP-1 (i.e., exendin -4) decrease cocaine self-administration, reinstatement of cocaine seeking, and cocaine-induced reward. In addition, clinical studies demonstrated their capacity to facilitate weight loss. However, the mechanism of action underlying such effects on food intake/drug reward is not well understood. One possibility is that GLP-1 may mediate its effects, in whole or in part, through actions on other peptides, including insulin and amylin (i.e., GLP-1 promotes insulin release and insulin is co-secreted with amylin). Preclinical studies on the relationship between cocaine administration and plasma levels of these hormones have been mixed. Clinical studies showed that a single intravenous (IV) injection of cocaine reduced both GLP-1 and insulin levels (and trend reductions were observed for amylin as well). However; to date, no studies have examined the effects of binge self-administration of cocaine. The current study explored relationships between selfadministered cocaine, treatment with the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide, and plasma levels of GLP-1, Insulin, and Amylin.Methods: Subjects with Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD) underwent three inpatient human laboratory sessions using a cocaine selfadministration paradigm that included a single training/habituation session and two experimental sessions following acute pretreatment with exenatide (5 mcg) and placebo (in randomized order). Each experimental session began with a drug-drug interaction (DDI) phase consisting of 3 serial, fixed-order, nurse initiated bolus cocaine injections (4, 8, 16 mg/70kg) followed by 1.5 hours of ad libitum self-administered intravenous (IV) boluses (16 mg/70 kg) of cocaine according to a fixed-ratio 1 schedule. Outcomes consisted of plasma levels of GLP-1, insulin, and amylin at baseline (T1), after the first bolus of cocaine (T2), and at the end of ad libitum cocaine self-administration (T3). Peptide levels were analyzed with commercially-available ELISA kits and statistical analyses were performed with SAS using mixed models testing for treatment effect (i.e., exenatide vs. placebo) and time effect (i.e., T1 vs. T2. Vs. T3).Results: Of the 13 individuals who enrolled in the study, data was collected from 12 (1 female, 10 African American (AA), 1 White Hispanic (WH); 45 \u00b1 7 yrs). Significant effects of treatment were observed for GLP-1 (Den DF = 55, F = 4.65, P = 0.03) and insulin (Den DF = 55, F = 5.69, P = 0.02) levels, which were lower following exenatide as compared to placebo. A significant effect of time was also found for GLP-1 (Den DF = 55, F = 18.43, P <0.0001), insulin (Den DF = 55, F = 18.43, P <0.0001), and amylin (Den DF = 50, F = 14.82, P < 0.0001), in which levels were lower after cocaine administration.Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first human study to examine the effects of exenatide on binge cocaine-induced changes in GLP-1, insulin, and amylin levels. Results show that exenatide and binge cocaine independently reduce levels of GLP-1 and insulin and that binge cocaine also reduces amylin levels. These results expand our knowledge about how cocaine affects peripheral metabolic hormones using a naturalistic pattern of binge self-administration. Future work is required to understand how amylin/insulin and/or their interactions with GLP-1 are involved in the neurobiology of drug intake.Keywords: Cocaine, GLP-1, Amylin, Insulin Disclosure: Nothing to disclose. Background: Sign-tracking is a form of Pavlovian conditioned approach to reward-associated cues. Sign-tracking is often contrasted with goal-tracking, which is cue-triggered approach directed toward the location of reward delivery. Interest in sign-tracking has increased in recent years because individual variation in sign-tracking has been shown to predict addiction-like behaviors in animals. Though signtracking has been observed in a wide variety of species, including rodents, primates, fish, cephalopods, and insects, there have been very few attempts to document sign-tracking in humans.Methods: So far 36 healthy men and women aged 18-25 have been recruited for this study. We directly translated a rat PCA task for human subjects, using a retractable lever as a conditioned stimulus that predicts reward delivery into a different physical location (reward magazine). Physical contacts as well as eye-gaze directed toward the lever or magazine were recorded as outcome measures. Subjects also completed questionnaire-based measurements of trait impulsivity.Results: There was significant inter-individual variation in the extent to which subjects interacted with the \"sign\" (lever) or the \"goal\" (magazine) during lever presentation. Overall responses were skewed toward sign-tracking, with 58% of subjects primarily sign-tracking, 28% primarily goal-tracking, and 14% equally engaging in both behaviors. Analysis of impulsivity revealed a negative correlation between motor impulsivity and goal-tracking behavior (r = 0.35, p = 0.032).Conclusions: These experiments demonstrate that sign-and goal-tracking behavior can be measured in humans. Furthermore, inter-individual variation in goal-tracking behavior appears to correlate with motor impulsivity, which is a known risk factor for addiction and other psychiatric disorders.Keywords Background: Social isolation (SI) is a risk factor for multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Although SI during all portions of the lifespan is detrimental to health, SI during childhood and adolescence is particularly disruptive due to the concurrent neurodevelopmental processes occurring during this time period. Unfortunately, SI during adolescence is increasing and this increase is thought to contribute to the rising rates of psychiatric disorders in this age group. SI interacts with genetic and other environmental risk factors to induce many neurobiological changes that exert long-term effects on behavior. In this study, we found significant changes in reward-seeking behavior in male mice exposed to post-weaning SI. These data suggest that changes in reward-seeking behavior may contribute to the neuropsychiatric risk associated with SI. Methods: Mice (C57BL/6J) were weaned on postnatal day 21 (PD21) and separated into group-housed (GH) or SI cohorts. GH mice were housed in cages of three mice for the entire experiment. SI mice were singly-housed from PD21 to PD35. On PD35, SI mice were paired with previously isolated littermates and pair-housed for the remainder of the experiments. Behavioral testing began at PD63. All mice were trained on touchscreenbased fixed and progressive ratio operant tasks that utilized strawberry milk as the reinforcer. We tested the effect of SI on performance on FR1, FR5, and PR4 schedules of reinforcement. For these experiments, we started with nine GH male mice and twelve SI male mice. One SI mouse was removed from the study because it did not complete all of the test sessions. We analyzed total rewards received on the FR schedules and breakpoint on the PR4 schedule using unpaired t-tests. The PR breakpoint was defined as the last ratio completed in the session.

Omar Maximo, Nina Kraguljac, Eric Nelson, William Armstrong University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United StatesBackground: Meta-analyses have consistently identified an association between the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), the duration between the onset of positive symptoms and treatment, and clinical outcomes. Active psychosis might adversely affect the brain, and several mechanisms have been proposed, such as NMDA receptor hypofunction or increased dopaminergic activity. The DUP also implicates a process by which antipsychotic drug (APD) treatment attenuates the pathophysiological process underlying the DUP. The goal of this longitudinal multimodal imaging study was to examine the relationship between the DUP and the resting state functional connectivity and cortical morphology of three major neuronal networks[default mode (DMN), salience (SN), and central executive (CEN)] in antipsychotic-na\u00efve first episode psychosis patients (AN-FEP), as well as to evaluate their contribution to eventual treatment response following APD treatment. Methods: Scans were obtained prior to treatment and after weeks of APD treatment in 55 AN-FEP. Resting state (TR = 1550ms; TE = 37.80ms; flip angle = 71\u00b0, FOV = 104mm2; voxel size= 2mm3; 225 volumes, and 72 axial slices) and T1-weighted structural (MPRAGE: TR = 2400ms; TE = 2.22ms; inversion time = 1000ms; flip angle = 8\u00b0; voxel size = 0.8mm3) scans were acquired. The CONN toolbox and Freesurfer were used to process and analyze resting state functional connectivity data and structural images, respectively. Resting state signal from a priori brain regions of interest from posterior cingulate cortex (DMN), right insula) (SN)",

A substantial proportion of psychiatric inpatients are re-admitted after discharge. Readmissions are disruptive for patients and families and are a key driver of rising healthcare costs. Reducing readmission risk is therefore a major unmet need of psychiatric care. Electronic health records (EHRs) contain detailed descriptions about a patient's illness presentation, prior course, and treatment plansall vital information for identifying readmission risk.

Lacking effective and well-established treatment strategies for these severe affected patients in-and outpatient care remains challenging for both patients and the health system. Therefore, novel research focuses are needed. Biomarkers reliably reflecting neuropathological processes could help to understand the actual mechanisms in treatment resistance leading to innovative and more effective treatment options. Due to novel imaging techniques and new ways of neuromodulatory interventions mood disorders are commonly regarded as dysfunctions of neural networks. One important substrate of neural networks is obviously the axon. There is evidence that major depressive disorder (MDD) might be associated with axonal damage. For a short time only one is able to detect correlates of axonal damage in plasma via the specific biomarker neurofilament light protein.Neurofilament light protein is an abundant part of the axonal cytoskeleton and can be released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following axonal damage. Recent technological advancements enable its determination in very low concentrations not only in cerebrospinal fluid but also in plasma. Plasma levels of neurofilament light protein have already been discussed as a reliable biomarker of neuroaxonal damage in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Due to accumulating evidence that major depression is associated with axonal damage, treatment resistance in major depression may be correlated with lasting axonal damage within circuits processing affective responses. This axonal damage could be reflected by increased plasma levels of neurofilament light protein.Methods: To evaluate our hypothesis we obtain plasma samples of 32 patients with severe treatment resistant major depression participating in an efficacy study of deep brain stimulation of the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle (slMFB) -FORESEE III (Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial to assess Efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the slMFB in Patients with Treatment Resistant Major Depression).

                "text": "An unresolved issue is whether addiction is a brain disorder that is associated with pervasive neurobiological changes or a psychological failure that is associated with preserved brain function. A central feature of brain disorders, including dementia and traumatic brain injury, is a change in brain structure and function, including a decrease in modular functional architecture of the brain. However, it is currently unclear whether or not abstinence from alcohol dependence produces widespread changes to brain structure and organization. Furthermore, identification and quantification of the neuronal networks that are activated during alcohol abstinence is a critical step in the understanding of alcohol use disorder. Several brain regions have been identified as being recruited during withdrawal from alcohol drinking, however, previous work used manual cell counting and often a priori selection of region of interests, biasing and dramatically limiting the number of brain regions analyzed. These issues can be addressed in a preclinical model of alcohol use disorder using novel techniques for whole brain imaging (iDISCO + ) and graph theory to analyze network properties. Overall the goal of this study was to identify changes in neuronal structure.",

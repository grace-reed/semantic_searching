Our knowledge base and ability to understand and manage these phenomena have expanded greatly in the past several decades. Consequently, there are many excellent books and papers that review this progress (e.g., Hallegraeff 1993 .

Given the diversity of HABs and their impacts, it was difficult to perceive trends in incidence-regionally, nationally, or globally. The first syntheses to provide a global perspective on HAB trends were by Anderson (1989) and Hallegraeff (1993) , who argued that there had been a global increase in the frequency, magnitude, and geographic extent of HAB events over the preceding two decades. There were multiple reasons proposed for this expansion, including natural dispersal of species by currents and storms, dispersal through human activities such as ballast water discharge and shellfish translocation, improved detection of HABs and their toxins due to better chemical instrumentation and improved communication among scientists, increased aquaculture operations in coastal waters, and stimulation of HABs as a result of cultural eutrophication or perhaps even climate change.",

Arguments and disagreements arise, however, over the reasons for the expansion in particular regions, or whether there has been any increase at all or even a decrease in other areas. It is far too easy to extrapolate from one region to another without adequate scientific justification, or to infer a trend without sufficient long-term data. With the benefit of hindsight we can highlight regional cases where expansion has occurred and probable mechanisms can be identified. One example of a HAB expansion caused by storms or other natural events is in the Gulf of Maine, United States, where in 1972 a major tropical storm stimulated and dispersed a large Alexandrium red tide throughout the region. This led to the deposition of dormant cysts in waters that had virtually no history of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), but that have had annual outbreaks nearly every year thereafter ). An example of ship ballast water-mediated range expansion is the introduction of the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum into Tasmania in the mid-1970s (see review of molecular, plankton, and cyst evidence in Bolch & de Salas 2007) , from where it has since dispersed to mainland Australia.",

Some argue that for the sake of stability of nomenclature, conservative morphological traits must remain the gold standard for traditional species classification, and if genetic differences cannot be linked to differences in morphology, we cannot speak of different species. Others contend that genetic differences are sufficient to separate species, even when these assignments differ from those that would be made on the basis of morphology.

Ribotyping and application of conservative single-gene markers such as rDNA have been valuable in resolving taxonomic and phylogenetic issues among HAB species, but revealing cryptic diversity at the intraspecific and population levels requires finer discrimination. For example, molecular sequencing of strains in culture revealed that the widely reported cosmopolitan coastal diatom Skeletonema costatum includes five distinct morphotaxa, at least some of which have discrete regional distributions and distinct ecophysiological characteristics (Kooistra et al. 2008) . The dinoflagellate genera Gymnodinium and Gyrodinium were initially separated morphologically on the basis of girdle displacement; with support from a new molecular phylogeny, these genera were redefined on the basis of the shape of the apical groove, allowing for the creation of the family Kareniaceae for the fucoxanthin-containing, fish-killing dinoflagellate genera Karenia (10+ spp. now known), Karlodinium (8 spp.), and Takayama (6 spp.) (Daugbjerg et al. 2000 , de Salas et al. 2008 . This combination of improvements in morphotaxonomy coupled with the development of molecular probes (see below) also led to the new recognition that what were thought to be monospecific Karenia brevis red tides in Florida are in fact often multispecies blooms (Steidinger et al. 2008) .

Morphospecies designations, therefore, can sometimes be of limited use for ecological purposes. The dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense is known to exist as toxic and nontoxic strains, bioluminescent and nonbioluminescent populations, and cold-water and warm-water forms. Furthermore, rRNA sequences of isolates of the A. tamarense species complex clustered more logically on the basis of geographic origin than morphotaxonomy (Scholin & Anderson 1994 , Scholin et al. 1995 ; Figure 3 ). Morphologically indistinguishable populations thus can hide cryptic genotypes, some of which are consistently toxic whereas others (European and Tasmanian ribotypes, now termed Groups III and V; Lilly et al. 2007) are mostly nontoxic. In such cases it is critical that molecular probes used in shellfish and phytoplankton monitoring programs discriminate between ribotypes rather than simply morphospecies. On the basis of rRNA studies the appearance of the temperate Asian (Group IV) ribotype of A. tamarense in 1983 in the Mediterranean could only be explained by human-assisted introduction (Lilly et al. 2002) . However, when Masseret et al. (2009) examined these same strains using hypervariable microsatellite markers this revealed relationships that were not apparent from rRNA sequences studies on the same group. Mediterranean populations were shown to be a distinct lineage, and therefore other origins must now be explored.",

This approach has been successfully applied to elucidate the comparative structure and function of gene clusters for the toxin analogs of saxitoxins and microcystins of toxigenic HAB-forming cyanobacteria, such as Raphidiopsis brookii and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Stucken et al. 2010) , with genome sizes of <4 Mb. The much larger size of the nuclear genomes of eukaryotic microalgae has severely restricted the whole-genome sequencing approach-there is only one published fully sequenced and annotated closed genome for a HAB species, that of the brown tide species Aureococcus anophagefferens (Gobler et al. 2011) . This paucity of whole genomes for HAB taxa is being addressed, albeit not systematically. A draft genome (300 Mb) has been generated for the toxigenic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries (Armbrust 2009) , which produces the neurotoxin domoic acid, and the expected partial annotation is expected to yield insights into pathways of toxigenesis and iron acquisition relevant to bloom dynamics. Nevertheless, most toxigenic HAB taxa belong to the dinoflagellates, a group that has proven to be particularly intractable with respect to genomic analysis. The dinoflagellate nuclear genome is typically large-often >250 Gb, and in the case of Alexandrium, more than 40 times the size of the human genome! This size poses an impediment to whole-genome sequencing, even with the implementation of massively parallel high-throughput (Roche 454) pyrosequencing technology. Further complexities and peculiarities of the dinoflagellate genome-permanently condensed chromatin, general lack of histones, frequent base-pair substitution, high G-C base-pair ratio-compound the genome sequencing problem.",

The transcriptome comprises all of the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts expressed within a given time frame, and therefore can provide dynamic insights into shifts in gene expression relevant to mechanisms such as toxin biosynthesis or bloom growth kinetics. Several HAB taxa have been recently subjected to analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), each of which is a short subsequence of a transcribed complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence. Although the EST analysis is restricted by the fact that only a fraction of the transcribed genome is surveyed, and then only when the corresponding mRNA is expressed, this approach has been effectively used to identify gene transcripts, discover new genes, and determine sequence homology for various HAB taxa. EST databases are now extensive and representative of a wide diversity of organisms, including the HAB species Alexandrium fundyense (Hackett et al. 2005) , A. catenella (Uribe et al. 2008) , A. ostenfeldii ( Jaeckisch et al. 2008) , A. minutum (Yang et al. 2010) , Karenia brevis (Lidie et al. 2005) , Chrysochromulina polylepis , and Prymnesium parvum (La Claire 2006) , with more in the pipeline awaiting further annotation and verification.",

Historically, the discovery of these phycotoxins proceeded from cases of human illness of unknown etiology, often linked to consumption of contaminated seafood. This was followed by bioassay-guided isolation, usually with reference to a mammalian model such as the laboratory mouse. This led inevitably to the naming of phycotoxin-associated syndromes according to the toxin vector and characteristic symptoms elicited in humans-amnesic shellfish poisoning, ciguatera fish poisoning, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning, and azaspiracid shellfish poisoning.",

Rapid advances in mass spectrometry have improved sensitivity by several orders of magnitude, such that it is now possible to quantitatively detect many phycotoxins directly from the water column during or subsequent to blooms at a detection limit of one or a few toxic cell equivalents. Creative methods development in mass spectrometry now provides the opportunity for simultaneous broad-spectrum screening for a host of ion masses from multiple structural groups of toxins in a single extraction (Quilliam 2003 , Hiller et al. 2007 . A major drawback of mass spectrometry-namely, the requirement for laboratory operation-has now been somewhat alleviated following successful onboard LC-MS/MS analysis of phycotoxins of freshly harvested plankton from the water column, providing near-real-time toxin profiles during an oceanographic cruise (Krock et al. 2009) .",

Since the structural elucidation of the first known phycotoxin (the tetrahydropurine neurotoxin saxitoxin) and the rediscovery of domoic acid as a phycotoxin, literally hundreds of phycotoxin analogs have been found in plankton, seawater, and seafood matrices, belonging to >20 structural groups. Nevertheless, it has been more than a decade since the characterization of an entirely new major group of phycotoxins associated with acute human toxicity, the azaspiracids ( James et al. 2003) . It does appear that the golden age of discovery of new classes of marine phycotoxins causing as yet unidentified human toxin syndromes may be behind us, although recent evidence suggests that in freshwater habitats, new groups of toxins, perhaps associated with toxigenic cyanobacteria, await discovery. This is not to denigrate the importance of discoveries of new microalgal species or populations associated with known toxins, or the reevaluation of the toxigenicity of relatively well-characterized species. Based upon structural arguments and similarities to other cyclic imine toxins (spirolides and gymnodimine), it has long been suspected that pinnatoxins, known previously only from shellfish, originated from toxic dinoflagellates. The recent association of a benthic peridinoid dinoflagellate from New Zealand, Vulcanodinium rugosum, with production of pinnatoxins E and F has now confirmed this link (Rhodes et al. 2010 , N\u00e9zan & Chom\u00e9rat 2011 .",

This work on clonal cultures obtained by serial dilution of mixed field plankton populations from the North Sea served to overturn the prior association, also supported by LC-MS/MS, of azaspiracid toxins with the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Protoperidinium crassipes as source organism ( James et al. 2003) .

Analysis of spirolide toxin profiles from natural populations and isolates of Alexandrium ostenfeldii from the Gulf of Maine (United States and Canada) revealed not only the regional diversity among populations but also the presence of five distinct toxin phenotypes among isolates (Gribble et al. 2005) . This example merely illustrates the fact that biosynthesis of particular toxin analogs is subject to inter-and intraspecific variation, including at the population level and even in some cases among clones within a population. Furthermore, in general, recent studies have supported the concept that the distribution of phycotoxins is not only patchy in a biogeographical sense, but also that phycotoxins are subject to biotransformation as well as selective uptake and elimination kinetics within components of the food web.

Research groups seldom work with identical algal culture strains, however, or with identical bioassay systems for fish toxicity-i.e., they have often used different fish strains or species, different ages of fish (juveniles or adults), and varying exposure times. Brine shrimp assays or mammalian hematocyte assays are not good model systems for fish gills. An important recent breakthrough has been the development of a standard fish gill bioassay system, which has been adapted for use with living algal cultures and lends itself to automation in a plate reader system measuring cell viability indicator dyes (Dorantes-Aranda et al. 2011) . It now is becoming clear that algal cells must rupture for significant ichthyotoxicity to occur, that some PUFAs-such as EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), but not OPA (octadecapentaenoic acid) or OTA (octadecatetraenoic acid)-can cause significant gill damage, and that ROS sometimes may be involved in the generation of highly toxic lipid peroxidation products (Marshall et al. 2003 , Mooney et al. 2011 . Hopefully, improved understanding of HAB fish-killing mechanisms may aid in the design of effective mitigation strategies.",

The expression of \"toxic\" allelochemical activity by multiple clones of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense against the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina and the predatory dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina, including loss of mobility and cell lysis, was shown to be unrelated to the PSP toxin content or composition of the Alexandrium isolate (Alpermann et al. 2010) . Preliminary characterization of the lytic toxins from A. tamarense (Ma et al. 2010) indicated that these compounds are macromolecular or large aggregates (>5 kDa), and further analysis indicated that they are neither proteinaceous nor primarily polysaccharide derived. Tillmann et al. (2008) demonstrated that six species of Alexandrium produce lytic substances and other allelochemicals capable of immobilizing and lysing a variety of protist species. The exact chemical nature of the compounds involved remains to be determined, as does their ecological role, but they are distinct from the known phycotoxins and thus can cause broad-based trophodynamic effects. They may be involved in food or nutrient acquisition and feeding, as is well established for the mixotrophic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum, which releases lytic compounds that immobilize or kill motile prey before ingestion (Skovgaard & Hansen 2003) .",

The karlotoxin-producing dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum provides perhaps the best-described current model of the mode of action of allelochemical activity associated with a rather well-defined group of toxins. Adolf et al. (2007) showed that grazer susceptibility to membrane lysis by karlotoxins was due to the corresponding sterol composition of the potential predators-those containing predominantly desmethyl sterols are susceptible and those with mainly 4\u03b1-methyl sterols are resistant. The mode of action of karlotoxins by membrane pore formation may also account for the known ichthyotoxicity of Karlodinium spp., in addition to contributing to the success of in situ blooms against competitors and predators.",

Fish and zooplankton avoid dense concentrations of certain HAB species, and laboratory studies indicate that some HAB species are rejected by at least some predators or grazers either by preingestive selection or after ingestion of a threshold dosage of toxic cells . A breakdown of grazing control has been implicated in the brown tides in Narragansett Bay and in Texas, and removal or loss of the grazer population has been reported to precede or accompany bloom development (Montagna et al. 1993 ). To date, however, evidence that some HAB species are toxic to their potential grazers, such as copepods, is equivocal (Turner 2006) . Whereas some authors reported preingestive rejection of toxic Alexandrium strains by copepods (Huntley et al. 1986) , others found that some copepods were unaffected and fed at high rates on both toxic and nontoxic Alexandrium cells (Teegarden & Cembella 1996) . The extent to which any of the above biological interactions occur in natural waters and affect HAB dynamics and toxicity is not well known, and represents an important line of inquiry that underpins our quest to understand the ecological basis for HAB toxin and allelochemical production.",

In such cases, the population increases can be significant and alarming, but should not be attributed to in situ growth. Still other HABs are initiated from resting cysts that germinate from bottom sediments, significantly impacting many aspects of HAB phenomena (Garc\u00e9s et al. 2010) . Cyst or spore germination provides the inoculum for blooms, and the transformation back to the resting state can remove substantial numbers of vegetative cells from the population and act as a major factor in bloom decline. Cysts are also important for population dispersal; they permit a species to survive through adverse conditions, and since sexuality is typically required for their formation, they facilitate genetic recombination (Masseret et al. 2009) .

Cyst abundance has been mapped and quantified for a number of years, exhibiting considerable interannual variability. A strong relationship has been demonstrated between the abundance of cysts in surface sediments and both the size of the subsequent A. fundyense bloom and the extent of shellfish toxicity in that region (McGillicuddy et al. 2011) . In other areas, the size of the inoculum of vegetative cells from cyst germination is thought to be important in bloom initiation, but does not determine the eventual bloom size, which is regulated by factors that affect cell growth and accumulation. For example, Takeuchi et al. (1995) suggested that A. catenella cysts in sediments from Tanabe Bay, Japan, germinate to yield an inoculum of 10-100 cells per liter, and calculated an excystment inoculum of \u223c100 cells per liter for A. fundyense blooms in Cape Cod salt ponds. In both of these areas, the eventual blooms can exceed 100,000 or even 1,000,000 cells per liter, so this requires many divisions from that initial small germination inoculum.",

This type of transport has been invoked for the delivery of the Florida red tide organism Karenia brevis to nearshore waters from an offshore zone of initiation (Walsh & Kirkpatrick 2008) . Another prominent example is the wind-driven delivery of Dinophysis acuminata cells into Bantry Bay, southwest Ireland (Raine et al. 2010) . Physical processes at intermediate scales can lead to the formation of convergence zones, fronts, and upwelling. For example, a linkage has been demonstrated between tidally generated fronts and the sites of massive blooms of Karenia mikimotoi in the North Sea (Holligan 1979) . The pattern generally seen is a high surface concentration of cells at the frontal convergence, sometimes visible as a red tide. Chlorophyll concentrations are generally lower and more uniform on the well-mixed side of the front. Offshore, the bloom may be harmless, but when movement of the front and its associated cells brings toxic HAB populations into contact with fish and other susceptible resources, toxicity or massive mortalities can result.",

Off the French coast, a thin layer of dinoflagellates, including the HAB species Dinophysis acuminata, is frequently observed in the proximity of the thermocline (Gentien et al. 1995) . Other HAB species are also known to form thin subsurface layers at scales as small as 10 cm in the vertical and as large as 10 km in the horizontal. One simple kinematic explanation is that these layers result from the stretching of horizontal inhomogeneities by the vertical shear of horizontal currents. This produces an environment potentially favoring motile organisms that can maintain their position in this layer. Others argue that thin layers result from HAB species' sensitivity to high shear, or to their chemotropism or simple avoidance of grazers.",

This includes the major nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicate, and a variety of micronutrients such as trace metals and vitamins.

There is clear evidence that some HAB species can utilize dissolved organic phosphorus and nitrogen compounds. For example, the brown tide organism Aureococcus anophagefferens has been shown to preferentially use organic nitrogen over nitrate (Berg et al. 1997) . Recent ecogenomic studies have revealed that the ability of A. anophagefferens to outcompete co-occurring phytoplankton in estuaries with elevated levels of dissolved organic matter and turbidity and low levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen may be a result of its larger number of genes involved in light harvesting, organic carbon and nitrogen use, and trace metal utilization compared with competing phytoplankton (Gobler et al. 2011) These findings suggest that anthropogenic activities may have created a niche within coastal ecosystems that suits the unique ecological niche of A. anophagefferens.",

However, it is now widely accepted that the composition and relative proportional availability of nutrient pools, the range of physiological responses by different phytoplankton, and the interactions of other dynamic factors such as physics and grazing are all important controlling responses to cultural eutrophication by HABs. The sources of nutrients that may stimulate blooms include sewage, atmospheric and groundwater inputs, and agricultural and aquaculture runoff. It has been estimated that the flux of phosphorus to the oceans has increased threefold compared with preindustrial, preagricultural levels, whereas the flux of nitrogen increased fourfold into the Mississippi River and more than tenfold into the rivers entering the North Sea (Smil 2001) .

These are especially informative data sets, as they show a decrease in HABs as a result of definitive actions that first reduced nutrient inputs. A more current example of the effect of increasing inputs of algal nutrients from agricultural sources is in China, where the need to feed a rapidly growing population has led to major changes in coastal water quality. For example, nitrate concentrations at the mouth of the Changjiang River have increased fourfold in 40 years, and phosphate concentrations have increased by 30%. The nitrate derives mostly from the mid-and lower reaches of the river, one of the most intensely farmed agricultural areas in China. These non-point-source nutrient inputs have led to significantly higher algal biomass and a change in the phytoplankton community composition. Concurrently, HABs have increased dramatically in this area in both number and size. Approximately 30-80 red tide events have been recorded each year from 2000 to 2005 in the East China Sea, with the scale of some blooms in excess of 10,000 km 2 (Zhou et al. 2008) .",

Bacteria can play an important role in controlling HABs and regulating their impacts, including their toxicity (Kodama et al. 2006) . Bates et al. (1995) showed that the toxicity of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia was dramatically enhanced by the presence of bacteria in laboratory cultures. By examining bacterial communities in Karenia brevis blooms using 16S rRNA clone libraries, Jones et al. (2010) found positive correlations between the HAB populations and certain bacterial groups. Ishida et al. (1997) demonstrated that a bacterium could be responsible for the decline of Karenia mikimotoi blooms in Japan. Bacteria may also interact with HABs in a positive manner by stimulating their growth. Cyanobacteria, in particular, establish mutually beneficial consortia by chemotactically attracting and supporting microorganisms involved in nutrient cycling and the production of growth factors. Anderson et al. (2001) review the different approaches adopted by countries and commercial enterprises worldwide to monitor and manage HABs in coastal waters. This is typically accomplished through the establishment of programs for toxin and cell detection (and quantitation) in water, aerosols, shellfish, fish, etc.; development of bloom forecasting and early-warning capabilities as well as medical intervention and therapeutic strategies; and, to a growing extent, development of bloom prevention and mitigation strategies. There are, however, many challenges associated with these activities, owing to the complexity and diversity of HAB phenomena. Resource managers and regulatory officials must deal with multiple toxins and multiple toxic algal species, multiple toxic fisheries resources, and large-and small-scale HAB events that occur intermittently. Many new technologies are emerging that can address these management challenges-more than can be adequately covered here. Instead, we highlight two broad areas where progress has been substantial-new approaches to HAB cell detection and bloom monitoring, and numerical models used for bloom forecasting and hindcasting.",

Progress has been rapid, and probes and assays of multiple types are already available for many of the HAB species. The most promising of these are short pieces of synthetic DNA (probes or primers) that bind to complementary portions of those molecules in the target HAB species. These targets, typically rRNA, can be visualized and/or quantified by a variety of techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; Anderson et al. 2005a) , sandwich hybridization assays (SHAs; Scholin et al. 1996) , and a variety of PCR-based assays (e.g., Penna & Magnani 1999 , Coyne et al. 2005 , Bowers et al. 2006 .

A recent development is the incorporation of antibody-based detection of the ASP toxin domoic acid into the ESP architecture for simultaneous detection of cells and toxin (Scholin et al. 2009) . The capability to detect additional HAB toxins is anticipated soon. The instrument can be bundled with contextual sensors such as a CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) instrument, fluorometer, transmissometer, and nutrient analyzer. Data from the external sensors along with results of the probe assays are uploaded periodically from the deployed instrument to a shore station for analysis and interpretation.

Although biological processes may have contributed to the decline of the bloom, a great deal was learned from this type of physical analysis. A similar approach is followed by a HAB forecasting system developed for Karenia brevis blooms in the Gulf of Mexico (Stumpf et al. 2009) . HAB forecasts are made twice weekly during bloom events, using a combination of satellite-derived image products, wind predictions, and a rule-based model derived from previous observations and research. Blooms are detected and defined using ocean color satellite images, and bloom transport is then predicted using hydrographic modeling with passive particle-tracking techniques.",

One example is a physical-biological model of Alexandrium bloom dynamics that has been developed for the Gulf of Maine region (McGillicuddy et al. 2005 , He et al. 2008 . This model is based on a hydrographic submodel that can realistically simulate water motion over this large region driven by winds, tides, stratification, river runoff, and large-scale forcing from the open ocean. A second submodel is then coupled to the hydrography, simulating the germination of Alexandrium cysts from seedbeds in the region as well as the subsequent growth of the population, regulated by temperature, salinity, sunlight, and nutrients. The timing and rates of cyst germination and cell growth are parameterized from laboratory experiments on cultures of A. fundyense. A temperature-dependent mortality function incorporates a range of loss factors, including grazing and encystment. This model has demonstrated good skill at reproducing observations (Stock et al. 2005 , He et al. 2008 ; Figure 6 ) and has been heavily used for hindcasts (looking at past events to understand underlying mechanisms; He et al. 2008 , Li et al. 2009 .

Major developments in this regard are instruments that can robotically sample water and detect HAB cells and their toxins, such as the ESP described above. A realistic vision for the future would be arrays of moored instruments capable of detecting HAB cells and their toxins (Figure 7) and transmitting this information to shore, where the data can be assimilated into numerical models and used by managers to make decisions for harvesting closures or other mitigation strategies to reduce HAB impacts. In this regard, HAB sensors are viewed by many as an important component of the emerging OOS infrastructure worldwide. ",

A reexamination of the phytoplankton fossil record using increasingly sophisticated geochemical tools is also underway (Dale 2001) and can help to provide this much-needed long-term perspective.

Climate change confronts marine ecosystems with multifactorial stressors such as increased temperature, enhanced surface stratification, alteration of ocean currents, intensification or weakening of nutrient upwelling, stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated CO , reduced calcification from ocean acidification, and changes in land runoff and micronutrient availability (Figure 8) . A number of scattered publications have started to address the topic of HABs and climate change, but they have usually focused on single environmental factors (e.g., CO , temperature increase, stratification), single biological properties (photosynthesis, calcification, nutrient uptake), or selected Summary of known feedback mechanisms between physicochemical climate variables and biological properties of ocean systems involving marine phytoplankton. (Left) Greenhouse warming raises surface temperatures and causes shoaling of mixed-layer depths, but can also have broader impacts on global currents, upwelling, and even the deep-ocean conveyor belt. Selected phytoplankton (such as coccolithophorids) produce dimethylsulfoxide (DMS), acting as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby reducing solar irradiation. (Middle) Increased atmospheric CO drives the biological pump, can alter phytoplankton species composition, and can alter ocean pH, influencing calcification of coccolithophorids but also nutrient availability.

Phytoplankton play a key role in several global biogeochemical cycles and thereby exert important feedback effects on climate by influencing the partitioning of climate-relevant gases between the ocean and the atmosphere. The well-known Gaia hypothesis is based on species such as E. huxleyi and Phaeocystis producing dimethylsulfonium propionate, a precursor of dimethylsulfoxide, which in the atmosphere is oxidized into sulfate, which forms condensation nuclei for clouds (Charleson et al. 1987) . Woods & Barkmann's (1993) \"plankton multiplier\" is an example of a positive feedback mechanism linking greenhouse warming to the biological pump. Enhanced greenhouse CO 2 induces ocean surface warming, diminishing winter convection and nutrient availability and thereby primary production, thus weakening the biological pump and further enhancing atmospheric CO . Any reduction in net ocean CO uptake caused by shifts in ocean circulation or reduced phytoplankton growth in surface waters, reducing the export of organic matter to the deep sea via the biological pump, could lead to an acceleration in the rate of atmospheric CO 2 increase and global warming. Models have estimated that a 50% decrease in oceanic calcification from ocean acidification would thus reduce atmospheric CO 2 by 10-40 ppm, equivalent to 5-20 years of industrial emissions. Another powerful mechanism for algal bloom formation occurs through top-down control of the marine food web . Overfishing removes top fish predators, stimulating small fish stocks that graze away zooplankton, thus relieving phytoplankton grazing pressure. The impact of past whaling in the Southern Ocean and its impact on iron cycling is actively being researched (Roman & McCarthy 2010) . Differential impacts of climate change on individual zooplankton or fish grazers (uncoupling between trophic levels) can thus result in stimulation of HABs.",

Some species of harmful algae (e.g., toxic dinoflagellates benefiting from land runoff and/or water column stratification, or tropical benthic dinoflagellates responding to increased water temperatures and coral reef disturbance) may become more prevalent, while others may diminish in areas currently impacted. Changes in phytoplankton communities provide a sensitive early warning for climate-driven perturbations to marine ecosystems. Phytoplankton monitoring should therefore play an integral role in planned OOSs, which are necessary if we wish to detect long-term change, define management options, forecast ocean-related risks to human health and safety, and shed light on the impact of climate variability on marine life and humans in general. A long-term commitment to these observatory systems is needed, however, as detection of change will otherwise be difficult.",

Increased public health, tourism, fishery, and ecosystem impacts from HABs have led to heightened scientific and regulatory attention and an increased awareness of the value of ocean ecosystems to human society. HABs represent a biological component of coastal waters that challenges present technologies, in part because of the need for species-or toxin-specific detection capabilities. Advanced technologies are now available for identification and enumeration of HAB species and for extraction and analysis of seafood toxins. One vision for the future is that these functions will be incorporated into instruments that can be deployed along coastlines in networked arrays, performing analyses in situ and transmitting results to shore, where the information can be used by managers directly, while it is also assimilated into numerical models to improve forecasting accuracy. This type of advance warning and prediction of bloom transport and landfall can help minimize impacts and sustain productive fisheries, even in areas with recurrent HAB outbreaks. Another component of this vision is that the development and application of the advanced technologies of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics will continue to provide revolutionary shifts in our understanding of the ecology, evolution, and biogeography of HAB species. We will better understand the link between HABs and human activities, such as ballast water introductions or stimulation of blooms by anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Historically, the conceptual understanding of HABs in eutrophic systems has been based on the simplistic notion that more nutrients yields higher algal biomass. However, we now recognize that the composition and relative availability of nutrient pools, the range of physiological responses by different phytoplankton, and the interactions of other factors such as physics and grazing are all important aspects of the linkage between eutrophication and HABs. This knowledge will lead to informed policy decisions on point and nonpoint nutrient discharges that should lead to reductions in some of the high-biomass HABs that are so characteristic of polluted coastal waters. We can also anticipate changes in phytoplankton communities as a sensitive early-warning indicator for climate-driven perturbations to marine ecosystems. With this will come range expansions by some HAB species and contractions or even the disappearance of others. Many of these thoughts are speculative, but one thing is certain-the global problem of HABs will challenge scientists and managers for many years to come.",

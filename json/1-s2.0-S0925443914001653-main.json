    "abstract": "As signaling pathways evolve, selection for new functions guides the co-option of existing material. Major transitions in the history of life, including the evolution of eukaryotes and multicellularity, exemplify this process. These transitions provided both strong selection and a plenitude of available material for the evolution of signaling pathways. Mechanisms that evolved to mediate conflict during the evolution of eukaryotes may subsequently have been co-opted during the many independent derivations of multicellularity. The soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) signaling pathway illustrates this hypothesis. Class III adenylyl cyclases, which include sAC, are found in bacteria, including the \u03b1-proteobacteria. These adenylyl cyclases are the only ones present in eukaryotes but appear to be absent in archaeans. This pattern suggests that the mitochondrial endosymbiosis brought sAC signaling to eukaryotes as part of an intact module. After transfer to the proto-nuclear genome, this module was then coopted into numerous new functions. In the evolution of eukaryotes, sAC signaling may have mediated conflicts by maintaining metabolic homeostasis. In the evolution of multicellularity, in different lineages sAC may have been co-opted into parallel tasks originally related to conflict mediation. Elucidating the history of the sAC pathway may be relatively straightforward because it is ubiquitous and linked to near universal metabolic by-products (CO 2 /HCO 3 \u2212). Other signaling pathways (e.g., those involving STAT and VEGF) present a greater challenge but may suggest a complementary pattern. The impact of the mitochondrial endosymbiosis on cell signaling may thus have been profound.

Pathways evolve because cells or organisms that possess a particular pathway are able to collect and respond to information that is ultimately environmental. The result is a fitness advantage. A historical view, however, is also relevant. Cells and organisms are not so much designed as they are cobbled together. Evolution of novel traits may often depend on what material is available to be co-opted into a new function. This may be the case with signaling pathways as much as with any other aspect of biological adaptation.",

These transitions involved an expansion of levels or units of selection [3] , including the transitions from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and from unicellular to multicellular organisms.

Some aspects may be totally obliterated, others may be partially intact, and occasionally a nearly complete record of a mechanism and its history may be found-the molecular equivalent of Lagerst\u00e4tten, exceptionally rich and detailed fossil deposits.",

Just as rich fossil deposits can illuminate more fragmentary remains, sAC may shed light on the evolution of other signaling pathways during major transitions in the history of life. This central point is elaborated below. First, an evolutionary framework for understanding the major transitions is outlined. With this in mind, the history of the sAC pathway is traced in an evolutionary hypothesis that is consistent with the available data. From this example, two principal tenets emerge: (i) signaling pathways in the proto-mitochondrion were co-opted into parallel uses in the proto-eukaryote, and (ii) these signaling pathways were then repeatedly co-opted as multicellular eukaryotes emerged. Tenets (i) and (ii) are then further examined with two other examples. While the sAC pathway may be particularly widespread because it is linked to near universal metabolic by-products (CO /HCO 3 \u2212 ), other more fragmentary examples may nevertheless provide support for the overall perspective.",

Nevertheless, the implications of endosymbiosis for eukaryotes are only now being explored and appreciated. The central question is no longer whether mitochondria are products of endosymbiosis, but rather how this endosymbiosis occurred and what its effects were [6, 7] . What happens when a community of bacteria takes up residence in a host cell? How can this lead to a stable association? What legacies of these early interactions remain in modern eukaryotes? What is the relationship between eukaryotic innovations and subsequent evolutionary transitions? These are some of the questions that need to be more carefully considered.",

These units include some molecules (e.g., genes, prions, mobile genetic elements), some organelles (mitochondria, plastids), cells, organisms, and populations. Notions of levels of selection date back to Darwin [10] . Of course, selection at the different levels may not be of equal strength.

Life can be viewed as a hierarchy of units organized like Russian dolls-genes within chromosomes, chromosomes within simple cells, simple cells with complex cells, and so on. There is thus an unexpected simplicity to the history of life. Lower-level units banded together to form groups. Mechanisms that decrease variation among the lower-level units and increase variation among the groups evolved to mediate conflicts [12] . Groups that effectively deployed these mechanisms of conflict mediation successfully emerged as higher-level units. Higher-level units, being larger, had a number of ecological advantages over the original lower-level units [13] . Subsequently, these new units could band together and repeat the process.",

Yet there were two large obstacles that likely prevented gene transfer from having an impact early in the endosymbiosis [6] . The first was the difficulties associated with evolving de novo the mitochondrial protein import apparatus, without which proto-mitochondria could not lose genes. The second was that selection pressure itself would prevent gene loss, if indeed retaining those genes benefited the proto-mitochondrion. The argument thus becomes uncomfortably circular: to occur, gene loss requires relaxed selection on the lower-level units, but such relaxed selection can only be achieved by gene loss.",

While these characteristics are inherent in chemiosmotic function, surprisingly complex dynamics can nonetheless result. If substrate is limiting, the trans-membrane proton gradient becomes minimal, electron carriers become oxidized, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is minimal ( Fig. 1a : state 2). If substrate is available, and there is metabolic demand, substrate will be oxidized at a rapid rate. Coenzymes (NAD + and FAD) will be reduced and re-oxidized rapidly. Electrons will rapidly proceed through the electron carriers, reducing oxygen to water, while protons are extruded. The redox state of the electron carriers and ROS levels will be moderate ( Fig. 1b: state 3 ). If substrate is available but there is no metabolic demand, electrons back up on the electron carriers, and the trans-membrane proton gradient becomes maximal.

Co-opting material from the previous evolutionary transition, involving the mitochondrial endosymbiosis, was one way to facilitate the transition to multicellularity. Metabolic signaling may again be the key. On this basis, a prediction can be made: cell signaling pathways that regulate competition among cells in a multicellular organism (sensu Minelli [18] ) may have been derived from similar pathways that regulate competition among mitochondria in eukaryotic cells, and both sets of pathways may involve metabolic signaling. Nevertheless, testing this hypothesis may be challenging because of the effects of loss, reversal, and extinction on the character states of extant organisms. Analogous to the fossil record, the history of some signaling pathways may be only partially intact (or partially described). These may or may not support the interpretation offered above. Nevertheless, either way this evidence is not decisive. More critical are considerations of the molecular Lagerst\u00e4tten-those pathways that are well preserved.

Class III adenylyl cyclases (ACs), however, are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [20, 21] . Indeed, these class III cyclases are widely found, including in \u03b1-proteobacteria, and both unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. In the well-studied mammals, two types of class III ACs are found: transmembrane adenylyl cyclases and soluble adenylyl cyclases. Of the two, the latter seems most similar to those in bacteria [20] .

Sporadic reports of adenylyl cyclases in archaeans have been made [25, 26] . There remains some expectation that class IV ACs may yet be found in this group [27] .

                "text": "The roots of adenylyl cyclases may extend to the RNA world when nucleotides first became widely used by living things [28] . The adenylyl cyclase reaction could originally have run in reverse, generating ATP or GTP from cAMP or cGMP, while consuming pyrophosphate [25] . Such a reaction would convert pyrophosphate, the pre-RNA world energy currency [29] , to ATP or GTP, the RNA world energy currency. Adenylyl cyclases may have had their origins as such \"currency exchangers.\" Running in a forward direction, the initial signaling function of class III ACs may have been related to the CO 2 /HCO 3 \u2212 produced as a byproduct by the Krebs cycle, the roots of which may extend to the earliest days of intermediary metabolism [30, 31] . It is noteworthy that archaeans lack class III ACs. Possibly because of their unusual metabolism, archaeans may have had less need to detect metabolic CO 2 /HCO 3 \u2212 and hence lost type III ACs. Alternatively, type III ACs may have been derived by bacteria after their divergence from archaeans. Genetic and genomic data strongly support the hypothesis that the proto-mitochondrion was an \u03b1-proteobacterium [32] . A consensus is also emerging that the host of the proto-mitochondrion was an archaean [33] . A parsimonious explanation for the observed distribution of class III ACs is that they were brought to eukaryotes as part of an intact signaling module via the mitochondrial endosymbiosis (Fig. 2 ). Subsequent to this endosymbiosis, eukaryotes and archaeans diverged, i.e., archaeans that acquired protomitochondria became eukaryotes Fig. 1 . Schemata of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in different redox states. Substrate is oxidized and electrons follow a path (small arrows) through the electron carriers of complexes I-IV to molecular oxygen. Protons are extruded (large arrows) and return to the mitochondrial matrix via ATP synthase (V). In state 2 (A), substrate is limiting, the redox state of the electron carriers is relatively oxidized, the transmembrane proton gradient and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation are both minimal, and ADP relative to ATP is maximal. In state 3 (B), substrate supply is adequate, and substrate is actively oxidized, for instance by the Krebs cycle, reducing coenzymes NAD + and FAD. Metabolic demand is high. The redox state of the electron carriers, the proton gradient, ROS, and ADP levels are all intermediate. Phosphorylation rates are maximal. In state 4 (C), substrate is oxidized, and coenzymes are reduced, but metabolic demand is weak. ADP relative to ATP is minimal, the proton gradient is maximal, electron carriers are highly reduced, and ROS formation is maximal. If substrate supply varies over time, a sudden increase might overwhelm the capacity of the electron transport chain to oxidize NADH and FADH , resulting in state 4 (C). Input of electrons overmatches metabolic demand, the trans-membrane proton gradient becomes maximal, the electron carriers become reduced, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation becomes maximal. Under these conditions, damage can occur. Signaling via CO 2 /HCO 3 \u2212 (produced as a by-product of oxidation of substrate in the Krebs cycle) and sAC/cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) can \"prime\" the electron carriers for the arrival of NADH and FADH 2 (C). A moderate proton gradient, intermediate redox states, and low to moderate levels of ROS can then be maintained (B). Uncertainty about the mechanism by which cAMP activates respiration is indicated by the \"?.\" Fig. 2 . Schemata depicting the evolution of the sAC signaling pathway. Solid lines indicate phylogenetic descent, while the dotted line shows the endosymbiotic event that led to the origin of eukaryotes. Timescale is approximate. The host of the proto-mitochondrion, an \u03b1-proteobacterium, is here depicted as an archaean, which diverged from other archaeans at the time of the endosymbiosis. In modern taxa, type III adenylyl cyclases, which include sAC, are found in bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, and multicellular eukaryotes. The sAC signaling module may have been transferred intact to eukaryotes by the mitochondrial endosymbiosis. After transfer to the proto-nuclear genome, signaling with sAC was co-opted into signaling in unicellular eukaryotes and ultimately in multicellular eukaryotes. [34] . One of the many consequences of this transition was that the proto-eukaryote inherited a bacterial metabolism and hence a bacterial system for regulating this metabolism, i.e., class III ACs. Modern \u03b1-proteobacteria are diverse, both taxonomically [35] and metabolically, often exhibiting both photosynthesis and respiration [36] . Class III ACs are found in \u03b1-proteobacteria [20, 21] , but functional studies have focused on cyanobacteria, in which cAMP has been found to regulate respiration [37] . Metabolic CO 2 /HCO 3 \u2212 may modulate this effect via sAC signaling [38] . While further functional studies are clearly required, a role for sAC in the regulation of respiration may also be found in \u03b1-proteobacteria. At least several of the extant \u03b1-proteobacteria exhibit respiratory chains and respiratory control strikingly similar to modern mitochondria [39, 40] . A reasonable hypothesis is that sAC signaling functioned in proto-mitochondria much as it does in modern mitochondria.",

In other words, selection acting on individual proto-mitochondria within a host cell favored different traits than selection acting on the group of proto-mitochondria within a single host cell. In order for the higher-level unit to emerge, mechanisms to mediate these conflicts necessarily had to evolve. The higher-level unit is not equivalent to the host cell. Rather, it is a community of prokaryotes including one host and potentially many proto-mitochondria. As pointed out above, mechanisms that mediate conflicts typically decrease variation among lower-level units or increase variation among higher-level units [12] . In the former case, selfish lower-level units are less likely to evolve. In the latter case, selection can remove higher-level units that function poorly because of lack of cooperation among lower-level units.",

State 3 protomitochondria efficiently convert substrate into ATP with moderate production of ROS. If substrate supply overmatches metabolic demand (as for instance in human diabetes, e.g. [46] ), the levels of ATP relative to ADP become maximal, and the redox state of the electron carriers shifts in the direction of reduction (Fig. 1c) . Under these state 4 conditions, ROS production increases dramatically, and such protomitochondria can damage themselves. From the perspective of protomitochondria, an oversupply of ATP is a liability. The adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) was thus an evolutionary innovation to dispose of surplus ATP. ANT evolved due to selection on individual protomitochondria for metabolic homeostasis. ANT did not evolve to promote group-level cooperation, but it had that effect as a by-product. The distinction is important, since early in the endosymbiosis group-level selection (i.e., selection on the emerging proto-eukaryote) is generally conceded to have been weak relative to individual-level selection (i.e., selection on individual proto-mitochondria).",

ANT also contributed to signaling between the symbiont community and the cytosol. Signaling with sAC can be viewed in this context. As substrate was oxidized in protomitochondria, NADH, FADH 2 , and carbon dioxide were produced (Fig. 1c) . CO 2 /HCO 3 \u2212 activated sAC and initiated the cAMP signaling that \"primed\" the electron transport chain for the arrival of NADH and FADH 2 . In this way, proto-mitochondria avoided state 4 and maintained state 3. Signaling with sAC in proto-mitochondria could thus maintain metabolic homeostasis and constrain proto-mitochondrial variation [7] . If sAC signaling was a proto-mitochondrial trait, it could nevertheless quickly be transferred to the cytoplasm of the proto-eukaryote. Damaged proto-mitochondria would have released their DNA into the cytoplasm. Prior to the evolution of the nucleus, this DNA could quickly incorporate into the host genome. Recombination would associate proto-mitochondrial genes with host promoters. Proto-mitochondrial genes would then be expressed in the cytosol [47] . The sAC pathway could then be recruited into signaling roles in proto-eukaryotes very early in the endosymbiosis. Such traits may have provided a fitness advantage for the proto-eukaryotes that exhibited them.",

This supports the hypothesis that mechanisms that mediated conflicts in the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition may be co-opted to mediate conflicts in subsequent transitions to multicellularity. More general insight into the evolution of multicellularity may also be provided. Relative to animals and fungi, amoebozoans likely exhibit a less-derived form of multicellularity. Thus the initial steps in the evolution of multicellularity may generally have been connected to food supply, i.e., the advantages of greater size only outweighed the disadvantages when food was limiting. Since it is triggered by by-products of metabolism, CO 2 /HCO 3 \u2212 , and by derivatives of the primary energy currency, ATP, sAC signaling is closely related to metabolism and metabolic state. Metabolic signaling via sAC may be a form of \"honest signaling,\" in which the signal provides an accurate barometer of metabolic state [52] . [53] . Corals contain sAC genes and exhibit high levels of cAMP production [54] . Symbiont migration, driven by ciliated coral cells lining the gastrovascular system, may thus result directly from impaired photosynthesis [55] .",

Testing this hypothesis, however, is challenging. JAK-STAT signaling diversified primarily in the vertebrate animals, and these have been the focus of most studies. Phylogenetic analysis of JAK-STAT pathway components [60] may be consistent with STAT3 representing the ancestral STAT function (e.g., Fig. 12 of [60] ). A Stat-like protein similar to STAT3 has also been detected using immunochemical assays in bacteria [61] . Understanding the evolution of STAT3 clearly requires better characterization of the distribution and function of Stat-like proteins in bacteria and non-metazoan eukaryotes. Against the background of mechanisms generating gene diversity in eukaryotes (e.g., gene duplication and domain shuffling, [60, 62] ), it may not be possible to definitively resolve this history. Nevertheless, the idea of a proto-mitochondrial function mediating metabolism followed by co-option into a role in cell-cell signaling is intriguing particularly in the context of the example of sAC signaling outlined above.",

In a broader sense, the role of modern VEGF-B may suggest the deep roots of cystine-knot signaling in eukaryotes. Cysteine-rich proteins may generally be expected to function in redox-regulated signaling [68] . A connection between such redoxregulated proteins and ancestral cystine-knot proteins may thus be expected.",

Plausibly, the original function of certain cysteine-rich proteins was to activate fatty acid transporter proteins in the proto-eukaryote. These proteins may have originated as symbiont proteins that connected protomitochondria to an external food supply. Alternatively, they may have originated as host proteins that regulated the availability of food for proto-mitochondria. By regulating proto-mitochondrial metabolic state, these cysteine-rich proteins could mediate conflicts. These proteins may have maintained this function in unicellular eukaryotes. Except for a few key residues, their amino acid sequences rapidly diverged in different lineages, resulting in an uncertain pattern of homology. With the origin of metazoans and possibly other multicellular eukaryotes, these proteins may have been recruited to new functions involving conflict mediation, e.g., angiogenesis (Fig. 3) .

As suggested by the sAC example, such regulators may have mediated conflict in the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition. The modern roles of STAT-family proteins (regulation of immune function) and VEGF-family proteins (angiogenesis) suggest a prominent role in the mediation of cell-cell conflict. While it remains unclear whether the history of either of these proteins can be reliably traced, further support for the perspective developed here may still be suggested. When eukaryotes become multicellular, these within-cell pathways of conflict mediation may then have been co-opted into between-cell pathways. The success of eukaryotes in mediating within-cell conflicts may have preordained their success in mediating between-cell conflicts and thus achieving multicellularity. Certainly, eukaryotes have achieved notable success as multicellular organisms [69] . The challenges that had to be overcome in forming a higher-level unit out of a community of energy-converting lower-level units [70] may have given eukaryotes a remarkable toolkit to overcome such conflicts in subsequent evolutionary transitions. Perhaps this is the evolutionary version of the familiar Nietzschean quote-what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, or at least more evolvable.",

During the major transitions in the history of life, there were both strong selection for new functions and a plenitude of material available to be co-opted. New signaling pathways may have been particularly likely to evolve during these transitions. Further, at least from an evolutionary perspective these transitions have repetitive features: conflicts among lower-level units had to be mediated in favor of the higherlevel unit. It thus seems logical or at least possible that mechanisms of conflict mediation from earlier transitions (e.g., prokaryote to eukaryote) could be co-opted into similar functions in later transitions (e.g., the repeated evolution of multicellularity). Testing this hypothesis, however, is challenging. With constant extinctions, losses, and reversals, the history of many signaling pathways is as fragmentary as our knowledge of these pathways.",

Consequently, there are many protein components to this signaling system-pumps and exchangers, plasma membrane channels, organelle channels, buffers, and so on. Using available genome sequences of a diverse array of eukaryotes, Collins and Meyer [4] determine whether homologs to the human genes for these proteins exist in these various taxa and carry out a phylogenetic analysis of the resulting sequences. This analysis strongly supports the idea that the first eukaryotes utilized calcium signals and points to some interesting evolutionary patterns, e.g., Ca 2+ -regulated phospholipase C\u03b4 (PLC\u03b4), which can produce IP (inositol triphosphate), is more broadly distributed and possibly arose earlier than IP 3 R (inositol triphosphate receptor). Appropriately, the authors caution that the ion selectivity and subcellular location of the identified homologs cannot be inferred from the sequence data. Repeated losses of seemly critical components of signaling pathways are also apparent. Further, functional evidence sometimes conflicts with the sequence data, e.g., some species that apparently lack IP R homologs nonetheless exhibit IP 3 -mediated Ca 2+ signaling.",

Thus, if an organism lacks a particular protein, it still may carry out a particular signaling pathway using different means.

Its distribution and function has been well studied for some time [25] . Remarkably, signaling of type III ACs seems to be not only widely distributed but strikingly consistent. The same signaling module appears in bacteria and eukaryotes. In the latter, type III ACs are found in both mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments. At least some functions are shared, e.g., in the bacteria and mitochondria that have been studied, sAC signaling stimulates respiration [38, 41] . The connections between sAC and critical metabolites (CO 2 /HCO 3 \u2212 ) explain both its ubiquity and conserved function. Type III ACs appear to be absent in archaeans. In part, this may indicate the unusual metabolism and limited characterization of archaeans. Nevertheless, both the apparent absence from archaeans and the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial pathways support the hypothesis that this signaling pathway was acquired by eukaryotes from proto-mitochondria.",

As suggested above, the evolutionary history of these signaling pathways is considerably less clear than that of sAC signaling. Yet in each case a possible connection to the mitochondrial endosymbiosis is suggested. Of course, the centrality of mitochondria to metabolism and metabolic signaling provides selective impetus for involvement of mitochondria in signaling. Evolution is never purely about function, however; history plays a role as well. Going forward, further characterization of rare, possibly vestigial, functions of major signaling pathways may provide invaluable insight. Examining signaling functions in obscure, yet phylogenetically relevant taxa may also be illuminating. Such additional data will better clarify the extent to which sAC may serve as a general model for the effects of endosymbiosis on signaling pathways. Fig. 3 . Schemata depicting one scenario of the evolution of signaling pathways such as the VEGF-B pathway. Phylogeny is the same as Fig. 2 . During the period of rapid evolution following the origin of eukaryotes, redox-sensitive, cysteine-rich proteins from both the host and symbiont may have been co-opted into new signaling pathways (A). These pathways may have maintained metabolic homeostasis and thus mediated conflict in the proto-eukaryote. As multicellular eukaryotes evolved, pathways mediating cell-cell conflict evolved (B). Pathways that involved cystine-knot proteins, including VEGF/PDGF, may have been co-opted from redox-sensitive pathways used to regulate proto-mitochondria.

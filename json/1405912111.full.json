                "text": "The Precambrian explosion led to the rapid appearance of most major animal phyla alive today. It has been argued that the complexity of life has steadily increased since that event. Here we challenge this hypothesis through the characterization of apoptosis in reef-building corals, representatives of some of the earliest animals. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that all of the major components of the death receptor pathway are present in coral with high-predicted structural conservation with Homo sapiens. The TNF receptor-ligand superfamilies (TNFRSF/TNFSF) are central mediators of the death receptor pathway, and the predicted proteome of Acropora digitifera contains more putative coral TNFRSF members than any organism described thus far, including humans. This high abundance of TNFRSF members, as well as the predicted structural conservation of other death receptor signaling proteins, led us to wonder what would happen if corals were exposed to a member of the human TNFSF (HuTNF\u03b1). HuTNF\u03b1 was found to bind directly to coral cells, increase caspase activity, cause apoptotic blebbing and cell death, and finally induce coral bleaching. Next, immortalized human T cells (Jurkats) expressing a functional death receptor pathway (WT) and a corresponding Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) KO cell line were exposed to a coral TNFSF member (AdTNF1) identified and purified here. AdTNF1 treatment resulted in significantly higher cell death (P < 0.0001) in WT Jurkats compared with the corresponding FADD KO, demonstrating that coral AdTNF1 activates the H. sapiens death receptor pathway. Taken together, these data show remarkable conservation of the TNF-induced apoptotic response representing 550 My of functional conservation.",

For example, the original concept of self vs. nonself recognition was discovered from observations in echinoderms, whereas the discovery of Tolllike receptors in humans stemmed from investigations into the response of insects to pathogens. Despite the impact of these studies, the majority of our understanding of immune function remains based on data from a select few taxa, mainly Chordata, Arthropoda, and Nematoda, which represent only 3 of the 30 extant animal phyla (1) . Although these models have provided valuable insight into the molecular basis of immune defense, we are overlooking a significant and potentially informative portion of metazoan biology. With the rise of the genomic revolution, an increasing number of genomes from basal phyla are revealing the evolution of immunity to be a nonlinear process, involving multiple instances of gene gain and loss (2) . Therefore, the investigation of nontraditional phyla will provide a deeper understanding of the evolution of immunity, including the potential for the discovery of novel immune reactions.",

Their body plan consists of two cell layers, an endoderm and ectoderm, held together by the jelly-like mesoglea (4) . Stony corals (Order Scleractinia) are colonial cnidarians and are responsible for supporting the most biologically diverse ecosystem on the planet: the coral reef. Reefs support economically important industries such as fishing and tourism and provide coastal protection to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Recent global surveys have indicated that 19% of coral reefs have been destroyed, 15% are under imminent risk of collapse, and a further 20% are under longterm threat of collapse (5) . Anthropogenic impacts such as overfishing and nutrient runoff have been implicated in increased coral death and bleaching (6) . However, although many of the environmental factors leading to coral mortality are well established, the biological mechanisms behind coral death remain poorly understood (7, 8) .",

The intrinsic pathway is initiated by cell stress, whereas the extrinsic pathway is initiated by death ligand/death receptor interactions.

Members of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) are defined by the presence of cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are important for receptor oligomerization (15) . Crystal structure characterization of TNFRSF-TNFSF interactions have also revealed 50s and 90s loop structures that are important for ligand binding and specificity, respectively (15). On ligand binding, the TNFR-1 recruits TRADD, RIP1, and TRAF2, creating complex I, which disassociates from the receptor.

Comparison of these coral TNFSF/TNFRSF members to those of Homo sapiens reveals high genetic and predicted structural conservation. Exposure of coral to human TNF\u03b1 (HuTNF\u03b1) results in apoptotic cellular blebbing, caspase activation, cell death, and finally coral bleaching. Further, we show that exposure of human T-cell lymphocytes to a coral TNFSF member identified and purified here (AdTNF1) directly activates the death receptor pathway in humans. Taken together, these data demonstrate functional conservation of TNF-induced apoptosis across 550 My of evolution. This work also identifies, to our knowledge, the first ligand-receptor signaling pathway to be directly involved in the activation of bleaching and apoptosis in coral. Because coral bleaching events are expected to increase in frequency with future climate change, improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved is prudent for reef conservation and our understanding of the general evolution of apoptosis (23) .",

Thirty-one putative TNF receptorassociated factors (TRAFs) with an average length of 458 amino acids were found to have high conservation with H. sapiens TRAF1 within the TRAF family domain. ( Fig. S1A and Table  S1 ). Twenty putative caspases with an average length of 533 amino acids were found to have high conservation within the \u03b1/\u03b2 fold regions of H. sapiens caspase-3, including residues located within the caspase-3 active site ( Fig. S1B and Table S1 ). Thirteen members of the TNFSF with an average length of 228 amino acids were found to have high conservation with H. sapiens TNF\u03b1 (HuTNF\u03b1) with the TNF ligand superfamily domain ( Fig. 1A and Table S2 ). Forty putative members of the TNFRSF with an average length of 508 amino acids were also identified within the genome of A. digitifera (Table S3 ). All AdTNFRs contained a minimum of one 50s TNF-binding loop (ligand binding specificity) and one 90s binding loop (receptor oligimerization). The total number of CRDs ranged from zero to four. Eleven of the putative TNFRSF's proteins contained death domains (AdTNFR1-AdTNFR11), whereas five contained Ig domains (AdTNFR18-AdTNFR22). Structural threading of AdTNF1/ AdTNFR1 with two members of the human TNFSF/TNFRSF, CD40L and CD40, respectively, suggests high-predicted homology ( Fig. 1 B and C) . Compared with previously published work on members of the TNFRSF, corals contain the most diverse TNFRSF repertoire of any organism described to date, including humans (Table S4) . A. digitifera also possess other canonical apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2 members (8), inhibitors of apoptosis (4), APAF-1, FADD, and cytochrome c ( Fig. 1D ). Fig. S2 shows the phylogenetic relationships between AdTNFs, AdTNFRs, AdCasps, and AdTRAFs and H. sapiens homologs.",

S3 and S4). To characterize the cellular response of coral to HuTNF\u03b1, we first performed immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that HuTNF\u03b1 binds directly to coral cells ( Fig. 2 A and B) . Next we exposed a 20-\u03bcm cultured coral cell to HuTNF\u03b1 under live confocal microcopy and found evidence of apoptotic blebbing within 10 min of treatment ( Fig. 2C ). Quantification of a second 7-\u03bcm cell type extracted from adult coral tissue revealed an increase in the number of visible apoptotic cells after 90 min of HuTNF\u03b1 exposure (Fig. 2D ). HuTNF\u03b1 caused a shift in the percentage of apoptotic cells from \u223c15% in the untreated coral cells to \u223c75% in the HuTNF\u03b1-treated cells (n = 200 cells counted; Fig. 2E ). HuTNF\u03b1 exposure was also found to significantly increase (P < 0.0001) caspase activity of extracted coral cells relative to a negative control inhibitor (Z-FA-FMK; BD Pharmigen) ( Fig. 2F ). Furthermore, 4 h of HuTNF\u03b1 exposure resulted in a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the total number of dead coral cells (Fig. 2G ).

Mass spectra data were compared with a custom-built coral protein database created from the predicted proteome (13) . Four separate spots were identified as coral myosin (adi_v1.18643), which increased on HuTNF\u03b1 exposure (Fig. 3A, spots 2, 3, 5 , and 6). The predicted molecular mass of coral myosin is \u223c316 kDa, whereas the four identified myosin spots ranged from 70 to 84 kDa, suggesting cleavage. In addition, the banding pattern observed in Fig. 3C is suggestive of myosin phosphorylation. The initial induction of apoptosis also affects calcium signaling (24) , and following HuTNF\u03b1 exposure, two proteins that contain an EF-hand calcium binding site and calreticulin were found to be up-regulated (Table S5 ), suggesting that HuTNF\u03b1 affects calcium signaling in corals. Finally the Zooxanthallae-specific protein Peridinin was also up-regulated, providing initial evidence that HuTNF\u03b1 affects coral-algal symbiosis ( Fig. 3C and Table S5 ).",

A diagram representing the constructs for the secretion of GFP and AdTNF1 is presented in Fig. S5A . As a control, a construct with GFP fused to a Prolactin signal sequence was also created (pBMN.i.mChGFP). 293T cells transfected with pBMN.i.mChGFP displayed stable expression of GFP localized to the endoplasmic reticulum/trans-Golgi, as expected of secreted proteins (Fig. S6B) .

Propidium iodide staining demonstrated that FasL negatively affects WT cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, whereas FADD KO cell viability is unaffected (Fig. S7A ). Next we exposed both WT and FADD KO cells to AdTNF1. Following 48 h of AdTNF1 treatment, WT Jurkat cells exhibited a significant (P < 0.0001) reduction in cell viability compared with the FADD KO cells, demonstrating that coral AdTNF1 directly interacts with the death receptor pathway in humans, increasing cell death ( Fig. 4D and Fig. S7B ).",

(21) explored the origin and evolution of the TNF receptor-ligand superfamilies and concluded that their evolutionary origin could be traced back to single copy genes within arthropods. They posit that these founding genes underwent multiple duplication events following the divergence of invertebrates and vertebrates, which coincided with the development of the adaptive immune system (21) . However, this study failed to take into account the recently published Cnidarian genomes of Nematostella vectensis and A. digitifera (2, 13) . The existence of 40 putative coral TNF receptors (AdTNFR1-AdTNFR40) and 13 putative coral TNF ligands (AdTNF1-AdTNF13) identified here suggests a far more ancient origin of the TNF receptor-ligand superfamily that precedes arthropods. Our data demonstrate high conservation of TNFRSF/TNFSF members in corals, suggesting the last common metazoan ancestor possessed a functional TNF apoptotic pathway, which subsequently underwent gene reduction in arthropods and other invertebrates. Corals possess more putative members of the TNFRSF of any organism described thus far and possess a similar number of putative TNFSF proteins as many vertebrates (Table S5) (21) . Although the function of AdTNFR1-AdTNFR40 and AdTNF1-AdTNF13 still requires elucidation, the TNF receptor-ligand superfamily has clearly undergone dynamic changes throughout the various lineages of metazoan evolution, independent of a particular phylum's structural complexity. Similar complexity has also been observed in the Cnidarian N. vectensis within the Nme and Wnt gene families, a complexity that has also been lost in other model ecdyzoans (28, 29) . These studies, along with ours, highlight the need to take into account the genomes of a broad range of animal phyla before we can draw broad conclusions about the evolution of gene families.",

For example, in D. melangastor, the Toll-like receptor pathway is involved in the response to microbial infection. On immune stimulation, protease cascades lead to the activation of the cytokine Spatzle (33) . In humans, the related pathway involves the Toll-like receptor (IL1-R1) and its respective ligand (IL-1) (34). Although both the D. melangastor Toll and human IL-1 pathways converge on the activation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor homologs, IL-1 and Spatzle do not show any significant similarity at the amino acid level. Furthermore, the completed genome of D. melangastor failed to reveal any proteins homologous to human IL-1. From these data, it was concluded that invertebrates lack any 3 .

Beyond the specific IL-1 pathway, multiple vertebrate and invertebrate cytokines have been shown to exhibit similar biological functions, yet they lack any genetic homology (30) . It was therefore postulated that the similar biologically activities of these cytokines is a result of convergent evolution. However, the vast majority of data supporting this hypothesis are taken from the model systems of D. melangastor and Caenorhabditis elegans, which as discussed above have lost complexity in multiple gene networks. The high amino acid conservation between coral TNFRSF members and HuTNF\u03b1, as well as the activation of apoptosis in coral using a human cytokine, support the hypothesis of a divergent evolution of the TNF receptor-ligand superfamily. Future work should focus on the cytokine repertoire of other phyla to develop a comprehensive hypothesis of metazoan cytokine evolution.",

Within FADD, two essential domains designated the death domain (DD) and death effector domain (DED) are required for apoptotic transduction (35) . A putative FADD protein containing the DD and DED domains has been identified in both Hydra and the A. digitifera proteome (aug_v2a.04795) (36, 37) . On activation of apoptosis, the phosphorylation and cleavage of the myosinlight chain are critical for the subsequent morphological changes involved with cellular blebbing (38) . Fragments of coral myosin were found to significantly increase on HuTNF\u03b1 stimulation, and the associated banding pattern in response to HuTNF\u03b1 is suggestive of a phosphorylation event (Fig. 3C) . Furthermore, the acidic shift of the 92 proteins could also be the result of a larger phosphorylation cascade (Fig. 3B) (39) . Interestingly, one of the most highly upregulated proteins in the HuTNF\u03b1-stimulated gel contained a Zona-Pellucida (ZP) domain, which has traditionally been studied within the context of fertilization (40) . Although ZP domain proteins have not been well studied within the context of TNF signaling in humans, preexposure of sperm to HuTNF\u03b1 impairs sperm binding (41) . The role of ZP domain proteins in the coral TNF signaling cascade should be a focus of future studies.",

AdTNF1 was purified through His-tag nickel affinity chromatography (Monserate Biotechnology Group) and used for subsequent experimentation. Jurkat WT and Jurkat FADD KO cells (ATCC CRL-2572) were exposed to AdTNF1, stained with propidium iodide, and sorted through flow cytometry. See SI Materials and Methods for further details.",

    "abstract": "Reef-building corals form essential, mutualistic endosymbiotic associations with photosynthetic Symbiodinium dinoflagellates, providing their animal host partner with photosynthetically derived nutrients that allow the coral to thrive in oligotrophic waters. However, little is known about the dynamics of these nutritional interactions at the (sub)cellular level. Here, we visualize with submicrometer spatial resolution the carbon and nitrogen fluxes in the intact coral-dinoflagellate association from the reef coral Pocillopora damicornis by combining nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and transmission electron microscopy with pulse-chase isotopic labeling using [ C]bicarbonate and [ 15 N]nitrate. This allows us to observe that (i) through light-driven photosynthesis, dinoflagellates rapidly assimilate inorganic bicarbonate and nitrate, temporarily storing carbon within lipid droplets and starch granules for remobilization in nighttime, along with carbon and nitrogen incorporation into other subcellular compartments for dinoflagellate growth and maintenance, (ii) carbon-containing photosynthates are translocated to all four coral tissue layers, where they accumulate after only 15 min in coral lipid droplets from the oral gastroderm and within 6 h in glycogen granules from the oral epiderm, and (iii) the translocation of nitrogen-containing photosynthates is delayed by 3 h. IMPORTANCE Our results provide detailed in situ subcellular visualization of the fate of photosynthesis-derived carbon and nitrogen in the coral-dinoflagellate endosymbiosis. We directly demonstrate that lipid droplets and glycogen granules in the coral tissue are sinks for translocated carbon photosynthates by dinoflagellates and confirm their key role in the trophic interactions within the coral-dinoflagellate association.",

However, the possible incorporation of photosynthates such as glucose (9) into coral glycogen has not been investigated. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the allocation and turnover of photosynthates within the dinoflagellate subcellular compartments, especially in their C storage structures, which are LDs and starch granules (27, 28) .",

Here, we used this methodological approach on microcolonies (nubbins) of the common Indo-Pacific symbiotic reefbuilding coral Pocillopora damicornis, which were pulse-labeled in an aquarium for 6 h simultaneously with [ C] \u03ea ), followed by an extended chase of 186 h under either normal light/dark cycling (12 h/12 h) or prolonged darkness. We used [ 15 N]nitrate to unambiguously track the flow of N in the endosymbiotic system because nitrate is assimilated by the dinoflagellates only, in contrast to ammonium, the preferred source of DIN for most reef corals, which is simultaneously assimilated by both dinoflagellate and coral cells (32, 33) .",

In contrast, incorporation into coral LDs from the three other epithelia was much less efficient and occurred with a 3-h delay ( Fig. 2A, B , and E; see Data Set S1 and Fig. S6 ).

In particular, by labeling the reef coral Acropora pulchra simultaneously with [ 13 C]bicarbonate and [ 15 N]nitrate, Tanaka et al.

Conversely, in Stylophora pistillata colonies, the rapid decrease in 14 C or 13 C labeling of the dinoflagellate fraction, observed over a chase period of 24 to 48 h, was mainly ascribed to delayed translocation of 14 C-or 13 Clabeled photosynthates to the coral host partner (17, 39) .",

Similarly, we demonstrate that prolonged dark pretreatment (24 h) fully repressed nitrate assimilation in dinoflagellates of the reef coral P. damicornis. Interestingly, in coastal marine environments, migrating free-living dinoflagellates reach the illuminated sea surface, poor in DIN, during the day, to accumulate excess photosynthates not channeled toward protein synthesis, whereas they descend during the night to a depth enriched in nitrate, which is then efficiently assimilated through the remobilization of light-produced C reserves (43) . Hence, the storage of lipids and carbohydrates by dinoflagellates during daytime might constitute a C reserve helping reef corals to efficiently sustain DIN acquisition during nighttime, representing an adaption to nutrient-poor environments.",

By combining pulse-chase double stable-isotopic labeling ( 13 C and 15 N) with TEM ultrastructural and NanoSIMS isotopic imaging, we have visualized and quantified at subcellular levels the incorporation and turnover of C and N in the symbiotic reef-building coral P. damicornis. These results provide a qualitative baseline of subcellular allocation and turnover of C-and N-containing photosynthates in the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis. In the future, more precise quantitative C and N budgets for symbiotic reef corals could be constructed, using additional respiration and photosynthesis measurements. Moreover, alterations in the pattern of C and N utilization by symbiotic corals might be more precisely characterized in response to heterotrophic feeding and to global environmental changes. Isotopic dual labeling pulse-chase experiments were conducted in closed-system 20-liter glass tanks. In a first step, 17 coral microcolonies were incubated for 6 h in light in 0.2-m-pore-filtered artificial seawater (adapted from Harrison et al. [50] ), initially free of bicarbonate and nitrate, and supplemented with 2 mM [ 13 . This pulse of isotopic dual labeling started about 2 h after the onset of the light period. Then 5 coral microcolonies were transferred for a 186-h (8-day) chase period with light/dark cycling (12 h/12 h) in a tank filled with 20 liters artificial seawater sampled from the large acclimatization tank with normal C and N isotopic composition. The effect of coral autotrophic starvation on C and N remobilization pattern was investigated in a parallel 186-h chase experiment with 5 coral microcolonies exposed to similar conditions but maintained under constant darkness. During the chase phase, 25% of the incubation volume was renewed daily with artificial seawater from the large acclimatization tank. For TEM ultrastructural and NanoSIMS isotopic imaging, apexes of coral branches were sampled with cutting pliers during the pulse-chase experiments at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 192 h, respectively. At each time step, a different coral microcolony (nubbin) was sampled, except at 6 h, where 3 replicate nubbins were sampled. Throughout the pulse-chase experiment under light/dark cycling, coral microcolonies displayed no macromorphological indications of stress (i.e., no unusual tentacle retraction, extensive mucus secretion, or paling). During the chase period, ammonium and nitrate concentrations fluctuated mildly between values of 1 to 4 M and to 10 M, respectively, corresponding to closed-system aquarium conditions.",

Coral samples were chemically fixed for 24 h at room temperature in S\u00f6rensen-sucrose phosphate buffer (0.1 M phosphate at pH 7.5, 0.6 M sucrose, 1 mM CaCl 2 ) containing both 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% formaldehyde. They were then decalcified for 4 to 5 days in 0.1 M S\u00f6rensen phosphate buffer containing 0.5 M EDTA at 4\u00b0C. Tissue samples were dissected under the stereomicroscope into small pieces containing one or two polyps, postfixed 1 h at room temperature with 1% OsO 4 in 0.1 M S\u00f6rensen phosphate buffer, dehydrated in graded series of ethanol (50, 70, 90 , and 100%), and embedded in Spurr's resin. Tissue was preferentially oriented to obtain longitudinal sections parallel to the vertical growth direction of polyps. Sections were cut with a Diatome 45\u00b0diamond knife. Semithin sections (~0.5 m) were stained with methylene blue-Azur II and observed with a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 light microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCamMRc 5 digital camera. Ultrathin sections (~70 to 90 nm) were mounted on Formvar carboncoated alphanumeric grids counterstained with 4% uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate solution. Ultrastructural observations were carried out at 80 kV with a Philips CM 100 transmission electron microscope within the Electron Microscopy Facility (EMF) at the University of Lausanne (Switzerland).",

NanoSIMS quantification of both 13 C and 15 N enrichments was carried out by defining regions of interest (ROIs), as illustrated in Fig. S2 in the supplemental material. For the whole dinoflagellates and their C reserves (i.e., starch granules and LDs), the ROIs were obtained by drawing their contours. Quantification of the remaining cell compartments (i.e., the whole dinoflagellate cell minus the C reserves) was obtained by subtracting corresponding ROIs. In the coral host tissue, ROIs were defined as circles of 2 to 3 m covering each of the four coral epithelia, avoiding the mesoglea and intercellular spaces. For coral LDs, ROIs were obtained by drawing their contours. Because their small size (~50 nm in diameter) prevented accurate drawing of ROIs around each glycogen granule, their accumulation and turnover were assessed qualitatively from NanoSIMS line scans, and the spatial correlation between isotopic labeling and glycogen granules was confirmed in merged TEM and NanoSIMS images.",

Experiments were carried out on microcolonies (~5 cm tall) of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis (Linnaeus, 1758) prepared from one large colony grown at the Aquarium Tropical, Palais de la Porte Dor\u00e9e, Paris, France. Coral microcolonies were acclimatized for 4 weeks prior to experimental manipulation in a large tank equilibrated with fish and benthic organisms, filled with artificial seawater (Instant Ocean Salts) and containing low nutrient concentrations (NH 4 \u03e9 , \u03fd1 M; NO 2 \u03ea , \u03fd1 M; NO 3 \u03ea \u03fd5 M; PO 4 3\u03ea , \u03fd1 M [Salifert tests]). The temperature was 25 \u03ee 1\u00b0C, the salinity was 35 \u03ee 1\u2030, and the pH was 8.1 \u03ee 0.1.

During the acclimatization period of 4 weeks and subsequent experiments, coral microcolonies were not fed with plankton and therefore mostly relied on the uptake and assimilation of particulate and dissolved organic matter and on the autotrophic input from their photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts.",

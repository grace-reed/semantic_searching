Previous studies had shown that the endolithic community consists of filamentous algae, especially chlorophytes of the genus Ostreobium, cyanobacteria and fungi [14] [15] [16] . More recently, molecular studies revealed the presence of several bacteria, such as Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Chlorobi, including nitrogen fixers and green sulfur bacteria [17] . Several functions were attributed to this community, such as providing potential nutrient sources [18] and photoprotection for the coral host [19, 20] , particularly during bleaching events. Fine & Loya [18] showed increasing C activity with time in coral tissues after addition of C inside the endolithic band of bleached corals; however, they did not evaluate this process in terms of the organic matter synthesized and transferred.",

The separated pigments were detected spectrophotometrically using a photodiode array detector (SPD-M30AD; Shimadzu) with an optical resolution of 1.2 nm over a wavelength range from 320 to 720 nm. Each peak was identified by comparing HPLC retention times with the absorption spectra of standards and the data obtained from photodiode array detection.

In this study, O. quekettii largely dominated the endolithic photosynthetic community of P. lutea. Other studies have also found Ostreobium spp. as the dominant endolithic algae in living and dead corals [35, 36] . In particular, Ostreobium spp. are known for their capacity to harvest light under low light intensity because of their exclusive photosynthetic pigment composition, which includes Chl b and far red-absorbing Chl a that act as antennae under lower illumination conditions [37] . The Chl a : Chl b ratio in plants is widely used as an indicator of tolerance in shaded areas [38] . The normal shade-adapted ratio in higher plants is approximately 3, whereas highly shade-adapted Ostreobium spp. may reach a ratio of 1.26-2.8 [35, 39] . In this study, the Chl a : Chl b ratio of endoliths varied from 1.6 to 2.9 (healthy corals) and 1.9 to 3 (bleached corals) (electronic supplementary material, table S1 and figure 4). Figure 4 shows that, in the endoliths of healthy corals, after 12 h light and 24 h light plus dark incubations, the proportion of Chl b increased, and the Chl a : Chl b ratio decreased after 24 h. By contrast, Chl b decreased and Chl a increased during the 12 h light incubations in the endoliths of bleached corals, showing a rapid response to the better illumination condition under the bleached coral tissues. The increased proportion of Chl a in the bleached condition resulted in a higher Chl a : carotenoid ratio. However, after 24 h of incubation, the drastic drop in this ratio shows that the endolithic algae might be affected to some extent by oxidative stress after being exposed to higher illumination. This pattern can be also observed from the increase in allomer : total Chl a along the incubation, as this ratio can be used to estimate the oxidative state of Chl a [40] . These rapid variations in the pigments of endolithic algae illustrate their plasticity to acclimatize to drastic environmental changes. Moreover, our measurements of photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of endolithic algae living in healthy and bleached corals (figure 3) showed that Chl a fluorescence measurement of the endolithic community was similar in these two conditions. This result reveals comparable photosynthetic performance under both coral conditions, which is in agreement with previous observations [41] . Nevertheless, a slight decrease in Chl a fluorescence measurement after 24 h of incubation showed that some stress under non-shading conditions might decrease the photosynthetic performance with time. This result is in agreement with the important decrease in the Chl a : carotenoid ratio.",

The most notable result in this study is the quantitative measurement (in terms of organic C and N) of primary production, nitrogen fixation and translocation from the endolithic community. These measurements were obtained under both normal and bleached conditions. Our incubation design allowed us to measure the primary production of zooxanthellae in coral tissues (Addition incubation) and that in the endolithic community (Injection incubation). Moreover, we calculated the proportion of carbon photo-assimilates that the endolithic community could transfer to the coral tissues under both healthy and bleached conditions. In the Addition incubation, 13 C was added to the water in incubation bottles containing coral pieces; therefore, uptake of 13 C by zooxanthellae and their primary production rates were well measured. However, C did not reach the endolithic zone in a direct and timely manner, and therefore, the primary production of endoliths was highly underestimated. In the Injection incubation, 13 C solution was directly added inside the green band of the endoliths; therefore, primary production of the endolithic algae was clearly revealed (table 2) and the translocation could be estimated by following the increase in C atoms (%) in coral tissues (figure 5). The difference in C atom content (%) between the Injection and Addition incubations allowed us to calculate the proportion of translocated assimilates from endoliths.",

This is due to their capacity to harvest light even under low illumination conditions [34] , and therefore might surpass our incubation time set-up of 12 h light. Moreover, the primary production of endoliths in the bleached corals was lower than that of endoliths in healthy corals. This pattern is in agreement with the lower Chl a concentration (electronic supplementary material, table S1) and can be interpreted as a high respiration rate of endoliths in the bleached corals owing to oxidative stress. This can be attributed to the effect of high illumination resulting in inhibition of the photosystem of the algae because they are more adapted to photosynthesize under low light conditions. The lower primary production of endoliths in bleached corals (0.11 \u00b5g C cm \u22122 d \u22121 under the bleached condition versus 0.54 \u00b5g C cm \u22122 d \u22121 in the healthy condition) and the concomitant increase of primary production in coral tissues (0.64-2.51 \u00b5g C cm \u22122 d \u22121 ) exemplify the translocation pattern from the endoliths towards the bleached coral tissues during the dark period. However, C atom (%) incorporation showed that translocation in healthy corals was higher, meaning that corals in the healthy condition may have higher respiration (consumption) rates.

However, the N fixation rates of the endoliths in the healthy and bleached corals were similar. Moreover, N 2 fixation was higher during the first 12 h of the illuminated period, except in the case of bleached corals in which N fixation was increased, and this pattern was similar to that of primary production. This result suggests that some nitrogenous compounds can be also translocated from the endolithic layer towards the coral tissue.",

Rapid responses by changing their pigments to different illumination conditions and extended photosynthetic period are important acclimatization features of the endolithic community to rapid environmental changes. Not only under stressful but also under normal conditions, photo-assimilates from the endoliths are translocated to the coral tissues together with some nitrogen-rich compounds. Our study is the first to provide quantification of the primary production, N fixation and translocation of organic matter from the endolithic community towards the coral tissues in both the normal and bleached coral scenarios. Further studies are necessary to understand how photo-assimilates are transported during translocation. Moreover, photoprotection by the production of antioxidants in the endolithic community needs to be investigated.",

A collagen IV scaffold, a major component, is essential for tissues and dysfunctional in several diseases. Studies of bovine and Drosophila tissues reveal that the scaffold is stabilized by sulfilimine chemical bonds (S = N) that covalently cross-link methionine and hydroxylysine residues at the interface of adjoining triple helical protomers. Peroxidasin, a heme peroxidase embedded in the basement membrane, produces hypohalous acid intermediates that oxidize methionine, forming the sulfilimine cross-link. We explored whether the sulfilimine cross-link is a fundamental requirement in the genesis and evolution of epithelial tissues by determining its occurrence and evolutionary origin in Eumetazoa and its essentiality in zebrafish development; 31 species, spanning 11 major phyla, were investigated for the occurrence of the sulfilimine cross-link by electrophoresis, MS, and multiple sequence alignment of de novo transcriptome and available genomic data for collagen IV and peroxidasin. The results show that the cross-link is conserved throughout Eumetazoa and arose at the divergence of Porifera and Cnidaria over 500 Mya. Also, peroxidasin, the enzyme that forms the bond, is evolutionarily conserved throughout Metazoa. Morpholino knockdown of peroxidasin in zebrafish revealed that the cross-link is essential for organogenesis. Collectively, our findings establish that the triad-a collagen IV scaffold with sulfilimine cross-links, peroxidasin, and hypohalous acids-is a primordial innovation of the ECM essential for organogenesis and tissue evolution.",

The emergence of larger, more complex animals able to resist predation and colonize new environments was enabled, in part, by a collagen scaffold, which anchors cells together to form tissues and organs. Here, we show that a unique chemical bond, a link between sulfur and nitrogen atoms called a sulfilimine bond, arose over 500 Mya, binding this scaffold together and enabling tissues to withstand mechanical forces. Peroxidasin forms the bond by generating hypohalous acids as strong oxidants, a form of bleach, which normally function as antimicrobial agents.

Unambiguous detection of the bond required knowledge of NC1 domain primary structure for each species under study, identification of NC1 dimer subunits by SDS/ PAGE, and mass spectroscopic analysis of tryptic peptides derived from the cross-linked dimer subunits that putatively contain the sulfilimine cross-link. This approach is presented in Fig. 1 for the human collagen IV scaffold. NC1 hexamers, excised by collagenase digestion, were dissociated into dimeric and monomeric subunits by SDS/PAGE ( Fig. 1A ) and subsequently visualized by protein stain and immunoblot (Fig. 1B) . The presence of dimer subunits indicates presence of a sulfilimine cross-link. To unambiguously establish the presence of the cross-link in the dimer subunits, tryptic peptides containing Met 93 and Hyl 211 were analyzed by high-resolution Orbitrap MS (Orbitrap) as previously described (20) . A loss of mass equivalent of two hydrogen atoms was observed between the theoretical mass of an uncross-linked peptide and the observed mass of the cross-linked peptide ( Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A ). Furthermore, olefin and methylsulfonamide fragment products generated by multistep collisioninduced dissociation (CID) fragmentation (MS 2 /MS 3 ) analyses of multiple charge state ions were observed ( Fig. S1 B-D) . Together, these data provided unequivocal chemical evidence for the presence of the sulfilimine cross-link, which was previously delineated for bovine, murine, and Drosophila NC1 domains (20, 21) .",

These findings are congruent with the conservation of Met 93 and Hyl 211 residues across Eumetazoa ( Fig. 2A ). Definitive evidence for the cross-link among species of the major phyla spanning Radiata, Protostoma, and Deuterostoma was achieved by FTMS analysis of trypsin-digested NC1 peptides. The analyses for Macaca mulatta, Danio rerio, Ascaris suum, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Nematostella vectensis are shown in Figs. S3, S4, S5, S6, and S7, respectively. In each case, loss of two hydrogen atoms between the theoretical and the observed peptide mass and the CID fragmentation pattern of the tryptic peptide containing Met 93 and Hyl 211 showed the presence of the sulfilimine cross-link. Collectively, the analyses reveal the occurrence of the sulfilimine cross-link in all of the major eumetazoan phyla, and the appearance of the cross-link coincided with the divergence of Porifera and Cnidaria. Importantly, these findings extend earlier studies of collagen IV in invertebrates (23) (24) (25) (26) and reveal that the collagen IV scaffold itself, stabilized by sulfilimine cross-links, is conserved throughout eumetazoan phyla.",

The multidomain feature of peroxidasin [the peroxidase domain, leucine-rich repeat domains, and Ig-like domains] is conserved within cnidarians and bilaterians alike (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, the von Willebrand factor type C domain is only conserved within Bilateria, suggesting a role in bilaterian innovations such as tubular epithelia, circulatory systems, or striated muscle.

This species does not contain Met 93 and Lys/Hyl 211 residues or peroxidasin, features that are required for bond formation (Fig. 2 ), but it does contain peroxinectin, an invertebrate heme peroxidase that is known to be involved in innate immunity (28) . These findings indicate that the cnidarian stem ancestor possessed the bond and suggests that Hydra underwent a secondary gene loss, a phenomenon previously described for Hydra (29) . The mesoglea of Hydra is complex, composed of both basement membrane and an interstitial matrix of various collagens (30) , and it seems designed for flexibility rather than mechanical strength (31) . Nondenaturing, nonreducing buffers do not solubilize collagen IV scaffolds in other metazoans but easily extract Hydra collagen IV, suggesting a general absence of cross-links (32) . Although the relative fragility of the mesoglea is tolerated in Hydra, the advent of mesoderm and the emergence of muscular tissue in Bilateria likely required additional mechanical strength, which was provided by the sulfilimine bond, enabling the evolution of complex tissues for locomotion and increased body size. and Monosiga and short on one end for Saccoglossus, which is indicated here by a shortened schematic representation.

NC1 hexamers were excised from animal basement membranes and analyzed by SDS/PAGE as shown in Fig. 1 A and B.

Sulfilimine cross-link is essential for invertebrate tissue genesis as recently described for the protostomes D. melanogaster and C. elegans (21, 33) . We extended the investigation of essentiality to vertebrate and deuterostome development using the zebrafish model. The expression levels of collagen IV \u03b11 and \u03b12 chains and peroxidasin were measured during early zebrafish development. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) studies showed up-regulation of all three components during gastrulation (Fig. 4A) . To probe the importance of the bond in early development, morpholino oligomers were designed to inhibit the translation of peroxidasin and microinjected into fertilized one-cell stage embryos. At 24 h postfertilization (hpf), embryos were assessed and found to display a phenotypic ratio of normal development (20/ 45 embryos), partial curved trunk (21/45 embryos), and severely defective (4/45 embryos), which consisted of cardiac edema, decreased eye size, and gross trunk patterning effects (Fig. 4 D-F) . To determine the effect of the inhibitory morpholinos on bond formation as measured by the presence of cross-linked NC1 dimers, whole embryos were digested with collagenase, and the excised NC1 hexamers were analyzed by SDS/PAGE. The phenotype with partial curved trunk presented with a total absence of dimer bands, indicative of decreased sulfilimine crosslinks, as well as a decreased content of collagen IV (Fig. 4G) . These results indicate that the developmental expression of the cross-linked collagen IV scaffold occurs during gastrulation and that the scaffold is of functional importance for organogenesis.",

Furthermore, peroxidasin is the only animal heme peroxidase spanning both invertebrates and vertebrates (28) , and it shares a peroxidasin-like ancestor with the vertebrate peroxidases: myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, and lactoperoxidase (27) . Thus, in invertebrates, the hypohalous acids formed by peroxidasin may have a dual function of forming sulfilimine cross-links and serving as a primitive form of innate immunity. Indeed, mosquito gut peroxidasin is up-regulated after bacterial infection, and its knockdown reduces bacterial clearance and host survival (36) . (Fig. S8 ).",

The analytical column was packed with 20 cm C18 reverse phase material (Jupiter; 3-\u03bcm beads, 300 \u00c5; Phenomenex) directly into a laser-pulled emitter tip. Peptides were gradient-eluted at a flow rate of 500 nL/min, and the mobile phase solvents consisted of 0.1% formic acid and 99.9% water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid and 99.9% acetonitrile (solvent B). A 90-min gradient was performed and consisted of 0-10 min (sample loading), 2% B; 10-50 min, 2-35% B; 50-60 min, 35-90% B; 60-65 min, 90% B; 65-70 min, 2-90% B; 70-90 min (column equilibration), 2% B. On gradient elution, peptides were mass analyzed on either an LTQ Orbitrap XL or LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific); each mass spectrometer is equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source. The instruments were operated either using a data-dependent method or with a targeted method to enable analysis of low-abundant cross-linked NC1 peptides. For data-dependent analyses, full scan (m/z = 400-2,000) spectra were acquired with the Orbitrap as the mass analyzer (resolution = 60,000), and the three most abundant ions in each MS scan were selected for fragmentation in the LTQ, which was followed by data-dependent MS 3 analysis of the three most abundant ions in each MS 2 scan. An isolation width of 2 m/z, an activation time of 30 ms, and 35% normalized collision energy were used to generate MS 2 and MS 3 spectra. The MS n AGC target value was set to 1e 4 or 2e 4 , and the maximum injection time was either 150 or 250 ms, respectively. For MS 2 scans, a minimum threshold of 500 was used to trigger data-dependent spectra, whereas a threshold of 500 or 100 was used to trigger MS 3 spectra. Dynamic exclusion was enabled, with an exclusion duration of either 20 (LTQ Orbitrap Velos) or 60 s (LTQ Orbitrap XL). For analyses where cross-linked peptides were too low in intensity to be selected data-dependently, targeted methods were performed. Full scan spectra were similarly acquired in the Orbitrap, but specific m/z values were provided in the data acquisition method to facilitate MS 2 and MS 3 fragmentation irrespective of the intensity of precursors.",

First, raw data files were manually searched for sulfilimine cross-linked peptides using the Xcalibur 2.2 QualBrowser software (Thermo Scientific). To calculate the monoisotopic mass of the sulfilimine cross-linked peptides, the mass of two hydrogen atoms was subtracted from the sum of the masses for Met 93 -and Lys 211 -containing peptides, each generated using GPMAW version 8.00sr1 (Lighthouse Data) as previously shown in the work by Vanacore et al. (20) . Second, sulfilimine cross-linked peptides not found manually were identified by searching the bovine, mouse, D. rerio, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, or N. vectensis subsets of the UniprotKB database (www.uniprot.org) using either SEQUEST (Thermo Scientific) on a high-speed, multiprocessor Linux cluster in the Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education at Vanderbilt University or the Myrimatch algorithm (37) on a two six-core Intel Xeon processor HP Proliant DL160 G6 server running Windows server 2008 R2 enterprise using the Bumbershoot suite (38) . The search files were adapted for the identification of peptides that included the amino acid modifications of interest [i.e., \u221248.0034 on Met and +45.9877 or +61.9826 on Lys as well as carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.0214) and oxidation of methionine (+15.9949)]. The result files obtained from SEQUEST and/or Myrimatch were assembled using IDPicker (39) and/or Scaffold 3.6.4 (Proteome Software). MS 3 spectra matching peptides containing modified Lys 211 or Met 93 were confirmed by either manual evaluation or processing the raw data files through ScanRanker (40) , and the spectra were annotated with IonMatcher.",

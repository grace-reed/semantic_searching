    "abstract": "Heat stress is an environmental factor that regularly challenges the well-being of living organisms. This study aims to examine the physiological changes happening in two reef-building coral species exposed to thermal stress under various light conditions. The two ecologically relevant heatwave scenarios were applied under ambient lights (high irradiance) and reduced light conditions (250 and < 10 \u03bcmol photons m \u00c0 s \u00c0 1). Corals were exposed to elevated temperatures of 32 \ufffd C (plus 6 \ufffd) for a period of 1 up to 5 days corresponding to heatwaves reported on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) that were associated with coral bleaching. We monitored changes in the physiological performance of these two coral species by measuring symbionts and corals' physiological parameters including symbiont density, levels of multiple algal pigments (chlorophyll a and peridinin), as well as the changes in the host protein concentration. During the short-term heat stress, both species were with stable physiological performance with the only exception of Stylophora pistillata under ambient lights. These results show that S. pistillata was negatively influenced by a synergistic effect of temperature and high irradiance resulting in the first signs of bleaching after only 24h of thermal stress. Exposure to prolonged thermal stress, characterised with a slower rate of temperature increase, affected both coral species investigated and resulted in bleaching mainly by day 5. Interestingly, severe light reduction (<10 \u03bcmol photons m \u00c0 2 s \u00c0 1) made Acropora millepora corals more thermally sensitive and resulted in earlier signs of bleaching (on day 3). These findings indicate that there was a synergistic effect of very low lights and thermal stress that caused higher levels of bleaching in A. millepora. Our results revealed differential thermal sensitivity for two branching corals exposed to different thermal stress scenarios under various light irradiance conditions, naturally found in their existing habitats. Consequently, global warming may have a differential impact on coral reef biodiversity depending on light availability.",

                "text": "Coral reefs are one of the most species-rich habitats on Earth, hosting almost one-third of the world's marine fish species (Moberg and Folke, 1999) . Reef-building corals belong to the Scleractinia order and the vast majority form an obligatory symbiosis with photosynthetic unicellular algae, dinoflagellate from the family Symbiodiniaceae (LaJeunesse et al., 2018) . These unicellular algae live inside the tissue of hermatypic corals and provide oxygen, sugars, lipids, and amino acids to the coral host, in return for crucial nutrients like inorganic carbon, ammonia, and phosphate (Trench, 1979) . The symbiosis between corals and their dinoflagellate symbionts is sensitive to changes happening in the environment (van Oppen and Gates, 2006; Hoeksema and van der Meij, 2013) . One of the best visual indicators of ongoing stress on the reef is coral bleaching, which occurs due to the reduction of algal pigments and/or the numbers of symbiotic dinoflagellates within the tissue of the coral host (Hoegh-Guldberg and Jones, 1999) . Various environmental stress factors may contribute to bleaching including elevated seawater temperature, ocean acidification, and light stress including ultra-violet radiation (UVR) (Gates et al., 1992; Dunlap and Malcolm, 1998; Anthony et al., 2008; Rosic et al., 2014; Kaniewska et al., 2015) .",

                "text": "Incidents of mass coral bleaching have increased in intensity and frequency in recent decades (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007) . Due to a record high sea temperatures during 2015/2016, a higher percentage of severely bleached reefs were reported compared to previous bleaching events on the GBR (Hughes et al., 2018) . Corals exposed to mild thermal stress may survive and recover their dinoflagellate symbionts, but typically they express reduced growth and calcification (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007) and a decrease in coral productivity (Anthony et al., 2008) . Light irradiance, including both visible light and UV radiation, is another important factor for coral productivity and growth (Gates and Eomund, 1999; Bessell-Browne et al., 2017) . Light level decreases with the water depth following the Beer-Lambert law (Gordon, 1989) . The possibility of solar bleaching due to exposure to high light irradiance on its own without a combination with elevated temperature is reported to be only localised (Berkelmans, 2002; Brown and Dunne, 2015) . Some external factors such as low cloud cover and blue skies result in higher light levels and clear waters like described in the Gulf of Eilat, Red Sea (Winters et al., 2009) . Thermal stress combined with high irradiance has been reported to result in damage to host tissues and coral dinoflagellates (Lesser and Farrell, 2004) (Downs et al., 2013) . Higher temperatures have been found to promote bleaching susceptibility and mortality of the thermally sensitive corals by reducing the light intensity threshold, leading to photoinhibition and bleaching (Bhagooli and Hidaka, 2004) . The destructive effects of UVR on marine organisms were also reported for different marine species including corals and their algal symbionts (Lesser and Farrell, 2004) . Negative effects of UVR were described on dinoflagellate in culture resulting in decreased algal growth rates and reduced chlorophyll a concentrations (Dunlap and Malcolm, 1998) . Consequently, exposure to UVR has been recognized as an important abiotic factor leading to coral bleaching (Gleason and Wellington, 1993) , especially in combination with thermal stress (Torregiani and Lesser, 2007) .",

Coral fragments were collected from the six different, visually healthy, colonies (displaying a full tissue pigmentation) of Acropora millepora and Stylophora pistillata. Sample collection occurred on the reef flat at Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia (23 \ufffd 25 0 S; 152 \ufffd 07 0 E) during the Australian summer (Nov 2013). Our Acropora millepora harbours Symbiodiniaceae, old classification Symbiodinium Clade C (LaJeunesse et al., 2003) , while Stylophora pistillata at shallow depths harbours Symbiodinium Clade C, genotypes C35a, C78a or C8a (Sampayo et al., 2016) . After collection, the coral fragments were divided using wire cutters into a single coral nubbin (~7 cm length) and immediately transferred to flow through aquaria to acclimatise for 48 h. Coral branches were randomly distributed across 18 aquaria, ~10 cm depth inside the aquarium with 3 aquaria per each experimental condition under the flow rate of ~0.4 L/min. Additional details and schematic presentation of the experimental settings are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1 .",

All processes were done in the dark (or minimum luminosity) and cold, to prevent pigment degradation. After centrifugation (5000xg, 5 min, 4 \ufffd C), the FSW was removed, and the pellet re-suspended in 1 mL of ice-cold 100% methanol. The suspension was then mixed by vortex, homogenized with a pipette, followed by sonication on ice-cold water for 10 min, and centrifugation (5000xg, 5 min, 4 \ufffd C). The supernatant was collected and transferred into a clean tube. Another 1 mL of ice-cold 100% methanol was added to the pellet again, and the mixing and centrifugation were repeated three times or more until the pellet became completely white. Then, the combined supernatant, containing the pigments, was filtered (using a 0.22 \u03bcm filter) and 300 \u03bcL was used for the reverse-phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analyses. Pigments were separated using a Shimadzu SCL-10 HPLC linked to a Shimadzu SPD-M10A photodiode array detector. We used a Phenospere 5 \u03bcm C8 80A HPLC column (Phenomenex, Australia) and the method of Zapata et al. (2000) .

The harmful effect on the physiology of S. pistillata was noted only when heated corals were exposed to high irradiance ambient lights. These results demonstrated that acute thermal stress and high irradiance synergistically caused the bleaching effect. However, at low irradiance conditions, corals were able to endure heat exposure over 24 h without changes in physiological performance. Similarly, in the Caribbean coral, Montastraea faveolata, heat stress was the principal cause for coral bleaching when exposed to high irradiances (Lesser and Farrell, 2004) . S. pistillata is a very common coral species found on the GBR particularly under high light irradiance and is normally able to endure unstable environmental conditions (Loya, 1976) . Improved thermo-tolerance was reported for S. pistillata and another branching corals from the Gulf of Aqaba after 4 weeks of exposure to \u00fe4 \ufffd C under low light intensity conditions (Bellworthy and Fine, 2017) . However, after short thermal stress, the threshold light intensity leading to photoinhibition in thermally sensitive coral S. pistillata was lower at 32 \ufffd C (\u00fe10 \ufffd C) compared to 26 \ufffd C (\u00fe4 \ufffd C) (Bhagooli and Hidaka, 2004) . Here, we did not observe bleaching under reduced lights at 32 \ufffd C (\u00fe6 \ufffd C), but under high irradiance accompanied by a strong UVR level. In coral dinoflagellates kept in cultures, when heat stress was combined with UVR, oxidative stress and inhibition of photosynthesis were reported (Lesser, 1996) . However, high irradiance without heat stress was not found to be sufficient to cause bleaching, except when combined with elevated temperatures (Berkelmans, 2002) . The absence of light stress was found to mitigate the negative impacts of temperature increase (\u00fe4 \ufffd C) in terms of the absence of oxidative damage (Hawkins et al., 2015) . The fact that rapid thermal stress had an effect after only one day on S. pistillata under high irradiances, but not under reduced lights, indicates the combined synergistic effects of temperature and high UV radiation causing bleaching.",

Here, the incremental rise in temperature achieved 32 \ufffd C after ~2.5 days and corals bleaching thresholds for both examined coral species showed roughly similar patterns. Relative to the equivalent temperature control treatment, the majority of heated corals were visually and based on physiological parameters healthy on day 3. However, following day three, a reduction in symbiont density, algal pigments, and host water-soluble proteins became evident by day five. For another branching coral A. aspera from the shallow waters of Heron island (GBR), there were no signs of bleaching after 3 days of thermal stress under ambient lights (Rosic et al., 2014) , but bleaching was confirmed after 4 days of heat stress (Fisher et al., 2012) . Earlier signs of bleaching were observed here after 3 days in heated A. millepora under VLL, but not under ambient and LL. Elevated temperatures plus very low light conditions, in this case, may have a synergistic effect resulting in advanced bleaching than what might occur in regular photosynthetically productive conditions. Reduced light levels were described in shallow waters due to the increased turbidity like that seen after storms (Hennige et al., 2008) or after the underwater volcanic eruption (Albeck-Ripka, 2019; Dockrill, 2019; Herbertson, 2019) . Organisms respond to changes in light intensity via the process of photo-acclimation (Titlyanov et al., 2001; Anthony and Hoegh-Guldberg, 2003; Hennige et al., 2008; Lohr et al., 2019) . However, in shallow and turbid waters, reduced light conditions have been reported to negatively impact photosynthesis and calcification in Acropora tenuis and to lower the corals' energy balance (Strahl et al., 2019) . The host protein concentration in heated A. millepora corals was significantly reduced just after 3 days compared to controls under VLL, suggesting an increased sensitivity of corals to bleaching under reduced lights.",

                "text": "Host cells have a flexible, but finite capacity for symbiotic cells, and must, therefore, regulate algal numbers (Muscatine et al., 1998) . Regulatory processes include degradation or digestion of existing symbionts (Titlyanov et al., 1996) , as well as the expulsion of intact symbionts (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 1987) , both of which can lead to bleaching. In response to environmental changes, these processes allow corals to save energy, by diminishing the amount of energy used to maintain existing symbionts (Dimond and Carrington, 2008) . The increased thermal sensitivity of A. millepora under VLL was not noted for S. pistillata indicating the higher dependence on photosynthetic products in A. millepora. On the other hand, S. pistillata was not affected by prolonged thermal stress so early on under VLL and was possibly capable of obtaining the carbon via means other than photosynthesis. Interestingly, no signs of bleaching were observed in S. pistillata on day 3 under high irradiance conditions. These conditions were in some ways equivalent to the end of the short-term experiment, with a difference in ~3x slower temperature increase and double time at 32 \ufffd C (12h). It seems that there was no interaction between thermal stress and high UV as seen at STE for S. pistillata, possible due to a slow change in temperature. Consequently, a slower increase in temperature to \u00fe6 \ufffd C, possibly resulted in higher thermal tolerance and postponed the detrimental bleaching process. In another study, S. pistillata exposed to mild heat stress \u00fe4 \ufffd C had a higher photoinhibition threshold than when exposed to more severe \u00fe10 \ufffd C (Bhagooli and Hidaka, 2004) . Consecutive exposure to heatwaves resulted in acclimatisation and an increase in the thermal tolerance of massive long-lived Porites corals from GBR (DeCarlo et al., 2019) . Consequently, our findings indicate that the thermal sensitivity of coral species under various light environments may be influenced by both heatwave profiles, light conditions, and specifically UV level. Therefore, light availability may be a critical factor, which affects not only the distribution of corals but also their response to increasing incidences of heatwaves.",

Differential bleaching profiles were detected, with S. pistillata seeming to be more sensitive to short term thermal stress than A. millepora. Nevertheless, short term acute exposure to thermal stress was detrimental to S. pistillata only when combined with a strong effect of UV radiation, resulting in a bleaching effect. In A. millepora, potentially synergistic effects of very low light and prolonged thermal stress may have caused higher levels of bleaching than what might occur under high irradiance. Consequently, depending on the heating rates, the light conditions may be a tipping point towards postponing or speeding up the bleaching progression. Subsequently, global warming under diverse light intensities and UV radiation will jointly influence coral bleaching modelling maps and have a clear impact on reef biodiversity and the coral community composition.",

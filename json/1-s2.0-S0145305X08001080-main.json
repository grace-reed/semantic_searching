                "text": "Scleractinian corals are sessile marine invertebrates that form the framework of coral reefs and sustain an enormous biodiversity. However, coral reefs are experiencing increased levels of stress from a range of factors including diseases and bleaching-loss of their algal symbionts (Symbiodinium) [1] [2] [3] . There has been a rapid increase in investigation of coral diseases and stress responses over the last decade, yet study of the scleractinian coral immune system remains in its infancy. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogen defence and symbiont uptake in corals despite their inherent association with coral disease and bleaching. A fundamental feature of the innate immune system of all metazoans is the ability to identify non-self utilising pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognise and bind surface structures on external foreign entities [4] . A PRR binding event can initiate signalling cascades that induce a downstream immune response or immediate reactions such as agglutination of invading cells and opsonisation for phagocytosis [4, 5] . In addition, agglutination and phagocytosis assist in symbiont uptake by animals [6, 7] . We therefore hypothesised that keystone elements of non-self recognition in both coral immune responses and symbiotic processes may be found amongst the pattern recognition proteins. The interest in invertebrate PRRs has also increased over the last few years as it has become evident that invertebrates may utilise an alternative adaptive immune system involving highly variable PRRs [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . An important group of PRRs in vertebrates and invertebrates are the lectins, proteins that can recognise carbohydrate structures on non-self cells [14] [15] [16] . Mannans, consisting of multiple densely packed terminal mannose residues, are abundant carbohydrate entities on the surface of nonmetazoan cells and function as key targets for several lectins involved in immunity, including that of the well-studied vertebrate mannose-binding lectin (MBL) [17] . Bioinformatics studies on expressed genes have found that corals appear to have high ancestral complexity and have many genes in common with vertebrates [18] . Some of these genes do not appear in many other invertebrates, suggesting extensive gene loss in these taxa [18] . Hence, studies into coral immunity may provide novel information on the evolution of the early innate immune system of animals. One example reflecting the presence of unexpected immune-related genes in corals is the discovery of complement C3 [19, 20] . This molecule interacts with MBL in a complex system in vertebrates and a more simplified system in higher invertebrates, further fuelling the interest to investigate coral lectins with preference for mannose. We used mannose affinity chromatography to isolate a protein from the coral Acropora millepora that we have named Millectin, which is the first functional PRR to be described in a scleractinian coral. The protein binds both pathogens and algal symbionts, suggesting lectins may have been co-opted from an ancient innate immune system into a role in selecting and maintaining the photosynthetic endosymbionts in reef-building corals. Millectin is an ancient relative of the collectins MBL and SP-A and has extensive sequence variation in the binding region, providing insight into the function and evolution of the innate immune system.",

The sequence appears complete with start codon and associated poly A tail. The amino acid sequence determined by Edman degradation was located in the predicted protein, confirming its identity and suggesting that N-terminal cleavage has occurred as the deduced Nterminal sequence appears first in amino acid position 54 of the full-length predicted protein ( Figure 2 ). The predicted processed protein from deduced N-terminal sequence corresponds to the estimated size of Millectin determined by SDS-PAGE, further confirming the identity of the protein (Figures 1 and 2) . Sequence analysis revealed that the protein contains a signal peptide for secretion, although this is shorter than the cleaved product. The protein contains a C-type lectin domain in the C-terminal of the protein, with a conserved EPN (mannose-binding) motif and a predicted N-glycosylation site. While the short N-terminal of Millectin shares no sequence homology with previously characterised proteins, the C-type lectin domain that spans the majority of the sequence (Figures 2 and 3) is homologous, and shares vital amino acid positions (Figure 3 ) with the lectin domain of a range of C-type lectins involved in immunity in other animals. These include vertebrate CD23, SP-A, mannose receptor, DC-SIGN and MBL (Figure 3) .

No agglutination was observed in controls with BSA. Dose-and Ca 2+ -dependant agglutinations were observed for all bacteria used in this study, where increased levels of Millectininduced increased levels of agglutination and addition of EDTA disrupted the agglutination capabilities. Subsequent additions of excess calcium restored the agglutination ( Figure 5 ). As Symbiodinium normally forms clumps (autoagglutinates) in vitro, agglutination assays were not appropriate to assess the binding of Millectin to Symbiodinium. We therefore used fluorescence microscopy to examine binding of biotinylated and FITC-conjugated purified Millectin to a variety of Symbiodinium types and found that it binds to cultured, axenic Symbiodinium types C1, C2 and A2 when in the presence of calcium ( Figure 6) . No binding was observed in controls using BSA. ",

In doing so, we have isolated and identified a PRR that is of interest from a range of perspectives including a potential role in symbiosis, diversity in invertebrate immune receptors and the evolution of players in the innate immune system. Millectin is homologous to the lectin domain of a range of C-type lectins involved in immunity in other animals. These include vertebrate CD23, SP-A, mannose receptor, DC-SIGN and MBL where the latter four recognise a range of viruses, bacteria, fungi and protists [14, 16, 32] and CD23 binds IgE, functioning as a cytokine and mediator of inflammation [33] . Millectin, in common with several of its homologues, has a conserved carbohydrate-binding site (EPN) in position 158-160, which confers specificity predominantly for mannose and similar carbohydrates such as fucose, N-acetylglucosamine and glucose [17, 34] , and shows Ca 2+ dependency in common with many C-type lectins [15] . Electrophoretic separation of native Millectin indicated that the mature protein consists of trimers, similar to the basic trimeric or multiple trimer configurations observed in CD23, SP-A and vertebrate mannan-binding lectin [32, 35, 36] . Further, phylogenetic analysis indicates that Millectin is closely related to two members of the collectin family, vertebrate MBL and SP-A, which are both vital first lines of defence in innate and adaptive immune responses [14, 32] . Based on these analyses, we propose that Millectin, MBL and SP-A are a conserved group of PRRs that evolved from a proto-MBL gene that was present in the last common ancestor to cnidarians and bilaterians. The suggested relationship between these molecules is further supported by similarities in binding targets, oligomeric structure, function and presumptive tertiary structure as discussed in this paper. Millectin appears to lack the collagen component characteristic of higher vertebrate collectins, as has been observed in a urochordate ascidian MBL-like protein, lending further support to the suggestion that the collagen structure evolved specifically in vertebrates [37] . The ascidian lectin interacts with complement factor C3 in a primitive complement system [38] and, hence, warrants further investigations on the interactions of Millectin and a recently discovered C3 in coral [19, 20] .",

Mucus that is secreted by and surrounds corals is a microbe-rich environment with high densities of a diverse range of bacterial groups [39] . Therefore, corals are likely to have evolved an effective defence against obligate or opportunistic pathogens, presumably using PRRs to recognise microbes. We found that Millectin bound to and agglutinated both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including the coral pathogen V. coralliilyticus, indicative of multivalent cell surface binding properties to non-self structures. The ability to bind and immobilise a variety of bacteria, including those implicated in disease, shows Millectin is a functional PRR in the coral immune system. By binding and agglutinating potential invaders, Millectin has the potential to prevent movement and dispersal of the pathogen through the host and enable opsonisation (i.e. targeting) for phagocytosis and destruction [5] .",

                "text": "Despite the vast bacterial communities associated with corals, the most studied of the coral-associated microbes remains the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium, which resides within a vacuolar membrane inside the gastrodermal cells of the coral. Through photosynthesis, they contribute the majority of the host's energy requirements [40] . This beneficial, yet pervasive endosymbiotic mutualism provides the energy required for the accretion of calcium carbonate skeletons of corals and hence the framework of coral reefs. As many corals must acquire new symbionts from the environment at each generation, mechanisms must exist for the identification and targeting of Symbiodinium for phagocytosis from the surrounding seawater [41] . C-type lectins have previously been shown to play a role in harvesting microbial symbionts. For example, in the marine nematode Laxus oneistus, the DC-SIGN-like protein Mermaid is secreted into the cuticle mucus layer, where it mediates bacterial symbiont acquisition by binding and agglutination [6] . Although there is no direct evidence that C-type lectins are involved in phagocytosis of Symbiodinium, it appears that lectin/glycan interactions mediate symbiont uptake in corals [42] . We used fluorescence microscopy to examine binding of biotinylated and FITC-conjugated purified Millectin to a variety of Symbiodinium types and found that it binds to cultured, axenic Symbiodinium types C1, C2 and A2 when in the presence of calcium. Two major functions of the relatives to Millectin are agglutination and opsonisation, and the coating of Symbiodinium by Millectin is essentially identical to the binding of opsonins to targets destined for phagocytosis. As Millectin contains a signal peptide for extracellular secretion, we propose that the protein is secreted into the mucus layer coating the surface and gut of corals, where it binds non-self mannan structures on both symbionts and pathogens causing agglutination and immobilisation of microbes, and binding and opsonisation of symbionts or bacteria that are destined to be phagocytosed. The onset of symbiosis is mediated by selection processes occurring both before and after phagocytosis [7] and we suggest that an ancient role of C-type lectins in the innate immune response has been co-opted into the pathway that leads to the uptake of Symbiodinium by corals. Unknown signalling cascades downstream of the phagocytosis event may then determine whether the Symbiodinium type takes up residence in the coral cell or not. The inability to identify specific genes involved in coral/dinoflagellate symbiosis [43] is compatible with our proposal that this pathway evolved by co-opting existing genes and pathways into this novel role.",

                "text": "Putative PRRs, such as Dscam, FREP, PGRPs and SRCR, have been identified in a range of invertebrates, where they show high-sequence diversity resulting from alternative splicing or expanded gene families [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . It has been hypothesised that this variability functions as an alternative adaptive immune system in invertebrates allowing for rapid diversification of the innate immune system in order to compete with evolutionary changes of pathogen surfaces No substitutions are observed in the highly conserved C-type lectin residues (boxed) or in predicted mannose and calcium-binding sites (denoted by dots below residue). Sequence variation in a predicted glycosylation site (underlined), is assumed to result in non-glycosylated and glycosylated isoforms. (b), PyMOL 3D view of the C-type lectin domain of resolved MBL (PDB; 1msb, left) and predicted Millectin (right) modelled upon PDB structure 1t8c. Blue sticks show the mannosebinding site (EPN) and additional known or predicted calcium-binding sites. Regions highlighted in red in the Millectin model indicate the positions of amino acid variation seen in (a) for the C-type lectin domain, and show that variation only occurs in the loops of the predicted model. [13] . Small changes in the primary amino acid sequence of the carbohydrate-binding region in lectins can significantly alter the affinity and specificity of the target [34] and, interestingly, we discovered 13 distinct isoforms of Millectin when we sequenced 84 clones from a cDNA library derived from mRNA from a single individual. The positions of these amino acid substitutions were highly conserved, suggesting the variations were not due to sequencing or cloning errors. Comparisons of the resolved structure of the C-type lectin domain of rat MBL and a 3D prediction model of Millectin reveal similarities in folding and areas of carbohydrate binding. The Millectin model indicated that the majority of the substitutions appear in areas in close proximity to the carbohydrate-binding site. The C-type lectin fold has been shown to tolerate extensive sequence variation without altering the overall fold of the domain, permitting substitutions in non-structural segments [46] . In line with this, all the sequence variation in the C-type lectin fold of Millectin occurs in the loops and not in the helical structures or b-sheets that create the backbone of the lectin fold. In addition, no amino acid substitutions occur in any of the conserved structural motifs such as the calcium-or mannose-binding sites, suggesting these functions remain intact in all isoforms. Whilst MBL in vertebrates has evolved to participate in processes involving the adaptive immune system, we suggest that Millectin has diversified its binding repertoire to distinguish non-self organisms, including that of pathogens and symbionts. The diversification of Millectin may simultaneously increase the efficiency of the innate immune system and extend this process to include symbiont acquisition. Millectin is the first mannose-binding lectin shown to contain extensive sequence variation, as observed in other invertebrate PRRs. Although we have only discovered 13 variants of Millectin, far fewer than the thousands of isoforms suggested for Dscam, Millectin assumes a trimeric configuration that would generate a considerable amount of diversity with over 2000 possible multimeric variations, if all possible combinations were utilised.",

The presence of a functional mannose-binding lectin in coral indicates that this gene family predates the divergence of cnidarians and bilaterians and suggests that MBLs have an ancient and well-conserved role in eumetazoan innate immunity. The sequence diversity in the binding region reflects the ability of Millectin to recognise and bind a range of exogenous organisms, including beneficial symbionts. Our findings suggest that Millectin has multiple functions, co-opted from the innate immune system to fulfil key roles in both immunity and symbiont acquisition. The relationship between these two functions is intriguing, as the phenomena of coral disease and bleaching events becomes increasingly significant to the health of coral reefs around the world.",

Agglutination (clumping of cells) is indicative of binding of Millectin to cells surfaces and is evident in samples containing 50 mg ml \u00c01 Millectin and bacteria with an OD of 1: (a), B. licheniformis; (b), V. coralliilyticus; (c), S. iniae and (h) and (i), V. harveyi. Corresponding controls with bacteria (OD 600 of 1) and 50 mg ml \u00c01 bovine serum albumin (BSA) show no agglutination: (d), B. licheniformis; (e), V. coralliilyticus; (f), S. iniae and (j), V. harveyi. Representative figures of dose-dependant agglutination are shown in (g), V. harveyi with 10 mg ml \u00c01 of Millectin and (h), V. harveyi with 50 mg ml \u00c01 of Millectin showing increased agglutination. Magnification on (h) is shown in (i). Representative example of Ca 2+ -dependant agglutination is shown in (k), where addition of 1 mM EDTA to V. harveyi (OD 600 of 1) with mg ml \u00c01 of Millectin prevents agglutination and (l), subsequent addition of excess calcium (20 mM Ca 2+ ) to sample shown in (k) restores agglutination. All figures are representative photos from repeated experiments with consistent results. Scalebars are 20 mm.",

In 2000, populations of Montastraea annularis at four sites near Molasses Reef within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and one reef within Biscayne National Park were sampled on a quarterly basis. Anecdotal observations showed corals at Alina\u00d5s Reef in Biscayne National Park appeared healthy in March, but experienced an acute loss of coral cover by August. Cellular Diagnostic analysis indicated that Alina\u00d5s Reef corals were in distress: they had been afflicted with a severe oxidative damaging and protein-denaturing stress that affected both the corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. This condition was associated with a significant xenobiotic detoxification response in both species, reflecting probable chemical contaminant exposure. These results demonstrate that applying a Cellular Diagnostic approach can be effective in helping to identify stress and its underlying causes, providing diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of coral health.",

Recent reports indicate that 58-70% of coral reefs worldwide are directly threatened by human-associated activities, while over 80% of the Caribbean coral-reef cover has disappeared in the last years (Bryant and Burke, 1998; Wilkinson, 1999; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Goreau et al., 2000; Gardner et al., 2003) . Coral reef communities experiencing persistent environmental disturbances (e.g., coastal development and land-based pollution) are undergoing changes that lead to a loss of coral diversity, increased incidence of disease, reduced growth, reduced reproduction, and mass mortality (Richmond, 1993; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Nystrom et al., 2000; Knowlton, 2001; Porter and Tougas, 2001; Patterson et al., 2002; CRMP, 2001) . From 1996 to 2000, a time span that included a major El Ni\u00f1 o event, corals in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary lost a record 38% of their living coral cover (CRMP, 2001;  0025-326X/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

If declines are caused solely by global factors, there may be little resource managers can do to immediately ameliorate the problem. However, if local (defined as a restricted region of about 50 km) factors contribute to coral declines, resource managers may be able to respond with mitigation efforts. For example, if urban effluent is the principle stressor, discharges can be managed and regulated. Unfortunately, conventional coral monitoring and mapping protocols have had limited success in demonstrating the causes of coral reef declines in the Florida Keys and elsewhere (Pennisi, 2002; Vasseur and Cossu-Leguille, 2003) . Most monitoring programs were designed to establish baseline conditions and determine trends, not to identify sources of stress (Risk, 1999) . The inability of coral monitoring programs to pinpoint factors affecting local reef declines makes it difficult for resource managers to effectively manage coral reefs (Jameson et al., 2001 (Jameson et al., , 2002 Downs et al., 2005) .",

We recently developed a novel biotechnology that employs a suite of diagnostic indicators to assess the cellular-physiological condition of reef-building corals (Downs et al., 2000 (Downs et al., , 2002a Brown et al., 2002a; Woodley et al., 2002; Fauth et al., 2003; Downs, 2005) . Cellular Diagnostics focuses a comprehensive array of biotechnologies to diagnose population health, and was tailored to determine coral-health condition and help identify mechanisms of coral pathologies (Downs et al., 2000 (Downs et al., , 2002a Brown et al., 2002a; Woodley et al., 2002;  Table 1 ). Cellular Diagnostics is used to measure changes in cellular parameters, allowing: (1) assessment of cellular-physiological condition of an individual or population, (2) identification of putative stressors, either by direct measurement of the stressor or by profiling stressor-specific effects, and (3) forecasting higher-order behavior based on an understanding of cellular-level processes (Downs, 2005) . Parameters that are measured as part of a cellular diagnosis include membrane integrity and composition, anti-oxidant redox status, protein metabolic condition, xenobiotic detoxification pathways, intra-cellular metal regulation, and genomic integrity. Cellular Diagnostics provides a new approach to environmental-health assessment, based on concepts and methodologies already used in medical diagnostics and epidemiology (Downs, 2005) .",

Chaperones regulate protein structure and function under normal physiological conditions as well as during and following stress by renaturing denatured proteins into active states in an ATP-dependent manner. Both Hsp60 and Hsp70 are ubiquitous chaperonins found in all phyla of life and are essential components for cellular function, during both normal and stressed conditions. Furthermore, mitochondrial and chloroplastic Hsp60 and Hsp70 homologues work in concert--an essential multi-step pathway for correct conformation of protein structure. Hsp60 and Hsp70 levels increase in response to stress, specifically in response to increased protein synthesis and denaturation Invertebrate small heat-shock proteins (sHsp = total small heat-shock protein isoforms)--aB-crystallin, Hsp22, Hsp23, Hsp26, and Hsp28 share domains of common homology to one another, but have different cellular functions. In cnidarians, as many as 5-6 major sHsp isoforms exist (Downs et al., 2000) . Small Hsps from all phyla share a common motif near the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein, known as the ''heat-shock domain'' or a-crystallin domain. Other areas of these proteins are not homologous and are specific to the sub-family of sHsps. In most cases, the small heat-shock proteins are not present during optimal growing conditions and are only elicited by stress. aB-crystallin is a small heat-shock protein found only in the cytosol of animals, where it protects cytoskeletal elements during stress (Derham and Harding, 1999) . Thus, the presence and concentration of different small heat-shock proteins reflects the physiological status of several metabolic and structural pathways in the cell Chloroplast small heat-shock protein (Chlp sHsp) A member of the small heat-shock protein family found only in plants. This protein functions to protect Photosystem II activity, specifically the oxygen evolving complex, during photooxidative conditions.

Increases in ubiquitin levels are an indication of increased levels of protein degradation, and hence, increased protein turnover. Consequently, to compensate for decreased functional protein levels due to stress, the cell will increase production of these same proteins.

A band was not detectable in the western blot for the invertebrate sHsp, but this is not unusual since only a severely stressed coral will exhibit this protein at a western blot detectable level (Downs et al., 2000) .",

Basal levels of this protein through the year in corals from sites 1-4 near Molasses Reef averaged 0.075 EU/ng TSP (Fig.  5 ). Levels of this protein at Alina\u00d5s Reef in March were over twice this (Welch ANOVA, p < 0.001), indicating that PSII was severely stressed, if not damaged. Chloroplast sHsp levels then decreased to basal levels in June and remained there for the remainder of the year. Cnidarian sHsps had a similar pattern (Fig. 5) , with cnidarian sHsp levels at Alina\u00d5s Reef in March almost double the levels at the other sites through the year (Welch ANOVA, p < 0.001), but then decreasing significantly in June to levels comparable to seen at the other sites. The sHsp22 is localized to the mitochondria in cnidarians and other invertebrates and is thought to protect aspects of respiration, specifically oxidative phosphorylation (Morrow et al., 2000) .

Elevation of both MnSODs suggests that the unknown stressor is affecting the mitochondria in both species. Both cnidarian and dinoflagellate GPx levels were significantly increased in March at Alina\u00d5s Reef (ANOVA, p > 0.001) but, as in the case of the MnSODs, decreased in accumulation in June through November, although these were still higher than GPx levels at Sites 1-4 (p < 0.001), Fig. 6 .

Based on the proximity of Ali-na\u00d5s Reef to a number of anthropogenic activities (e.g. nuclear power plant, South Florida Water Management Canals, agricultural runoff, Dade County Landfill, City of Miami) we hypothesised that the localized stressor may be a chemical xenobiotic. To test this hypothesis, we examined three cellular parameters that would be significantly modulated by a xenobiotic: cnidarian GST, dinoflagellate GST, and the P-glycoprotein 180 homologue (multixenobiotic resistance protein, MXR-MDR), from both species. Cnidarian GST levels were significantly elevated in March at Alina\u00d5s Reef (Welch ANOVA, p < 0.001), and continued to be significantly elevated (Welch ANOVA, p < 0.01), Fig. 7 . Dinoflagellate GST was elevated at Alina\u00d5s Reef in March, as well as the rest of the year, but this elevation was not as pronounced as the cnidarian GST (Welch ANOVA, p < 0.001), Fig. 7 . Multixenobiotic resistance protein, MXR-MDR, is an ABC cassette protein that lowers the intracellular concentration of toxic compounds below their level of toxicity (Bard, 2000) . Increase of this protein is usually only in response to an organic xenobiotic (Bard, 2000; Sauna et al., 2001 ). Unfortunately, this antibody binds both the cnidarian and dinoflagellate isoforms, hence results are a composite of MDR expression in both. MDR levels were significantly elevated in March at Alina\u00d5s Reef above all other sites at all time points (Welch ANOVA, p < 0.001), Fig. 7 . MDR levels at Alina\u00d5s Reef decreased in June and were not significantly different than MDR levels Sites 1-4 throughout the rest of the year.",

The significant difference in coral biomarker levels between Alina\u00d5s Reef and Sites 1-4, coupled with field observations, suggests that the coral decline observed in the Upper Keys may be related to local factors rather than large climatic actions (e.g. El Nino). Though we are able to ascertain that the localized stressor induces an oxidative stress, is disruptive to mitochondrial \u00d4nominal\u00d5 equilibrium, and elicits a strong xenobiotic detoxification response, the exact identification of the stressor remains unknown. The inability to more accurately identify the stressor could be alleviated by increasing the scope of the cellular biomarkers in corals, and by contaminant/chemistry analysis. For example, assays for cnidarian metallothioneins, cnidarian methyl arsenic reductases, dinoflagellate sulfate permease, dinoflagellate nitrate reductase, and dinoflagellate calcium-dependent alkaline phosphatase could be developed to aid in deducing the identity profile of the stressor(s). Alternatively, assays for chemical compound adducts with DNA or protein could be developed to not only identify the agent, but also establish that it is having a direct biological effect (Downs et al., 2002b) . Environmental chemistry analysis, along with contaminant analysis (e.g., endosulfan, atrazine, mercury, etc.), would tremendously increase the power in determining stressor identity from among a number of potential suspects. Laboratory toxicological studies (e.g. Downs et al., 2000; Downs, 2005; Hawkridge et al., 2005) may provide further corroborating evidence as to the identity of the putative stressor, especially since the coral samples have been archived and can be analyzed with new assays as they are developed.",

Further development of cellular diagnostics for coral health assessment and their integration with other disciplines represents a powerful tool for (a) providing resource managers valuable information as to the health condition of specific coral reefs and (b) providing evidence concerning the identity of putative stressors, allowing the development of defensable mitigation strategies (Downs et al., 2005) . The approach also potentially allows the fate of coral reefs to be forecasted in light of stress events. In this regard, good prognostic markers for morbidity/mortality are those that are usually directly associated with cellular damage. Protein carbonyl, lipid peroxidation products, and DNA damage products have been demonstrated as good prognostic indicators for corals, while stress defense proteins and solutes have demonstrated value as indicators of stress susceptibility (Downs et al., 2002a; Fauth et al., 2003) . Further development of cellular biomarkers in corals and other coral reef species could greatly enhance the ability of resource managers to make ecological forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Coral calcification is dependent on both the supply of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the upregulation of pH in the calcifying fluid (cf). Using geochemical proxies (\u03b4 11 B, B/Ca, Sr/Ca, Li/Mg), we show seasonal changes in the pH cf and DIC cf for Acropora yongei and Pocillopora damicornis growing insitu at Rottnest Island (32\u00b0S) in Western Australia. Changes in pH cf range from 8.38 in summer to 8.60 in winter, while DIC cf is 25 to 30% higher during summer compared to winter (\u00d71.5 to \u00d72 seawater). Thus, both variables are up-regulated well above seawater values and are seasonally out of phase with one another. The net effect of this counter-cyclical behaviour between DIC cf and pH cf is that the aragonite saturation state of the calcifying fluid (\u03a9 cf) is elevated ~4 times above seawater values and is ~25 to 40% higher during winter compared to summer. Thus, these corals control the chemical composition of the calcifying fluid to help sustain near-constant year-round calcification rates, despite a seasonal seawater temperature range from just ~19\u00b0 to 24 \u00b0C. The ability of corals to up-regulate \u03a9 cf is a key mechanism to optimise biomineralization, and is thus critical for the future of coral calcification under high CO 2 conditions. Coral reefs face an uncertain future due to increasing seawater temperatures and ocean acidification resulting from CO 2-driven climate change 1,2. Rising ocean temperatures are expected to lead to more frequent mass coral bleaching events, defined as a loss of the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) from the coral host 3-5. While corals have demonstrated the capacity to adapt to long-term changes in climate, they are still extremely vulnerable to abrupt warming events (i.e., weeks to months) as evident, for example, by the mass bleaching events that often follow El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) driven warming events 6,7. Additionally, evidence suggests 8-10 that declining seawater pH will cause the growth rates of important marine calcifiers, such as hermatypic corals, to slow down. The effect of declining pH on the calcification process is however still in question, as corals possess the physiological mechanisms to partially resist or limit the effects of ocean acidification on the bio-calcification process 11-16. They accomplish this through the up-regulation of the pH of the calcifying fluid (pH cf); a process that likely occurs via active ionic exchange of Ca 2+ with H + via Ca-ATPase 17,18 'pumps' at the site of calcification 11-16. This in turn helps to elevate the aragonite saturation state in the calcifying fluid (\u03a9 cf), a key requirement for the formation of their calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) skeletons 11-16,19,20. In addition to up-regulating pH cf , corals supply the calcifying fluid with metabolically generated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) 18. This raises the activity of carbonate ions within the calcifying fluid ([CO 2\u2212 ] cf) and, therefore, increases \u03a9 cf 21. Thus, corals manipulate rates of aragonite precipitation by actively elevating both pH cf and DIC cf 21. Despite the importance of internal carbonate chemistry in determining rates of mineral precipitation, temperature is still the main factor influencing the rates of coral growth 22-24. This is due to both the strong temperature-dependent rate kinetics of aragonite precipitation as well as the sensitivity of coral physiology to extremes in temperature 6,26. For example, calcification rates in tropical corals are generally thought to follow a Gaussian-shaped curve whereby calcification increases as temperature increases until an optimum is reached; after this maximum, rates decline with increasing temperature 7,24,27. Light is also an important driver of coral calcification on both diurnal and seasonal timescales, with rates of carbon fixation by the zooxanthellae",

The authors suggested that this uncharacteristic seasonal pattern in calcification rates was due to increased nutrient uptake in winter [36] [37] [38] and/or a possible sub-lethal stress response in summer 36, 39 . Another possibility, which is explored herein, is that corals physiologically manipulate the chemistry of their calcifying fluid to enhance rates of calcification. Earlier studies have demonstrated that the biological mediation of pH up-regulation can modulate rates of calcification 11, 13, 14, 16 . However, our ability to infer both aspects of the carbonate chemistry (i.e., pH and DIC) under in-situ conditions has only recently become possible via measuring the boron isotopic composition (\u03b4 11 B) [40] [41] [42] and elemental abundance of boron (B/Ca) 43 in coral skeletons. Furthermore, while other methods of interrogating the carbonate chemistry of the calcifying fluid have been developed and provide some informative results 14, 15, 19, 28, 44 , they generally must be conducted under tightly constrained laboratory conditions that differ greatly from the in-situ 'natural' reef habitats in which corals grow. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown that estimates of internal coral pH cf derived from geochemical tracers 12, 13, 40, 45 are consistent with more direct measurements 14, 19, 44 , affirming that boron isotopes are providing unbiased measurements of pH at the site of calcification. With these new developments 12, 21, 40, 45 , we can now determine how the carbonate chemistry of the calcifying fluid (pH cf , DIC cf , \u03a9 cf ) responds to natural and seasonally varying changes in light, temperature and seawater pH. We show that quantifying these relationships is critical to understanding and predicting how coral growth will respond to man-made climate change under real-world conditions.",

The ability to infer coral pH cf from \u03b4 11 B isotopic measurements is supported by measurements from microelectrodes 19, 28 and pH-sensitive dyes 13, 14, 46 . For example, previous studies 13, 14 have shown that pH cf up-regulation is ~0.6 to 2 units above seawater values in the light. Results from \u03b4 11 B-derived pH cf generally fall within this range and are broadly consistent 46 with these measurements (~0.3 to 0.6 pH units above seawater) [11] [12] [13] 16, 20 , given that they are integrated over multiple weeks of biomineralization. Additional variability between methods (i.e., geochemical proxies and direct measurements) may also result from the different species used and the conditions under which the measurements are conducted . More recent, albeit limited, measurements of the carbonate ion concentration using microelectrodes report values of to 1550 \u00b5mol kg \u22121 in the calcifying fluid 44 . These instantaneous measurements performed under laboratory conditions, while providing some informative results, have significant limitations. For instance, microelectrode measurements are currently unable to determine the dynamic seasonal interactions between components of the coral calcifying fluid carbonate chemistry (pH cf , DIC cf , \u03a9 cf ) documented here under naturally fluctuating conditions. This is due to the limitations of existing technology, as measurements must be conducted using separate probes for pH cf and [CO 2\u2212 ] cf and under highly controlled laboratory conditions. Thus, our findings highlight the importance of \u03b4 11 B and B/Ca proxies as a method for inferring the internal carbonate chemistry in corals under real-world conditions and over longer (i.e., seasonal) time scales.",

Thus, according to the results of those experiments, seasonal changes in coral pH cf should have been on the order of ~0.02 pH units, due to the relatively small seasonal variability in pH sw at Rottnest Island (~0.07; Supplementary Fig. S2 ). In contrast, seasonal variations in pH cf are an order of magnitude higher (>0.2 pH units). Therefore, our results unequivocally demonstrate that seawater pH is not the major factor driving seasonal changes in coral pH cf up-regulation in this study. Our current understanding of the sensitivity of the calcifying fluid chemical composition to changes in seawater carbonate chemistry has generally been inferred from controlled laboratory experiments 14, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] , which have kept other environmental conditions constant, such as temperature 14, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] and/or light 14, 50, 51 . However, our findings demonstrate that other environmental factors beyond pH sw may have a much larger influence on pH cf and [CO 3",

For instance, the observed inverse relationship between seasonally varying pH cf and DIC cf is suggestive of a deliberate mechanism to compensate for seasonal declines in temperature and light, and thus changes to the supply and/or transport of DIC necessary for coral growth 21 . The lower levels of DIC in the calcifying fluid during winter reflect a reduction in rates of carbon fixation by endosymbionts in winter and are compensated for by higher pH cf up-regulation (Fig. 3) . Despite the stabilizing effects that a counter-cyclical seasonal relationship between pH cf and DIC cf would have on \u03a9 cf , we nonetheless show that \u03a9 cf also varies seasonally.

In this model, aragonite precipitation occurs according to abiotic rate kinetics under chemical conditions dictated by the living coral (e.g., elevated pH cf and DIC cf ). Three scenarios are considered: (1) temperature and \u03a9 cf vary with season, (2) temperature, DIC cf and \u03a9 cf vary with season while pH cf is calculated based on seawater pH sw in accordance with the results of fixed aquaria experiments 40, 49 , and (3) \u03a9 cf varies with season, but temperature is kept constant at its annual average (21.7 \u00b0C). Modelled rates of calcification based on inorganic rate kinetics are a factor of 2 to 7 times lower than the measured calcification rates (see Supplementary Table S4 ). This indicates that an estimated \u03a9 cf of 30 to 50 is required to attain the measured rates of calcification and thus much higher than our seasonal range of ~10 to 16, depending on taxa (Fig. 3d) . Thus, physiological mechanisms must be operative in enhancing rates of skeletal precipitation relative to that expected from inorganic rate kinetics.",

While the estimated calcification rates from inorganic rate kinetics in scenario 1 are still ~50% higher at the peak in summer compared to the minima in winter, this seasonal change is nevertheless substantially less than the estimated ~90% seasonal change in calcification rates if pH cf levels were more or less constant year-round, as inferred from fixed condition aquaria experiments. Calcification rates estimated from both scenarios indicate that the seasonal variation in the measured coral calcification rates should be pro-cyclical with temperature and much greater than observed 36 (Fig. 5) . Thus, scenarios 1 and 2, which allow for the full seasonal variation in temperature to be expressed through the inorganic rate kinetics, exhibit large deviations from the ). There is a strong physiological control over \u03a9 cf such that calcification rates appear to be modulated more by \u03a9 cf , rather than temperature directly. We find that the calcification rates modelled under a constant mean temperature (i.e., scenario 3) show the best fit to the observed seasonal patterns in calcification (RMSE = 11.5% and 20.8%, respectively; Fig. 5 ). One possibility is that differences between the complex skeletal micro-architecture of coral growth (e.g., a higher active surface area on which precipitation can occur) 15 compared to abiotic aragonite crystal formation could result in the enhanced rates of biologically-mediated coral calcification shown here. Another possibility is that other factors may influence seasonal patterns in rates of calcification, for example, changes in the speed at which the corals create organic matrices and crystal templates [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] necessary for mineralization. This cannot be ruled out given that the calcification rate measurements are integrated over several weeks of biomineralization.",

These studies were conducted across a range of locations (i.e., spanning 10 degrees latitude) in Western Australia, and are thus widely applicable to reef-building corals growing in a various environments. There have been a number of hypotheses to explain this lack of seasonality, ranging from the residual effects of sub-lethal thermal stress following an unusually strong marine heat wave 39 , to higher rates of particulate nutrient uptake in winter 36, 37, 57 . In the present study, however, the limited seasonal variability in calcification rates can be explained by the seasonally counter-cyclical up-regulation of pH cf and DIC cf to deliberately elevate \u03a9 cf and support near-constant rates of calcification year-round, despite much cooler temperatures during winter.

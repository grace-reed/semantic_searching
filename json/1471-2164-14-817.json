    "abstract": "Background: Warmer seawater as a result of climate change may impose environmental challenges for Atlantic salmon aquaculture in its southernmost geographic range. Seawater temperatures above optimal level for growth may be reached in the warmest summer weeks. Caged fish can experience temperature and low oxygen saturation stress during such episodes, raising fish welfare and productivity concerns. In this work we compare the transcriptional responses in Atlantic salmon exposed to chronic high temperature (19\u00b0C) and low oxygen saturation (4-5 mg/L) stress. Results: We used next-generation sequencing and RT-qPCR to screen for effects, and focused on growth regulation and oxidative stress in fish exposed to sub-optimal conditions. Both prolonged temperature (45 days) and low oxygen (120 days) stress had a significant negative effect on growth. The main effect of heat stress appears to be a general reduced transcriptional rate in salmon liver, while mechanisms typically associated with responses induced by chemical drugs were stimulated. Heat stress significantly down-regulated several transcripts encoding proteins involved in the protection against oxidative stress, including CuZn SOD, Mn SOD, GPx1 and GR, as well as additional stress markers HIF1A, CYP1A, MTOR and PSMC2 (RT-qPCR data). In salmon held at low oxygen concentration for four months protein ubiquitination (protein catabolism) was the most strongly affected pathway. According to the RT-qPCR data, low oxygen stress significantly up-regulated the transcriptional levels of IGFBP1B and down-regulated the levels of GR. Pathway analysis suggests that high temperature and low oxygen saturation stress affects many similar mechanisms in Atlantic salmon. Based on the gene lists, six out of the top ten predicted upstream transcriptional regulators, 1,2-dithiol-3-thione sirolimus, CD437, 5-fluorouracil, HNF4A and NFE2L2, were similar between the two treatments. Conclusions: In conclusion, temperature and low oxygen saturation stress affect many identical mechanisms in liver cells resulting in a metabolic depression, but these effects are not necessarily mediated through altered transcription of the same genes.",

                "text": "Climate change may introduce several environmental challenges for farmed fish caged in seawater pens. In temperate areas, increased seawater temperature during the summer months may represent a problem for farmed fish unable to swim to colder water. Ectothermic animals such as fish normally show temperature-dependent oxygen consumption [1] . Increasing temperatures may induce low oxygen stress since oxygen solubility is reduced in warmer water. Fish may also experience hypoxia at elevated temperatures even under conditions with unchanged oxygen tension, for example increased temperature could reduce the binding capacity of hemoglobin for oxygen transport [2, 3] . Environmental temperature affects almost all aspects of fish physiology, and effects of temperature fluctuation on teleosts have been studied extensively for decades [4] . Sedentary fish species may be exposed to stressful shortterm temperature spikes during the summer months when ambient seawater temperature changes rapidly. Metabolism in ectothermic fish is highly dependent on environmental temperature [5] , with suboptimal conditions affecting both feed intake and growth [6] . For instance, sea-caged Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), unable to escape sudden temperature bursts by vertical migration, may experience considerable challenges with temperature adaptation. In southern Norwegian fjords such temperature periods lasting a few weeks have been recorded in recent years with observed temperatures above optimal levels for locally farmed Atlantic salmon [6] , raising both fish welfare and productivity challenges.",

Both acute and chronic heat stress can induce relative large transcriptional changes in salmonids [2, 4, 7, 8] and other fish species [3, [9] [10] [11] , including in coldadapted Antarctic fish [12, 13] . Also hypothermia can induce transcriptional changes in fishes [14, 15] . Depending on studied cell type, typical responses in fish exposed to heat stress include altered transcription in genes involved in protein processing, transcription and cell growth [9] , protein folding and heat shock proteins [2, 8, 10, 11] , cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and proteolytic protein degradation [11] , \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor genes [12, 13] , acute inflammatory response [12] , and ribosomal genes and catabolism, i.e. metabolism [7, 16] . Although oxidative stress response has been reported as one of the strongest affected mechanisms in fish exposed to acute temperature stress according to global genome screening [12] , surprisingly few of these studies have reported large transcriptional changes in genes associated with the antioxidative defense.",

Consequences of low dissolved oxygen are often sublethal and affect growth, immune responses and reproduction [18] . For Atlantic salmon, oxygen levels falling below the critical point of 6 mg/L are considering hypoxic [19] . In one of the first microarray screening studies with fish, Gracey et al. [20] showed profound effects of hypoxia on the longjawed mudsucker (Gillichthys mirabilis) after 5 days of treatment. They observed effects on transcripts encoding proteins involved in protein synthesis and locomotion, as well as on genes needed for anaerobic ATP production. Studying gene expression changes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos exposed to 24 hours of hypoxia during development, Ton et al. [21] identified transcriptional changes indicating metabolic depression with a switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism and energy preservation. More recent studies have shown changes in expression of genes related to physiological adaptation to low environmental oxygen in gills of zebrafish after 21 days of hypoxia exposure [22] , effects on general metabolism, catabolism, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in brain, gill and liver of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) after 5-6 days of exposure to hypoxia [23, 24] , responses in genes involved in metabolic energy changes in brain, gill and liver of Xiphophorus maculatus after 6 days of exposure to hypoxia [25] , as well as activation of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in fin tissue of Japanese medaka after 7 days of exposure to hypoxia [26] . In gonads of zebrafish acute hypoxia for 4 and 14 days affected responses such as metabolism of carbohydrate and proteins, and reactive oxygen species metabolism, while chronic hypoxia affected lipid metabolism, steroid hormones, and immune responses [27] .",

Recent findings suggest that thermal responses of fish can be oxygen-limited [28] , indicating that oxygen-limited thermal tolerance is of major importance in the response of fish to climate change [29] . Global transcriptional responses in liver of adult Atlantic salmon exposed to high temperature (19\u00b0C) and low oxygen (4-5 mg O /L) was examined using next-generation sequencing technology. Tissue samples were obtained from two independent experiments. In the first experiment, described in detail by Hevr\u00f8y et al. [30] , Atlantic salmon was held at 13\u00b0C (optimal temperature, control), 15\u00b0C, 17\u00b0C or 19\u00b0C (heat stressed). Effects of heat stress were evaluated by comparing the transcriptional patterns in the 13\u00b0C and 19\u00b0C groups of fish using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA libraries followed by FLX 454 sequencing. In the second experiment, control fish were held at optimal oxygen (7-8 mg/L) and low oxygen stressed fish held at sub-optimal oxygen (4-5 mg/L). Effects of low oxygen were evaluated by comparing the transcriptional patterns in the two groups of fish using normalized cDNA libraries followed by FLX 454 sequencing. In total we sequenced about 1.5 million reads from four cDNA libraries, and used gene ontology and pathway analysis tools to evaluate the responses. Real-time RT-qPCR analysis was used on an extended number of fish for follow-up examination of relevant genes, including growth regulation and oxidative stress relevant genes.",

Heat stress resulted in overexpression of GOs linked to oxygen binding and transporter activity, i.e. GO:0019825 oxygen binding and GO:000534 oxygen transporter activity. Figure 2B shows differentially expressed GOs in Atlantic salmon exposed to low oxygen saturation with significance levels of P < 0.001. Many GOs linked to general metabolism were significantly affected by low oxygen saturation, suggesting a compensatory response induced by low oxygen stress. Top listed overexpressed GOs were GO:0090304 nucleic acid metabolic process, GO:0016070 RNA metabolic process and GO:0031323 regulation of cellular metabolic process, whereas GOs linked to oxygen reduction reactions such as GO:0055114 oxidation-reduction process and GO:0016491 oxidoreductase activity were underexpressed. All significant over-or underexpressed GOs, including IDs and terms, P-values, and the number of transcripts associated with a specific GO term from the cDNA libraries, as determined by Fisher's Exact Test, are shown in Additional file 3. From the temperature stress experiment, enriched GOs are shown in the Additional file 3, worksheet A. Form the low oxygen experiment, we list GO enrichment analyses data both for contigs only consisting of more than 50 reads (>50 reads) (worksheet B) and by using all large contigs (worksheet C). According to the latter analysis, GOs linked to lipid metabolism were underexpressed in salmon held at low oxygen saturation, with GO:0006629 lipid metabolic process and GO:0006631 fatty acid metabolic process being most significant. In total, by also including contigs with less than 50 reads, fewer significant GOs were found (133 versus 266). The larger dataset however appears to provide more specific GOs than by using only contigs consisting of >50 reads.",

                "text": "A gene list consisting of 1066 identifiers recognized by IPA from the temperature stress experiment was used for pathway analysis. The list was generated by considering all the genes in the forward SSH cDNA library as being up-regulated by temperature stress and given a foldchange score of 2, and all the genes in the reverse SSH cDNA library as being down-regulated by temperature stress and given a fold-change score of -2. IPA analysis for temperature stress genes revealed seven top networks, \"Protein Synthesis, Gene Expression, Cancer\" (score 53) ( Figure 3A) , \"RNA Post-Transcriptional Modification, Gene Expression, Protein Synthesis\" (score 48), \"DNA Replication, Recombination, and Repair, Energy Production, Nucleic Acid Metabolism\" (score 37), \"Hematological Disease, Metabolic Disease, Nutritional Disease\" (score 36) ( Figure 3B ), \"Gene Expression, Protein Synthesis, Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction\" (score 36), \"Drug Metabolism, Protein Synthesis, Glutathione Depletion In Liver\" (score 30) ( Figure 3C) , and \"Free Radical Scavenging, Lipid Metabolism, Molecular Transport\" (rank 7, score 28) ( Figure 3D ). Top canonical pathways were \"EIF2 Signaling\" (P-value 1,03E-55, ratio 62/200 (0,31)), \"Acute Phase Response Signaling\" (P-value 1,11E-22, ratio 34/179 (0,19)), \"Regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K Signaling\" (P-value 5,74E-20, ratio 30/17 5 (0,171)), \"mTOR Signaling\" (P-value 1,32E-17, ratio 31/211 (0,147)), and \"Mitochondrial Dysfunction\" (P-value 9,3E-17, ratio 28/186 (0,151)). IPA Upstream Regulator analytic aim to identify the cascade of upstream transcriptional regulators that can explain the observed gene expression changes in the dataset, and help illuminate the biological activities occurring in the tissues or cells being studied. IPA analysis suggested that \"1,2-dithiol-3-thione\" (P-value 6,49E-08), \"sirolimus\" (P-value 2,50E-07), \"pirinixic acid\" (P-value 2,80E-07), \"CD 437\" (P-value 3,64E-07), and \"5-fluorouracil\" (P-value 3,93E-06) to be the top upstream regulators. Additional file 4 shows the predicted upstream regulators of temperature stress in Atlantic salmon liver with an overlap P-value higher than 10E-05 (worksheet \"Temperature\"). IPA-Tox analysis generates a focused toxicity and safety assessment of chemical compounds using toxicogenomics approaches, but can also be used to assess molecular perturbation of all kinds of environmental stressors, i.e. temperature and low oxygen. From the temperature stress The IPA Compare function was used to find transcripts solely expressed in the low oxygen group and not in the normal oxygen group, creating a list consisting of 221 genes with positive IPA identifiers. According to the IPA Core analysis, the top three affected networks solely expressed in the low oxygen group were \"Lipid Metabolism, Small Molecule Biochemistry, Dermatological Diseases and Conditions\" (score 77), \"Nucleic Acid Metabolism, Small Molecule Biochemistry, Organ Morphology\" (score 33) and \"Hereditary Disorder, Metabolic Disease, Cardiovascular Disease\" (score 33). Figure 4 shows the second highest scored IPA Core Analysis network by using gene identifiers unique for the low oxygen group. This network, \"Nucleic acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, organ morphology\", includes the hif1a gene in a central position, suggesting a link to hypoxia. The top canonical pathway, \"Protein Ubiquitination Pathway\", had a P-value of 8,68E-05 and a ratio of 11/268 (0,041). According to the IPA Core analysis \"1,2-dithiol-3-thione\" (P-value 6,49E-08), \"sirolimus\" (P-value 2,50E-07), \"pirinixic acid\" (P-value 2,80E-07), \"CD 437\" (P-value 3,64E-07) and \"5fluorouracil\" (P-value 3,93E-06) were the top upstream regulators. Additional file 4 lists the predicted upstream regulators of low oxygen stress in Atlantic salmon liver with an overlap P-value higher than 10E-03 (worksheet \"Hypoxia\"). Activation z-scores from the low oxygen experiment were not possible to calculate since we did not have any fold-change input. Low oxygen exposure induced the following effects according to the IPA-Tox analysis, \"Glutathione Depletion -Phase II Reactions\" (P-value 1,11E-03, ratio 3/20 (0,15)), \"Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Signaling\" (P-value 6,08E-03, ratio 4/70 (0,057)), Cholesterol Biosynthesis (P-value 1,17E-02, ratio 2/16 (0,125)), Cytochrome P450 Panel -Substrate is a Xenobiotic (Human) (P-value 1,64E-02, ratio 2/19 (0,105)) and Mitochondrial Dysfunction (P-value 2,03E-02, ratio 5/150 (0,033)).",

                "text": "From the temperatures stress experiment, transcriptional levels of 12 target genes were determined with RT-qPCR in liver of adult salmon from 36 individual fish kept at four different temperatures (13\u00b0C, 15\u00b0C, 17\u00b0C and 19\u00b0C) for 45 days. Markers of oxidative stress (CuZn SOD, Mn SOD, CAT, GPx1 and GR), hypoxia (HIF1A), anti- growth/catabolism (IGFBP1A) and five genes (CYP1A, HSP90B, NDUFS1, MTOR and PSMC2) selected from the cDNA library gene lists ( Figure 6 ) were included for analysis. CuZn SOD showed a decreasing expression with increasing temperature, and was significantly lower expressed in liver of fish kept at 17\u00b0C and 19\u00b0C compared to the control fish kept at 13\u00b0C ( Figure 6A ). Mn SOD was significantly lower expressed in fish kept at 19\u00b0C com-pared to the fish kept at 13\u00b0C ( Figure 6B ). Significant lower expression in fish kept at the two highest temperatures compared to the control fish was also observed for GPx1 ( Figure 6D ), GR ( Figure 6E ), HIF1A ( Figure 6F ) and CYP1A ( Figure 6G ). MTOR ( Figure 6I ) and PSMC2 ( Figure 6L ) expression was significantly lower in the fish kept at 19\u00b0C compared to the 13\u00b0C control, whereas no significant effects of temperature stress were observed between the groups for CAT ( Figure 6C ), IGFBP1A ( Figure 6H ) and NDUFS1 ( Figure 6J ). Significance levels are shown in the figures. Figures 7 and 8 show the transcriptional levels of 13 genes in liver of a total of 54 individual fish obtained from the low oxygen stress experiment. The fish were collected from six treatment groups, three that were fed high-energy diets and three that were fed low-energy diets. From each dietary group fish were either kept at normoxia (control), low oxygen or pair fed. 2-way ANOVA was used to search for effects of oxygen levels and dietary energy levels. The amount of energy in the feed had a stronger effect on the transcriptional levels than oxygen saturation levels. Significant effects of feed energy were observed for CuZn SOD ( Figure 7A ), Mn SOD ( Figure 7B ), CAT ( Figure 7C ), GR ( Figure 7D ), HSP70 ( Figure 7E ), HSP90A ( Figure 7F ), CYP1A ( Figure 7H ), and PSMC2 ( Figure 8E ). Significant effects of water oxygen saturation were observed for GR ( Figure 7D ), and IGFBP1B ( Figure 8B ). Interaction effects between feed energy content and water oxygen saturation were observed for GR ( Figure 7D ), and IGFBP1B ( Figure 8B ). Only two out of the 13 evaluated genes showed a significant effect of low oxygen exposure according to the RT-qPCR data by comparing the normoxia and low oxygen groups directly (high energy and low energy feed groups combined). Hypoxic condition resulted in lowered GR transcription ( Figure 7D , t-test, P = 0.04, n = 18) and increased IGFBP1B transcription ( Figure 8B , t-test, P = 0.0049, n = 18).",

This pattern was verified with the RT-qPCR analyses. Fish held at 15\u00b0C or above had reduced growth compared to the controls. In ectoderms, abiotic factors such as temperature determine the amount of energy spent on maintenance and growth, as most biological processes, i.e. protein synthesis and degradation, are temperature dependent. At temperatures above optimal reduced growth is inevitable [5] , as recently shown in longtime elevated temperature experiments with Atlantic salmon [6, 30] . The current study shows that long-term exposure to sub-optimal oxygen saturation also has a negative effect on growth in Atlantic salmon. The growth effects of hypoxia are often explained in terms of loss of appetite and assimilation efficiency, and in terms of digestion [32] . A similar loss of appetite has been shown in large Atlantic salmon continuously exposed to 19\u00b0C [4] . At the cellular level, protein synthesis and ion-pumping through Na,K-ATPase represent key targets of hypoxia causing energy reallocation [33] . By comparing the two datasets, temperature and low oxygen stress seem to induce effects involving many similar mechanisms. However, surprisingly few of the top-ranked genes in the cDNA libraries were common between the two treatments. Only 19 contigs with similar annotation were identified as being affected both by temperature and low oxygen. This suggests that although chronic high temperature and low oxygen stress affects many identical mechanism in fish, they do not necessary invoke these effects through differential regulation of the same individual genes. The low degree of overlap may in part rely on the two different methods applied for cDNA library construction, as discussed below. In marine environments it is generally held that dissolved oxygen concentrations below 2-3 mg O 2 /L is considered hypoxic [17] . By this definition, the low oxygen stress used in the current experiment did not account as hypoxia, but for simplicity we use the \"low oxygen stress\" and \"hypoxia\" terms interchangeable throughout the discussion. In coldwater salmonids, behavioral responses to hypoxia have been detected already at 8 mg O 2 /L [34] , but dissolved Figure 8 Transcription of 12 genes determined with RT-qPCR from the low oxygen experiment.

MYCN, HNF1A, HNF4A and NFE2L2 were among the transcription regulators that were inhibited by high temperature. This finding suggests that heat stress may have had an effect on the transcriptional rate in salmon liver. At the same time, most of the upstream regulators with a predicted activated state are typically associated with responses induced by chemical drugs. Thus, the key liver transcriptional factors affected by temperature stress suggest an effect on overall transcription, while at the same time the environmental stimuli seems to induce transcription of genes most often linked to effects of toxicants. The results suggest a switch toward increased transcription of protective enzymes at the cost of synthesis of maintenance enzymes. Based on the RT-qPCR results from the heat stress study, it appears clear that liver transcription in Atlantic salmon is considerable affected at temperatures above 17\u00b0C. Of the evaluated markers for oxidative stress, four out of five genes, CuZn SOD, Mn SOD, GPx1 and GR, were lower expressed in liver of fish kept at 19\u00b0C than in fish kept at optimal temperature at 13\u00b0C, while three genes, CuZn SOD, GPx1 and GR, also showed significant lower expression in fish kept at 17\u00b0C. This could be due to reduced mitochondrial ROS production as a result of reduced overall metabolism at higher temperature, although, in general, elevated environmental temperature results in enhanced oxygen consumption and ROS production and thereby increased oxidative stress in fish [37] . High temperature mediated lower expression of several of the other evaluated genes also, including HIF1A. The only gene that showed a significant higher expression in heat-stressed fish was HSP90B. In heat stressed fish, HSP90B was positively correlated with HSP70, but this transcript showed no significant correlation with any of the other evaluated genes, as opposed to for example HIF1A, whose expression was significantly correlated with all evaluated transcripts except for the two heat shock protein transcripts HSP70 and HSP90B.",

Glutathione depletion and signaling effects possibly induced by nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)like 2 (NFE2L2) in the liver seems a likely explanation for these findings. NFE2L2 is a transcription activator that binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes important for the coordinated regulation of genes in response to oxidative stress [38] . Of the oxidative stress marker genes evaluated with RT-qPCR, only GR showed a significant effect of low oxygen treatment. GR is crucial in glutathione metabolism and maintains high levels of reduced glutathione in the cytosol. In a previous study in which Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were exposed to 46% O saturation for six weeks, we observed down-regulation of transcripts encoding CuZn SOD and GPx3 [39] . Altered regulation of genes involved in glutathione metabolism strengthens the predicted effect of hypoxia on NFE2L2 regulated oxidative stress markers. Three of the predicted five top significant upstream regulators induced by hypoxia were also among the top five most significant upstream regulators induced by temperature stress, i.e. 5-fluorouracil, CD437 and sirolimus, suggesting a partly overlapping response to the two stressors.",

                "text": "A compelling finding was that among the 19 common genes were two transcripts encoding proteins typically involved in detoxification of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), i.e. CYP1A and GSTA1. Both transcripts were higher expressed in temperature-stressed fish liver. Due to the high fat content in muscle, farmed Atlantic salmon are prone to accumulate relatively high levels of lipophilic POPs in fillet and liver [40] . One can therefore speculate that elevated temperature may have affected the storage and turnover of POPs in salmon muscle and liver, as influx and efflux rates of toxicants across membranes increase with increasing temperature [29] . In temperature-stressed salmon, lipids stored in muscle tissue are increasingly being used for maintenance energy metabolism [30] . EROD activity is temperature dependent in fish [41, 42] , so if increased EROD activity over time is followed by increased transcription, a temperature effect on CYP1A transcription might be expected. In gills of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) held at 8 or 23\u00b0C for two weeks, heat stress up-regulated several drug-metabolizing protein transcripts including phase I and II enzyme transcripts such as CYP1A, CYP1C1, UGT2B17, and xenobiotic transporter ABCG2 [43] , clearly suggesting a temperature effect on drug-metabolizing enzyme transcription in salmonids. Since both aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and HIF-1 compete for aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT), hypoxia could be expected to decrease the expression of P450 genes [44] . Indeed, in Atlantic cod exposed to 46% hypoxia for six weeks we observed CYP1A transcript down-regulation [39] . Rahman and Thomas [45] also observed a down-regulation of CYP1A mRNA and protein levels in liver of Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) exposed to hypoxia (dissolved oxygen, DO: 1.7 mg/L for 2 to 4 weeks) compared to fish held in normoxic condition, and suggested that hypoxia-induced down-regulation of CYP1A is due to alterations of nitric oxide and oxidant status, and cellular IL-1beta and HIFalpha levels. In threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) acutely exposed to hypoxia for 4-48 hours, Leveelahti et al. [46] , however, observed increased expression of CYP1A2 mRNA, a finding also confirmed at the protein level by EROD activity measurement. These findings suggest that hypoxia exposure may affect the expression of AhR-mediated P450 genes. The reason for the altered transcription of CYP1A in hypoxia-stressed fish, which we were not able to independently verify with RT-qPCR in the current work, should be studied further.",

Several signal transduction cascades, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and HIF-1, are activated in response to hypoxia in fishes and other vertebrates [48, 49] . AMPK activation in mammals inhibits energetically costly anabolic processes such as protein synthesis, glycogen synthesis, and fatty acid synthesis rates [47] . One AMPK gene, the 5-amp-activated protein kinase subunit beta-1 (PRKAB1), was found included in our dataset from the low oxygen exposure gene list but was not present in the normoxia library gene list. The PRKAB1 subunit of AMPK may be a positive regulator of AMPK activity [38] . Also present in the hypoxia gene list but not present in the normoxia gene list was the hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1A). HIF1A is a transcription factor that functions as a master regulator of gene expression in response to hypoxia [50] . HIF-1 protein is a heterodimer composed of an alpha and a beta subunit that is involved in cellular processes such as energy metabolism, apoptosis, proliferation, death and growth. Both acute and chronic hypoxia can distinctly affect mRNA levels of HIF-1, and this gene has been suggested as a reliable fish biomarker of hypoxia exposure [51] . Heat treatment mediated a reduced expression of HIF1A mRNA in liver of Atlantic salmon. According to the RT-qPCR data HIF1A transcription appeared to be stimulated at moderate heat stress (15\u00b0C), but was significantly lower at more severe heat stress (17-19\u00b0C) . A similar response pattern has been observed in the North Sea eelpout (Zoarces viviparous), with elevated DNA binding activity of HIF-1 during mild heat exposure (18\u00b0C) but impaired activity at more severe heat stress [35] . A possible link between temperature and HIF-1 activity has previously also been shown for crucian carp (Carassius carassius) [52] .",

In zebrafish embryos it has been shown that hypoxia strongly induces transcription of the IGFBP1 [54, 55] . Overexpression of IGFBP1 resulted in reduced growth in zebrafish embryos under normoxic condition, suggesting that the IGFBP1 protein plays an important role on fish growth during hypoxia and may even be an activator of the HIF-1 system. In line with our finding, Rahman and Thomas [53] found that chronic hypoxia exposure (2-4 weeks) caused significant increase in liver IGFBP1 mRNA in Atlantic croaker. IGFBP1 transcription thus appears to be a good biomarker for chronic hypoxia also in Atlantic salmon. Two IGFBP1 genes have been found in Atlantic salmon possibility due to whole genome duplication [56, 57] , and these seem to be differentially regulated at the transcriptional level in liver after chronic low oxygen stress but not after temperature stress. Heat stress, induced by a temperature increase from 13\u00b0C to 17\u00b0C, appears to increase the transcription of both IGFBP1A (this study) and IGFBP1B [30] in Atlantic salmon.

SSH cDNA libraries are prone to false positives, whereas normalized cDNA libraries, by removing highabundant rRNA transcripts, increase sequence coverage depth and transcript diversity across non-rRNA populations [58] . For this reason we have not attempted to compare the libraries quantitatively. By using pooled samples, and two different library construction methods, the RNA-seq data presented here should be considered indicative rather than exact quantitative measures of molecular effects of treatments that mitigate effects at the physiological level, i.e. reduced growth. As expected, fewer large contigs, contigs of at least 500 bp, were obtained by using SSH cDNA libraries than by using normalized cDNA libraries. With SSH technology, about 2000 large contigs were obtained from the heat stress experiment, whereas about 8000 large contigs were obtained from the normalized libraries. More equal numbers were obtained from the four cDNA libraries by selecting contigs consisting of more than 50 reads for the functional analyses. The selected strategy may have created a bias toward higher expressed genes, but represents a trade-off between confounding the pathway analysis by using too many input genes and lost strength by not including enough low-expressed genes.",

Co-orthologs with high sequence similarity may show differential expression but obtain similar best annotation. This phenomenon may explain the apparently contradictory finding for the CYP1A gene. According to the SSH library data, CYP1A was up-regulated by heat stress, while at the same time the RT-qPCR analysis suggested CYP1A to be down-regulated. Differential expression of orthologous HIF1A genes has recently been described in cyprinids, with one of the orthologs being more sensitive to oxygen tension [59] .

While heat stress in general appears to reduce the overall transcriptional rate, increased protein catabolism appears to be one of the main effects of low oxygen saturation stress. Predicted upstream transcriptional regulators suggest that the two types of stress affect many identical mechanisms in liver cells resulting in a metabolic depression.",

Large immature Atlantic salmon (NLA strain) with a body mass of 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 kg were randomly distributed into 12 3 m 2 indoor tanks on August 6, 2009. After acclimation, on October 2, 2009, temperatures were adjusted to 13\u00b0C, 15\u00b0C, 17\u00b0C and 19\u00b0C, with triplicate tanks in 35 g/L seawater for each temperature and oxygen levels at 90% saturation (8 mg and 6 mg O 2 /L at 13 and 19\u00b0C, respectively). Temperatures were maintained at these levels until fish sampling on November 16 after 45 days of exposure. All fish were fed a commercial diet (Optiline, Skretting ARC, Stavanger, Norway). The feed contained 34.9% lipid, 37.9% protein, 5.8% ash, and 6.2% moisture, and had a gross energy content of 21.7 MJ/kg digestible energy (DE). At the end of the experiment, 36 fish, with nine fish from each treatment (three from each of the triplicate tanks with similar treatment) were collected 4 hours postprandial for weight and length measurements and tissue collection. The fish were killed with a blow to the head without sedation. Liver tissue samples for RNA extraction were immediately dissected out and flash frozen on liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80\u00b0C until further analysis.

Immature Atlantic salmon of NLA strain weighing between 1.5-2.0 kg were distributed into 3 m tanks on April 11, 2011. All fish were pit tagged prior to the experiment. Using triplicate tanks for each treatment, Atlantic salmon were divided into 18 tanks and given six different treatments. Half of the fish were fed a high-energy diet (22 MJ DE, 9 tanks), and the other half a low-energy diet where lipids were exchanged with carbohydrate (20.5 MJ DE, 9 tanks). The high-energy diet contained 36.9% lipid, 38.7% protein, 5.0% ash and 5.5% moisture, while the low-energy diet contained 31.6% lipid, 36.4% protein, 5.0% ash and 6.5% moisture. One group of fish was fed a diet containing the same energy level as fish kept at low oxygen, called pair feeding to discriminate feed intake effects. The fish were presented with the following three different treatments; optimum oxygen (7-8 mg O 2 /L), optimum oxygen with pair feeding (7mg O 2 /L), or low oxygen (4-5 mg O /L) all in triplicate tanks (n = 9, N = 54). Low oxygen levels were simulating typical natural farming conditions [60] , with cyclic low dissolved oxygen levels during night and increased normal levels during day with average 6 mg O /L between 12:00-18:00 h. Temperature was kept constant at 12\u00b0C during the trial with stable 35 g/L seawater and the fish were reared under a simulated natural photoperiod.

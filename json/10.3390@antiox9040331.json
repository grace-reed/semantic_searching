                "text": "Faced with growing consumer demand for bio-based or natural products and the need to become less dependent on fossil resources, industry is turning to eco-friendlier products and processes. In this context, lignin and related chemicals (e.g., lignans, phenolic acids) appear as a valuable source of sustainable aromatic building blocks [1, 2] . Indeed, p-hydroxycinnamic acids and their derivatives can be readily extracted from different biomasses and be further (chemo-)enzymatically modified [3] [4] [5] [6] to provide them with physicochemical and biological properties of interest in various fields, such as antioxidants [7] [8] [9] and anti-UV compounds [10] [11] [12] . However, p-hydroxycinnamic acids and their derivatives are not only poorly water soluble, but also they are usually present in relatively small quantities in biomass, thus greatly limiting their uses at the industrial scale. To overcome the latter issue, many synthetic methods have been designed to access p-hydroxycinnamic acids in high yield and at large scale from commercially available reagents. Among them, the main synthetic route consists in the condensation of malonic acid with p-hydroxybenzaldehydes through the Knoevenagel-Doebner reaction.",

For instance, ionic liquids can substitute pyridine and represent an interesting alternative thanks to their recyclability [16] [17] [18] .

Synthetic pathways to p-hydroxycinnamic diacids according to Vivier et al. [31] (1), Mangala et al. [32] (2), Schijndel et al. [33] (3), and our study (4) . Although the reaction conditions of the above procedures are globally in line with the green chemistry principles and HPLC conversions are promising, isolated yields remain relatively low [31] or not described [32, 33] . Additionally, Mangala et al.'s [32] (Figure 1 , pathway 2) method uses titan derivatives (Ti-PCS) as catalyst. Titan derivatives, such as TiO 2 , are widely described as detrimental for the environment or DNA so limiting the use of such as metal catalysts would be relevant [34] [35] [36] . Under these considerations, in this work, we therefore sought to develop a synthetic pathway that provides p-hydroxycinnamic diacids in high yield and at the multigram scale while being environmentally friendly. Moreover, with p-hydroxycinnamic diesters being reported as having high anti-UV and antioxidant properties [10, 11, 37] , a specific focus has also been put on the evaluation of the radical scavenging and UV filtering capacities of the p-hydroxycinnamic diacids.",

It was observed that the mechanism of the p-hydroxycinnamic diacid formation strongly depends on the reaction conditions as depicted in Figure 2 . In their study, the formation of ferulic diacid in 68% yield was observed using the following conditions: 1 equivalent (eq) of vanillin in ethanol (0.5 M), 3 eq of malonic acid, and 1.1 eq of proline, 16 h at 40 \u00b0C ( Figure 3 ) [27] . This result served as foundation for the optimization of the phydroxycinnamic diacid synthesis. The Knoevenagel-Doebner condensation of malonic acid with p-hydroxybenzaldehydes is known to be highly dependent on four parameters: temperature (Temp), reaction time (t), mMalonic acid equivalents (MEq), and proline equivalents (PEq) [27] . In order to determine the impact of these four variables on the conversion to ferulic diacid, a design of experiment (DoE) based on a D-optimal The Knoevenagel-Doebner condensation of malonic acid with p-hydroxybenzaldehydes is known to be highly dependent on four parameters: temperature (Temp), reaction time (t), Malonic acid equivalents (MEq), and proline equivalents (PEq) [27] . In order to determine the impact of these four variables on the conversion to ferulic diacid, a design of experiment (DoE) based on a D-optimal design consisting of 28 experiments, including a triplicate at the central point to evaluate the reproducibility, was performed. Parameters and their variations are reported in Table 1 .",

Moreover, the heating time was reduced four-fold, thus reducing the energetic demand of our synthetic procedure. To determine more precisely the improvement brought by the optimized procedure in terms of atom economy, the process mass intensity (PMI) has been calculated (Table 4 ; details in Table S3 in the ESI) [38] . In this calculation, according to its definition, all of the matter, except water, involved in the reaction-such as reagents, solvents, treatment solution-is considered. The sum of these masses necessary to produce 10 mmol of ferulic diacid is divided by the mass of 10 mmol of ferulic diacid (i.e., 2.382 g). The lower the PMI, the higher the atom economy. As the solvent of the reaction (i.e., EtOH), could be eventually recovered and recycled, the PMI calculation has been carried out considering both the reagents and the solvent (Table 4 , entry 1), and the reagents only (Table 4 , entry 2). For the two conditions, crude diacids were purified with the same procedure (C18-reversed phase silica gel column, H 2 O/MeOH), so these steps were not considered in PMI calculations.

Spectra of the four diacids are reported in Figure 6 and their \u03bbmax were measured and are reported in Table 6 . Diacids exhibit interesting properties as UV filters for both the UVB region (280-315 nm) and the UVA region (315-400 nm). Particularly, caffeic diacid has a very interesting wavelength coverage from 270 to 400 nm, making it the most promising UV filter among the diacids synthesized herein. Moreover, coumaric diacid, whose coverage is narrower than that of caffeic diacid, showed the higher absorbance intensity of the series. As described by Horbury et al. for DES and ES, photostability is an important parameter when describing UV filters [10] . Indeed, an efficient UV filter must not lose its absorbance at \u03bb max upon UV exposure. To assess photostability, one usually performs the UV analysis of a given UV filter in solution after having been exposed to irradiation at 300 nm (P = 8.32 W/m 2 ) for one hour (t 60 ) at T = 35 \u2022 C. This t 60 UV spectrum is then compared to the original one (t 0 ), and the loss in absorbance is calculated at the \u03bb max . Photostability was investigated for the four diacids, DES, and Octinoxate\u2122, a widely used UV filter in sunscreen and employed as an anti-UV-B reference (Table 6 ). Interestingly, diacids showed a low loss in absorbance (<10%, Table 6 ), coumaric and caffeic diacids possessing the best photostability with 3.0% and 4.9% of absorbance loss, respectively. Although DES exhibits a \u03bb max of 335 nm and only lose 3.3% of its absorbance upon exposure to irradiation [10] its use as UV filter may be quite limited because of its low water solubility due to the two hydrophobic ester functions. Such water solubility issue is overcome in the case of diacids whose carboxylic acid moieties warrants great water solubility. As for Octinoxate\u2122, not only is its photostability the worst (26.5% loss in absorbance) but it is considered a hazard for coral reefs and is banned from sale and distribution in some Pacific islands, such as Hawaii, by January 1 st , 2021 [39, 40] . To summarize, these results demonstrate the high potential of the diacids as alternative to Octinoxate\u2122. Figure S3. [c] ESI Figure S4 .",

                "text": "UV filters in sunscreens are doped with antioxidants to prevent and enhance their photo-protection as solar irradiation generates free radicals and damages UV filters leading to a loss of efficiency [41] . Moreover, antioxidants allow skin protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by UV-B [42] . A benefit for new UV filters would be to have both a good photostability and good antioxidant properties. In this way, we investigated the antioxidant capacities of the p-hydroxycinnamic diacids as polyphenols are widely recognized as good antioxidant agents thanks to the ability of phenols to quench free radicals [43] . Antiradical activities were measured through DPPH analysis [44] . These analyses consist in the addition of potential antiradical p-hydroxycinnamic diacid solution in ethanol at different concentrations to homogeneous DPPH solution. The amount needed to reduce the initial number of DPPH free radicals by half (i.e., EC 50 ) was determined by the crossing point of the \"% DPPH\" curve (blue) and the \"% reduced DPPH\" curve (green) (Figure 7) . The lower the EC 50 value, the higher the antioxidant potential. As an example, the antiradical analysis of caffeic diacid is described into Figure 7 .",

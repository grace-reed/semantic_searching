                "text": "Aquatic organisms have evolved unique reproductive organs. Evolutionary processes have resulted in various germinal acinus structures that are associated with a variety of reproductive strategies. In fish, gonadal cells consist of gonadal somatic cells and germ cells from larval to adult stage. The fish germ cells have been clearly characterized with various molecular markers, whereas those of marine invertebrates have been rarely characterized and with few markers. For example, mitotic germ cells (i.e., oogonia and spermatogonia) of Pacific oyster were identified by a vasa-like gene (Fabioux et al., 2004) . In addition, immature germ cells (i.e., spermatogonia and oogonia or primary oocytes) in Stony coral were identified by piwi (Shikina et al., 2015) . These germ cell markers have enabled us to visualize germ cell distribution during embryogenesis and gonad development throughout the reproductive cycle. In contrast to germ cell studies, there has been less focus on gonadal somatic cells, even though somatic cells have a crucial by germ cell migration, proliferation, sex differentiation, and maturation processes. Schulz et al. (2010) reviewed the basic structure of the spermatogenic tubule segment in fish with cystic-type spermatogenesis, unlike in mammals. In fish, each spermatogenic/ovarian cyst is encircled by Sertoli cells or granulosa cells, respectively. These cystic structures were revealed by studies of gonadal somatic cells in fish reviewed in elsewhere (Schulz et al., 2010) . Therefore, gonadal somatic cell markers in marine invertebrates are powerful tools for identifying gonadal somatic cells and visualizing germinal tubule segment structure associated with cystic-type spermatogenesis, which can help us better understand gametogenesis.",

Importantly, gsdf is not found in tetrapods and widely characterized in teleosts, such as the medaka Oryzias latipes (Shibata et al., 2010) and zebrafish Danio rerio (Yan et al., 2017) . In addition, gsdf was identified in the coelacanth Latimeria menadoensis (Forconi et al., 2013) , which indicates that gsdf was acquired from a two rounds of whole-genome duplication event.

The Yesso scallop is a completely gonochoric species with a morphologically separated gonad organ, which allows us to analyze the gonad development, sex differentiation, and sexual maturity. For the annual reproductive cycle, Yesso scallops normally enter the growing phase in winter and spawn in spring once per year in the northern coast of Japan. Osada et al. (2007) determined reproductive status throughout the year and classified the gonad development into seven stages: I, undifferentiating; II, early differentiating; III, growing; IV, mature; V, spawning; VI, post-spawning; and VII, degenerating stages. However, the cell-cell interactions between germ and somatic cells, and the cystic structure are still unclear in this species because germ cells and gonadal somatic cells are not clearly characterized by each molecular marker gene.",

Moreover, for the gonadal somatic cells, \"auxiliary cells\" were previously proposed in the scallop ovary based on electron microscopy (Dorange & Le Pennec, 1989) ; however, the details of cell classification are still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to identify the specific marker gene for firm identification of gonadal somatic cells in the Yesso scallop. Previous studies noted that vitellogenin (Osada et al., 2004) and foxl2 (Nagasawa et al., 2019) are expressed in the gonadal somatic cells in the Yesso scallop, but they are only expressed in female gonads, and potential markers for male somatic cells remained unclear. In this paper, we characterize a novel molecular marker that is specifically expressed in the gonadal somatic cells of the Yesso scallop. The gene designated as bone morphogenetic protein 2a (Bmp2a) is a TGF\u03b2 superfamily member. In addition, we report the spatio-temporal expression pattern of bmp2a as a gonadal somatic cell marker in the Yesso scallop. Observation of bmp2a-positive gonadal somatic cells indicated changes of the germinal acinus structure for both sexes during the reproductive phase.",

Secondly, the IHC for Vasa was performed as above described in Section 2.5 with small modifications. Briefly, after the signal detection of RNAscope ISH, the DAB-stained sections were transferred to the IHC detection step started by boiling in HistoVT One solution (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 30 min for inactivation of the labelled HRP activity and antigen retrieval. The treatment of 1% hydrogen peroxide in methanol solution was skipped. For a dual color staining, the Vina Green chromogen kit (Biocare Medical, CA, USA) was applied for the second chromogenic reaction. The dual colorimmunostained section was counterstained with hematoxylin and bluing, dehydrated, and mounted using Softmount (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Importantly, the optimal concentration of Vasa antibody was set at higher concentration (diluted 1:6000 with TBST) than an ordinally IHC procedure with HRP/DAB system described in Section 2.5 due to a lower sensitivity of chromogenic reaction and a partial digestion of antigen by the permeabilization step during the RNAscope procedure.",

The program was initially set at 50 \u2022 C for 2 min and 95 \u2022 C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u2022 C, 15 s at 56 \u2022 C, and 15 s at 72 \u2022 C.

The cycle threshold values were set at 0.1 to define the level of arbitrary fluorescence intensity using QuantStudio Design & Analysis Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Amplification efficiency (E, %) was calculated from a standard curve constructed from a diluted series of pooled cDNA samples (1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16). Four stable reference genes [40S ribosomal protein S23 (RS23), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1A), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F (EIF3F), and 60S ribosomal protein L16 (RPL16)] were chosen from previous reports (Li et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2013) and validated again with our specimens. Using geNorm software (https://genorm.cmgg.be/), the two best reference genes (RS23 and RPL16) were selected among the four genes (geNorm stability values, M, were 0.320, 0.342, 0.352, and 0.379 for RS23, rpl16, EF1A, and EIF3F, respectively) for all gonad cDNA specimens and applied to calculate normalization factors. The mRNA expression levels were calculated using the relative standard curve method with the normalization factors calculated above.

Among the 11 TGF\u03b2 candidate genes in Table 1 , we numbered genes that overlapped; for example, three Bmp2s were isolated in the output and numbered (i.e., Bmp2a, Bmp2b, and Bmp2c). Multiple sequence alignment detected that all 11 TGF\u03b2 candidate genes have the seven conserved cysteine residues that are typical TGF\u03b2-specific motifs, although Gsdf and og-TGF\u03b2-like lacked one cysteine residue (Fig. 1) . Domain analysis revealed that all 11 TGF\u03b2 candidate genes of the Yesso scallop possessed a TGF\u03b2 domain (Fig. 2) , but no other conserved domain was detected. The phylogenetic tree with TGF\u03b2 superfamily members from various animals indicated that og-TGF\u03b2-like and a couple of Bmp sequences from the Yesso scallop formed one cluster: specifically, Bmp2a and Bmp10a clustered with og-TGF\u03b2like in a clade, whereas other scallop Bmp2s and Bmp10s were grouped in other clades (Fig. 3) .

Members of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily play critical roles in signaling pathways and are involved in cellular processes like cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and cellular homeostasis (Shibata et al., 2010) . Although most TGF\u03b2s show ubiquitous expression patterns (Lelong et al., 2000) , gsdf showed specific expression in teleost gonads (Sawatari et al., 2007; Shibata et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2017) . Similarly, the Pacific oyster og-TGF\u03b2-like showed specific expression in gonads (Fleury et al., 2008) . In this study, we first characterized a TGF\u03b2 member showing gonad-specific expression in the Yesso scallop. A consensus structure of TGF\u03b2 members include the seven conserved cysteine residues, which form a three-dimensional structure and dimer in the carboxy-terminal region of the mature protein (Kingsley, 1994) . Intriguingly, gsdf and og-TGF\u03b2-like, which are known gonadal somatic cell-specific genes, have six conserved cysteines and lack the seventh cysteine residue (Fleury et al., 2008) . Our BLAST survey confirmed that no gsdf ortholog was found in the Yesso scallop transcriptomes, which supports that gsdf was acquired at a two rounds of whole-genome duplication event (Forconi et al., 2013) . In contrast, the BLAST survey with og-TGF\u03b2-like query revealed 11 TGF\u03b2-related sequences in the Yesso scallop. Most TGF\u03b2-related sequences in the Yesso scallop showed the seven conserved cysteine residues except for Bmp7like and Inhibin. Multiple alignment revealed that the scallop Bmp2a and Bmp10a possessed all seven conserved cysteines, which indicates similar three-dimensional structural properties between the scallop Bmps and fish Gsdf homologs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all molluscan TGF\u03b2-related genes were distinct from the teleost gsdf clade, which indicates that there are no gsdf orthologs in molluscs. Although other Bmp2 and Bmp10 isoforms formed different clades, Bmp2a and Bmp10a were positioned in the same clade with og-TGF\u03b2-like. This gonad-specific expression pattern of those bivalve TGF\u03b2s contrasts with the pleiotropic roles commonly ascribed to most TGF\u03b2s in a variety of physiological processes (Ten Dijke et al., 2000) .

In exons, 5 \u2032 -and 3 \u2032 -UTRs (white boxes) and coding region (gray boxes) are indicated. All RT-PCR primers were designed to be intron spanning type in order to eliminate unwanted amplicons caused by genomic DNA contamination as detailed in Table S1 . For bmp2a, two primer sets were designed and applied individually for semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4B) or real-time qPCR (Fig. 7B) analyses. B.

These morphological observations support a close interaction between gonadal somatic and germ cells (Erkan and Sousa, 2002) . This study identified a couple of bmps (i.e., bmp2a and bmp10a) as gonad-specific TGF\u03b2. However, the mRNA localization remained unclear because the general ISH method was not able to detect both bmp mRNA signals. Remarkably, we newly applied RNAscope technology, an extremely sensitive ISH method, and successfully observed the bmp2a mRNA expression for the first time in the gonadal somatic cells, although bmp10a expression has yet to be further analyzed. Our observation found that bmp2a mRNA signals were consistently detected in the gonadal somatic cells but not in the germ cells that expressed Vasa in both testes and ovaries during the reproductive phase. Indeed, the bmp2a-expressing cells were positioned in the interstitial space between the germ cells. These observations clearly indicate that bmp2a can be used as a marker gene of gonadal somatic cells in the Yesso scallop. In testis, the bmp2a-expressing cells were dominated from the growing (January) to mature stages (February), whereas no bmp2a-expressing cells were seen in the area that consists of spermatids and sperm at the mature stage (February). The results demonstrated that bmp2a-positive somatic cells are closely associated with spermatogonia and spermatocytes to support germ cell differentiation in testis. In ovaries, the bmp2aexpressing cells were mainly observed at the oocyte growing phase (December-February). Specifically, the bmp2a mRNA was detected in the somatic cells around the growing oocytes but not in the mature oocytes. The observations for both sexes indicated that the bmp2a-positive cells may correspond to the Sertoli-like cells in testis or follicle-like cells in ovary in the Yesso scallop. It is important to note that the shifts of bmp2a mRNA signals at different maturational stages were identical to the mRNA quantification results by qPCR analysis.",

The bmp2a mRNA level was relatively low at the immature stage (November) in both testis and ovary. The bmp2a mRNA level increased at the mature stage (January) and remained high until after spawning (May) in both gonads. The involvement of TGF\u03b2 in germ cell maintenance has been reported in the rainbow trout Gsdf (Sawatari et al., 2007) and Pacific oyster og-TGF\u03b2-like (Huvet et al., 2012) , which function as activators of germ cell proliferation and are involved differentiation into the meiotic germ cells. Our qPCR results propose that the scallop Bmp2a supports germ cell proliferation and maturation processes for spermatogonia/ spermatocytes or primary/growing oocytes. Functional analysis using gene knockdown or knockout experiments is required to better understand the scallop Bmp2a function in gametogenesis.",

Therefore, we proposed the basic structure of germinal acinus of the Yesso scallop (Fig. 8) . Briefly, somatic and germ cells form a lobule structure. Germ cell differentiation is generally synchronized in the germinal acinus (lobule) in both mitotic and meiotic phases, similar to fish gonads (Schulz et al., 2010) , whereas no obvious cystic structure encircled with somatic cells was identified in the scallop gonads. In the scallop testis, mitotic gem cells (i.e., spermatogonia) proliferate on the basal membrane of the lobule lumen in the growing stage (October). Then, spermatogenesis progresses toward the center of the germinal acinus, similar to mammalian testis structure (Schulz et al., 2010 ). The Fig. 5 . Localization of bmp2a mRNA and Vasa protein in the adult Yesso scallop gonads by using dual RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The testes at undifferentiating stage (October), at early differentiating stage (November), and ovary at mature stage (January) were subjected to the analysis. Sequential sections were prepared for the dual ISH-IHC (left panels, A-C) or HE staining (right panels, D-F). High-magnification images (a-f) were captured from the area outlined by dashed line (A-F). In the dual ISH-IHC, bmp2a mRNA (brown) and my-Vasa protein (green) are detected in somatic cells and germ cells, respectively. Insets indicate that no signal is observed with the RNAscope negative control probe-DapB. The bars represent 50 \u00b5m. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) bmp2a-positive gonadal somatic cells contact spermatogonia and spermatocytes, but they have no such contact with spermatids and sperm at the mature stage (February). Our results showed that bmp2a-positive somatic cells are distributed like mammalian Sertoli cells that contact and support the various germ cell types. In the scallop ovary, oocytes synchronously grow in the germinal acinus during the growing (October) and mature stages (February), whereas the bmp2a-positive somatic cells consistently attach to the growing oocytes until completion of oocyte maturation. These observations demonstrated that the germinal acinus structure of the Yesso scallop is similar to the mammalian testis structure in terms of gonadal somatic cell distribution with possible regulatory functions in germ cell support, as in mammals.",

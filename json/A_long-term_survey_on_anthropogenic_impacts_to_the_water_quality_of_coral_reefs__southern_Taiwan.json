                "text": "The Kenting National Park, including the landmass area and nearshore waters, is located at the southernmost tip of Taiwan (Fig. 1) . The nearshore water region, locally known as the Nanwan Bay, supports one of the highest marine biological diversities within Taiwan. The beautiful landscape of the bay attracts many tourists, which has led to an explosion in tourism. In response to the rapid expansion of tourism, there has been an increase in farmland destruction along the Kenting coast to accommodate architectural constructions such as large hotels. This in turn has led to an increase of domestic wastewaters, some of which will discharge into Nanwan Bay without being treated during periods of heavy rainfall. These untreated inputs along with treated municipal wastes are often dumped directly into nearby creeks which carry excessive nutrient sewage, chemical fertilizers and pesticides into the coastal waters. The Nanwan Bay is also being polluted by excessive suspended sediments during high rainfall events. These sediments could bury coral reefs and benthic organisms, and therefore devastate the local fauna (Bastidas et al., 1999; Riegl et al., 1996; Thomas et al., 2003) . Determining how to monitor the settling rate of suspended particles on coral reefs is therefore a primary goal for biologists (Thomas, 2003; Thomas and Ridd, 2005) . In addition, the coastal area of the Kenting National Park is threatened by the warm effluent water from Nuclear Power Plant, which led to coral bleaching (Huang and Hung, 1987; Hung et al., 1989; Su et al., 1987 Su et al., , 1989 and negative impacts to the marine biological community (Chou et al., 2004) . Furthermore, cold-water intrusion onto the shelf during spring tides (Lee et al., 1997 (Lee et al., ,1999a , typhoons and unknown coral infection, subject the coral reefs within the park to serious risk. High environmental variability along coast places further challenges to survival for the coral reef ecosystem (Hodgson, 1990; Riegl and Branch, 1995; Umar et al., 1998; Rosemond et al., 2002) . Thus, to prevent continual coral reef degradation, determining the complex mechanisms responsible is extremely important.",

The parameters included non-biological factors such as nearshore ocean currents, physical and chemical properties of seawater, and biological factors such as primary productivity, specific compositions and interspecific relationships among phytoplankton and zooplankton, algae, invertebrates, corals and fishes. Historical data collected from past years along the coast of the Nanwan Bay indicate that the nutrients, aerobic organisms and suspended particles come mainly from landmass effluent via channels or creeks. The rainfall data from Taiwan Central Weather Bureau at Kenting National Park area indicates that the wet season is from May to September and the dry season is from October to April, except for occasional heavy rain during dry season. The present study was aimed at collecting data on rainfall, stream fluxes and polluted material concentration from the past four years, but also included preliminary estimates on the fluxes of nutrients and suspended sediments from the main streams using the relationship among three factors. The results indicate that the influences of nutrients, aerobic organisms and suspended sediments contributing to the bay after mixing and dilution are negligible, even during the wet season. Further investigations should be conducted on determining how mixing and dilution of polluted materials prior to entering the Bay influence the potential for negative impacts. The present paper attempts to introduce the water quality for marine environmental monitoring and reports the recent monitoring results with emphasis on the coral reefs monitoring program along the Nanwan Bay.",

Beginning in 1987, the quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) system and high standards of laboratory practices for environmental monitoring were established in our laboratory. The procedures and frequency used for periodic calibration of the equipment in monitoring must be specific. Calibration practice includes initial calibration, routine calibration, and specific calibration. In general, the governmental QA/QC system (Hung, 1987; Yang, 1987) including the sampling techniques, sample handling, laboratory services, glassware and analytical performance (such as control charts), is modified from the systems of USEPA (1979) , principles of environmental analysis (CEI/ACS, 1983) and of QA/QC for analytical laboratory (AOAC, 1984) . For the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) monitoring program, the specific QA/QC for sampling (UNEP, 1991) and high standards of laboratory practices for analytical performance (UNEP, 1990; NOAA, 1988) were also applied. The general QA/QC programs for our marine environmental monitoring are as follows.",

Low values of dissolved oxygen (as low as 3.53 mg/L) were observed, along with high values of biochemical oxygen demand (as high as 7.4 mg/L), in the water along the Bau-Li and Shir-Neou coastal areas. In general, high standard deviation values indicate unstable conditions of the water quality, which could be the result of anthropogenic impacts. On the other hand, a narrow standard deviation signifies more stable condition of water quality. The data indicates that the contents (such as nitrite-N, nitrate-N, phosphate-P and silicate-Si) in water collected along the coast of the Nanwan Bay varied with season and location. For instance, high pollutant values were generally observed at the estuary stations, particularly near river outlets (such as Bau-Li River, Kang-Kou River and Shir-Neou stream) immediately following heavy rain during wet season.

Therefore, the degree of pollution of the three main rivers draining into Kenting coastal area were thoroughly assessed by monitoring dissolved oxygen, BOD 5 , suspended solids and ammonia-N. The degree of stream pollution defined in this study was followed River Pollution Index (RPI) (Liou et al., 2003) . The results indicated that the percentage of rivers maintained in good condition in the Kenting National Park were 44.4% in 2003. However, about 38.8% were moderately polluted in 2003. In general, the degrees of pollution in the three main rivers discharging in the Nanwan Bay were between low pollution to moderate pollution (Fig. 3) . Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment can stimulate algal blooms (Gobler et al., 2002) . In February 2002, we found the first incidence of green tide caused by nutrient pollution along the Shir-Neou coastal area. The chlorophyll-a content of phytoplankton in water was extremely high (e.g., 339 mg/L, 15.3 mg/L and 3.84 mg/L in February 2002 , May 2002 and June 2002 . Therefore, the correlation between nutrients and the content of chlorophyll-a was further investigated. Extremely higher nutrients (such as nitrite, nitrate and phosphate), BOD , turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration in the water were observed in the Shir-Neou coastal area compared to those in other coastal areas. Experimental data also indicated that accumulation of nutrients varied with different seasons. For instance, the higher nutrient content would be accumulated in the river water be-tween dry seasons, and the lower nutrient content would be diluted in river water between monsoonal seasons.",

River discharge, fluxes of nutrients and suspended solids were all dependent on rainfall. Traditionally, the Flow interval method (Ryding and Rast, 1989 ) is used to calculate the fluxes of nutrients. Fig. 4a shows the relationship between the discharges of the Kang-Kou stream and the rainfall. A relatively consistent correlation was found between nutrient abundance in the water and rainfall, except at the high rainfall condition (Fig. 4b ). The drop of nutrient level at high rainfall was attributed to dilution effect. In the other words, rainfall will flush the nutrients concentrated on the stream floor into the bay, which increase in the concentration of nutrient detected. However, when the rainfall increases up to a level, the dilution effect will overturn the increase of nutrient level in waters. Therefore, we used the formulas determined from the relationship between nutrients, discharges and rainfall to calculate the annual fluxes of nutrients and suspended solid from river water to seawater along the Nanwan Bay (Fig. 5) . Generally, only rainfall data from Taiwan Central Weather Bureau, readily accessible over the internet, is needed to obtain the flux data of nutrients. It is a rapid, economical and convenient method to calculate the flux of nutrients from river water to seawater. Nutrient chemistry and budgets in marine ecosystems and coral reef communities have been widely studied (Redfield et al., 1963; Chen et al., 2001; Hedges et al., 2002; Holmes et al., 2001; Johannes et al., 1983; Lapointe, 1997; Miller et al., 1999; Morell et al., 2001; Tockner et al., 2002 impression is that nutrient fluxes in the Nanwan Bay are mainly influenced by river pollution. High concentrations of nutrients from river waters at the Kenting National Park and consequent nutrient enrichment have been inferred primarily from field observations. On the other hand, there is daily periodical upwelling during spring tides within the Nanwan Bay, which is a result of cyclonic eddy pumping caused by the combined effects of tidal flow and topography (Lee et al., 1999a,b) . Consequently, another source of nutrients derived from the upwelling into the Nanwan Bay was recognized (Chen et al., 2004) . In terms of estimating the increase of nutrient concentrations by river discharge in the Nanwan Bay, we obtained the net nutrient fluxes of the Shir-Neou Stream divided by the overall volume and area of the Nanwan Bay. The overall volume and area of the Nanwan Bay are approximately 2.07 \u00c2 10 9 m 3 and 4.73 \u00c2 10 7 m 2 , respectively, which were calculated from a high-resolution numerical model of 200 m by 200 m in horizontal resolution and 7.5 m in vertical resolution (model not shown). The average fluxes of NO eN, NO 2 e N, PO 4 eP derived from Shir-Neou Stream discharge into the Nan-wan Bay are approximately 2.11 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 , 1.58 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 , 2.66 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 kg/m 2 /year during 2001e2004, respectively, which are calculated by the formulas from the relationships between nutrients, discharges and rainfall. In the other words, in the Nan-wan Bay, the average daily increase in concentrations of NO 3 eN, NO 2 eN, PO 4 eP that were contributed by the Shir-Neou Stream discharge are 1.32 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 , 9.84 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 , 1.66 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 mg/L/day, respectively. Yet, the results also indicated that the average daily increase in concentrations of nutrients derived from upwelling loading (0.52 kg N/m 2 /yr or 3.23 \u00c2 10 1 mg/L/day; personal communication with HJ Lee) were three orders of magnitude higher (2.45 \u00c2 10 3 factor) than the anthropogenic-derived loading (2.11 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 kg/m 2 /year). The foregoing estimates presume that all river inputs distribute evenly in the entire Bay. In reality, river inputs are preferably retained in shallow reaches of the Bay where effects of pollution are expected to be much higher.",

There was significant correlation between salinity and nutrient concentrations in the water. This implies that the sources of nutrients were from streams around Nanwan Bay. Obviously, there was significant correlation between dissolved oxygen and pH in the water. This indicates that the effects of photosynthesis and respiration on pH by organism (such as phytoplankton and algae) in the water. A relatively consistent correlation was found between nutrient and ammonia concentrations in the water and BOD 5 . On the other hand, there was also significant correlation between nutrient and ammonia concentrations in the water and chlorophyll-a contents. As we mentioned before, an increase of domestic wastewaters which carry excessive nutrients will flow into Nanwan Bay without being treated leading to increases in chlorophyll-a content and BOD 5 . Effects of water quality (such as sediments, thermal stress and nutrients) on coral reef ecosystem have been widely studied (Crossland et al., 1984; Woolfe and Larcombe, 1999; Miller and Cruise, 1995; Gilmour, 1999; Nugues and Roberts, 2003; James et al., 2005; Bruno et al., 2007; Manzello et al., 2007; Liao et al., 2007) .

Over the past 4 years beginning from 2001, a number of studies have estimated sediment and nutrient loads by integrating flow and nutrient concentrations obtained from the mouths of the three streams that carry terrestrial materials discharging into the Nanwan Bay. This paper is the first time to describe the interactions between water quality and corals near estuaries along the Nanwan Bay. These terrestrial materials by way of riverine plumes in their estuaries will be carried by tidal currents and winds, moving back and forth along Nanwan coast. These higher nutrient and sediments from stream plumes during heavy rainfall, especially occurring in the wet season, are mostly confined in shallow water zone. In light of sampled data, the results show that the higher nutrients, BOD 5 and suspended solids concentrations alongshore were found in Bau-Li, Kang-Kou and Shir-Neou estuarine waters compared with those to other coastal water.",

In summary, the water quality of shallow water in the Nanwan Bay has been degraded, and actually has impacted on some corals (Tkachenko et al., 2007) . To our knowledge, some corals such as Acropora sp. and Pocillopra damicornis are dominant species in shallow water throughout the coast of the Nanwan Bay, because they prefer to live within 5 m of water depth (Vaz, 2000) . The episodic heavy rainfall in wet season increase flow flux and turbidity flux from streams to shallow reaches of the Bay. In terms of estimating the overall increase of nutrient concentrations by river discharge during heavy rainfall runoff from the three streams, including Bau-Li, Kang-Kou and Shir-Neou streams around the Nanwan peninsula, the results indicate that anthropogenic nutrient loads have negatively influenced on the survival of the shallow water corals from a long-term point of view due to degrading water quality of these estuaries. Actually, higher nutrients and suspended sediments have made the algae with abnormal growth in coral reefs (Tkachenko et al., 2007) , leading to the parts of shallow water corals being covered by algae and buried by sediments. Although sampled data also illustrate that concentrations of these terrestrial materials collected from stream catchments were diluted rapidly in offshore regions, higher nutrient concentrations still make the impacts in shallow water corals.

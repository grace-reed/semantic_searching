They are known to have antiviral functions in aquatic crustacean species, but little is known about the role of miRNAs against environmental stress caused by Cu, a common chemical contaminant in aquatic environment. We performed small RNA sequencing to characterize the differentially expressed microRNAs in Cu exposed shrimp.

Among them, 218 miRNAs were conserved across 115 species. The validation of 12 miRNAs by stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR were found to be coherent with the expression profile of deep sequencing data as evaluated with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r = 0.707). Target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs related to immune defense, apoptosis, and xenobiotics metabolism also showed significant changes in expression under Cu stress. The present study provides the first characterization of L. vannamei miRNAs and some target genes expression in response to Cu stress, and the findings support the hypothesis that certain miRNAs along with their target genes might be essential in the intricate adaptive response regulation networks. Our current study will provide valuable information to take an insight into molecular mechanism of L. vannamei against environmental stress.",

With the development of industrialization and intensive aquaculture, aquatic pollution has become a severe and growing problem. Among various environmental pollutants, heavy metals have been of great concern because of their inherent toxicity, non-degradability and persistence [1] . In aquaculture practices, copper sulfate is commonly used to eradicate filamentous algae and phytoplankton in shrimp farms. The excess application of copper sulfate in pond management may deteriorate the aquatic environment due to Cu accumulation in the pond sediments [2, 3] .",

Those sequences were discarded assuming that they represent degradation and other undesired products. As there was no genome data available for L.vannamei, the remaining sequences were searched against the miRNAs from all the animals in miRBase 21.0 (http://www.mirbase. org/) using BLAST to identify known miRNAs. The steps are as following: (1) considering the difference among species, align clean data to the miRNA precursor/mature miRNA of all animals in miRBase allowing two mismatches and free gaps; (2) choose the highest expression miRNA for each mature miRNA family which is regarded as a temporary miRNA database; (3) align clean data to the above temporary miRNA database and the expression of miRNA is generated by summing the count of reads which can align to the temporary miRNA database within two mismatches; (4) predict the precursor of the identified miRNA, and those that cannot fold stem-loop hairpin structure will be regarded as pseudo-miRNA. The feasibility of the result can be greatly improved by this verification. The novel miRNA candidates were predicted using miRdeep software [27] with L. vannamei transcriptome deep sequencing data [28] based on hairpin-like secondary structure pattern.",

After removal of low quality reads, adapter sequences, poly A sequences, and sequences smaller than 18 nt, a total of 25,686,384 (89.76% of the raw reads) and 21,304,558 (87.77% of the raw reads) cleans reads, containing 845,582 (0 h) and 1,467,075 (3 h) unique sequences, respectively, were generated from the two samples. All the clean reads were annotated using GenBank, Rfam, miRbase 21.0 and our L. vannamei transcriptome databases, and classified into six categories including, rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, miRNA and those without any annotation. The count and proportion of the different categories of small RNAs were showed in Table 2 . Among the different types of small RNA, only a small proportion of small RNAs were annotated (11.54% and 9.81% for 0 h and 3 h, respectively). The length analysis of the small RNAs showed that the two libraries shared a similar size distribution, which both varied from 20 to 23 nt and exhibited a unimodal distribution pattern, with 22 nt being the most abundant class, followed by the 21-, 20-, and 23-nt classes (Fig. 1) .",

In this study, many miRNAs have more than Table S3 ). The predicted target genes, which were stress response-related, of the identified L. vannamei miRNAs were categorized into 9 groups, such as ProPO system, oxidative stress, detoxification, proteinase/proteinase inhibitors, pattern recognition proteins, heat shock proteins, apoptotic related proteins, antimicrobial peptides and other immune molecules (Supplementary File Table S4 ). The predicted interactions of some miRNAs and target immune genes in Cu-exposed shimp are shown in Fig. 4 . To explore the potential pathways regulated by these miRNAs, the target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were subjected to GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis. According to GO classifications, 21348 and 12579 target genes, which were predicted for differentially expressed known and novel miRNAs, were clustered into 56 and 52 GO terms, respectively. The top ten terms according to Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC) and Molecular Function (MF) classifications are illustrated in Fig. 5 . Similar to GO analysis, KEGG pathway analysis was also based on target genes of known and novel miRNAs with differential expression. The results showed that 21348 target genes of known miRNAs were grouped into 307 pathways while 12579 target genes of novel miRNAs were grouped into 308 pathways. As we mapped the top of enriched pathways in descending order of the rich-factor, we found the amoebiasis pathway (ko05146) and vibrio cholerae infection pathway (ko05110) seemed to be some important pathways under Cu stress ( Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 ).",

It has been suggested that miRNAs serve as key players in a robust adaptive response against stress in animals through their capacity to fine-tune gene expression [38] . The role of miRNAs in environmental stress response has been studied in corals [39] , Caenorhabditis elegans [38] , Littorina littorea [40] , Apostichopus japonicus [41] and other mammals. However, no comprehensive miRNA study has been performed on white shrimp under environmental stress. In this investigation, we revealed the repertoire of miRNAs in L. vannamei under Cu stress through RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.

All of the 5 miRNAs of M. japonicus in the miRBase database (http://www. mirbase.org/cgi-bin/mirna_summary.pl?org=mja) were matched with the miRNAs of L. vannamei identified in the present study. The result is in good agreement with the previous study that the 5 miRNAs were all identified in Fenneropenaeus chinensis [42] . Homologs of known miRNAs reported in the shrimp M. japonicus [43] , P. monodon [25] , M. rosenbergii [45] and L. vannamei [23] , such as miR-750, miR-2001, miR-2765, miR-2001, miR-1, miR-7, miR-34, miR-133, miR-317 and miR-965, have also been identified in the present study, implying that these miRNAs might be highly conserved in shrimp. Some miRNAs such as miR-9 [25] , miR-21 [46] , miR-124 [47] , miR-142 [48] , miR-138 [49] which have already been described in vertebrates were found in the present study, suggesting these miRNAs may be conserved from vertebrates to invertebrates. The emergence of novel miRNA sequences may provide opportunities for combinatorial miRNA regulation that contribute to a greater potential for genetic robustness and morphological or functional complexity [39, 50] . In the current study, a total of 62 and 121 novel miRNA candidates were predicted, respectively after exposure for 0 h and 3 h to Cu stress. The results further confirmed that the de novo transcriptome has aided in the prediction of novel miRNA in crustacean [45] and reducing the possibility of over prediction [51] .",

Some miRNAs belong to the family of miR-1175 and miR-750 were the most significantly up-regulated in the present study. This result was consistent with the previous study in L. vannamei after WSSV infection, suggesting these miRNAs were mainly related to cell function and signal transduction [52] . 3 novel miRNAs and 9 known miRNAs identified in our study were validated by stem-loop qRT-PCR, demonstrating a high level of confidence for the obtained data. The relationship analysis between deep sequencing and qRT-PCR revealed the qPCR results of 12 miRNAs agreed with the deep sequencing results (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.707). The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was close to that of the previous studies [45] .

In the present study, the highestexpressed miRNAs were miR-1175-3p and novel-miR-46; and the lowest-expressed miRNAs were miR-228 and novel-miR-8. The prophenoloxidase (proPO) was a predicted target gene of miR-1175-3p. proPO has been extensively investigated in crustaceans due to its crucial role in non-self recognition as well as several subsequent immunodefense processes that are particularly essential to resist microbial infections [53, 54] . Spz3, a predicted target gene of novel-miR-46, is a signaling ligand in innate immune response [55] . Relish is a predicted target gene of miR-228 and has been reported to be involved in immune-deficiency (IMD) signal pathway [56] . Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor, a predicted target gene of novel-miR-8, is an important group of serine protease inhibitors (SPIs) that can modulate several immune processes [57] . In addition to the highest-and lowest-expressed miRNAs, predicted target genes of some other significantly (P < .05) differentially expressed miRNAs were reported to participate in shrimp immunity, oxidative stress, detoxification and apoptosis (Fig. 4) . Some genes were predicted to be regulated by multiple miRNAs, and likewise, a single miRNA might target more than one genes. The results were consistent with the research of P. monodon challenged with WSSV infection, in which the immune-related target genes, apoptosis-related proteins, oxidative stress proteins and other immune molecules were also predicted [25] . Validation of several immune-related, apoptosis-related, or detoxification related target genes of some miRNAs showed that the expression levels of these genes were significantly changed by Cu exposure implying that these target genes might be involved in the shrimp defense mechanisms against environmental stress. However, further investigation is required to explore the potential function and molecular mechanism for these miRNAs and their target genes.",

According to GO analysis, the three most highly enriched GO terms in the BP, CC and MF categories were cellular process, cell and binding, respectively, which is consistent with the previous studies in liver and gill of Larimichthys crocea [58] and in hemocytes of Crassostrea gigas [59] . Some GO terms associated with immune and stress response, (such as MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor, regulation of adaptive immune response and response to stimulus), and repair (such as DNA repair, Oxidative demethylation and negative regulation of DNA repair) are also enriched in the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs. These results were similar with the previous research in in Acropora digitifera under thermal stress [39] . Intriguingly, amoebiasis (ko05146) and vibrio cholerae infection (ko05110) were the most enriched pathways in target genes of both known and novel miRNAs according to the KEGG analysis. In these two enriched pathways, the most enriched target gene was the MUC2/Mucin, an important component of innate defense in a number of enteric infections, including many parasitic infections [60] . It has been reported that during pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), MUC2 biosynthesis and secretion were accelerated [61] , and was considered as a first step towards characterizing the innate immune response in different species [62] . The two significantly enriched pathways might indicate a potential defensive strategy of shrimp against Cu stress, since as a species living in water, shrimp may always face challenges of bacterial infection, especially under Cu stress, which could depress the immune ability and increase the susceptibility to bacteria infection [7] . Some immune related pathways such as JAK-STAT signaling pathway (ko04630), PPAR signaling pathway (ko03320), NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (ko04621), NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (ko04064) and etc, drug and xenobiotics metabolism related pathways such as metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 (ko00982) and drug metabolism-other enzymes (ko00983), and some apoptosis related pathways such as p53 signaling pathway (ko04115) and apoptosis pathway (ko04210) were also significantly enriched. These results indicated that the corresponding miRNAs are involved in various processes of shrimp defense against Cu exposure. The predicted targets and their functional roles in stress response reported here indicate areas of interest that should be further investigated using independent methods.",

The results showed that 218 conserved miRNAs were identified, and the expression levels of 4524 known miRNAs and 73 novel miRNAs were significantly (p < .05) changed by Cu exposure. The deep sequencing results were further verified by a real-time RT-PCR assay. There was a consistency between the deep sequencing and real-time RT-PCR method. Function annotation of the predicted target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs revealed a broad range of pathways and processes related to immune defense, apoptosis, or xenobiotics metabolism were significantly enriched after Cu exposure. These findings will provide valuable information for further investigation on the mechanism of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in the adaptive response of L. vannamei against environmental stress.",

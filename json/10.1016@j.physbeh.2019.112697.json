In fish, as in mammals, coping with aversive and stressful stimulus results from individual differences in risk-taking behaviours. Following the widely adopted rationalization and downsizing of copying style concepts by Koolhaas 1, 2 , fish may behave mainly proactively (actively, adrenaline fuelled) or reactively (passively, cortisol dominated). At one end of the behavioural continuum, proactive personalities in fish seems to predispose to higher rates of aggression, dominance, immune responsiveness, feeding efficiency, metabolism, growth and reproductive success than that of reactive counterparts [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . To what extent these behavioural characteristics affect the competitive ability and phenotypic plasticity of stressed fish is still debatable [9] [10] [11] , the consensus being that personality traits transect the metabolic, immune, reproductive and growth-related responses in a species-specific and context-dependent fashion 12 .",

                "text": "Besides the modal zebrafish (Danio rerio) and other laboratory-friendly species, the effects of binomial and continuous personalities have been analysed in farmed species of high economic value (see Castanheira et al. 10 for a thoroughly review), including, but not limited to, tilapia 13 (Oreochromis mosambicus), salmonids 14 (Salmo salar), rainbow trout 15 (Oncorhynchus mykiss), carp 16 (Cyprinus carpio), European sea bass 17 (Dicentrarchus labrax) and gilthead sea bream 18 (Sparus aurata). This approach usually includes (1) appraising the physiological processes underlying binomial (proactive vs reactive) responses to common stressors, such as anoxia, high densities, and pathogenic challenges, and (2) fitting the fitness of a particular genotype-phenotype ecological paradigm for each species. A common issue for these studies is the evaluation of metabolic scope in proactive fish that guarantees increases in growth, muscular mass and overall activity and exploration, which would weigh the energetic budget that supports the fitness of the observed behavioural phenotype [19] [20] [21] . In this sense, each behavioural choice relies indirectly to an energy balance, which, in turn, defines the muscular activity that enables the selection of desirable performance traits (such as exploration, foraging activity, mating, swimming performance, and dispersal tendencies) in a particular environment. In fish, muscle sums up to 60% of total body mass, constitutes a mechanical adaptation to locomotion in dense mediums, acts as metabolic repository, influences body weight and growth rates, and recently it has been suggested that it might behave as an immune organ during defensive responses to pathogens 22, 23 . Fish myogenesis proceeds by (1) hyperplasia, mainly during larval stages, and hypertrophy across the whole lifespan, especially in species with indeterminate growth 24 , and (2) by the interplay between well conserved vertebrate molecular enhancers and retainers of muscle development. Myoblasts proliferate and differentiate to myocytes with the help of several myogenic regulatory factors and the hormonal axis (reviewed in [24] [25] [26] [27] ) with concerted opposite functions. Myogenin, for example, stimulates the terminal differentiation of myoblasts, whereas myostatin arrests muscle development and growth, thus making genetic editing of somatic growth in farmed fish feasible. It\"s worth noting that, in teleosts, two or more paralogs of each regulatory component of muscular development may be present, due to the several rounds of genome duplication that fish have undergone 28, 29 .",

EA measures the widespread hydrolysis of esters 40 and in fish it has been involved in immune-related antioxidant responses to xenobiotics 38, 41 . Our results suggest that reactive fish seem to be more prone to initiate a delayed low-level antioxidant response in muscle, fuelled by glucose outbursts, following vaccination with The growth hormone (GH) is a coordinator of endogenous and exogenous promoters of fish somatic growth, indirectly through induced IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) production, and directly by binding to specific receptors (GHRs) in myocytes (reviewed in 26 ). The efficacy of the direct effects of GH on muscle development and growth in fish is species-specific 26 , and in gilthead sea bream it seems to be stronger than in mammals 42 . Additionally, teleosts tend to express more than one mediator of common physiological responses due to several rounds of genome duplication . S. aurata genome harbours two actively transcribed genes for GHR grouped in two clades, GHR1 and GHR2, expressed differentially in a seasonal-, context-and tissue-specific manner, especially in fasted fish 44 . It has been suggested that GHR1 regulates the tissue-specific synthesis and secretion of IGFs whereas the anabolic effects mediated by GHR2 seem to be related to energy mobilization and be affected by oxidative imbalances, thus rendering GHR2 more stress-sensitive than GHR1 [44] [45] [46] . However, this adscription greatly differs between fish species and a precise definition of the effects of teleost GHRs activation remains elusive. Our results indicate that the differential physiology, characteristic of divergent behavioural phenotypes, should be summed up when considering the effects of immune insults in the muscle of S. aurata fingerlings.",

This suggests a short-/mediumterm stress-related response, non-oxidative, judging by the measured levels of TAC and EA. Alternatively, the overexpression of ghr2 transcripts in proactive fish may indicate a suppression of inflammation, as suggested in mammalian GHRs , or an increased effect on muscle development concurrent with the significant dual regulation exerted by myogenin and mstn-1 overexpressed transcripts (see below). If, as suggested, GHR2 is involved in mobilization of stored energy, the differential overexpression of ghr2 transcripts in proactive fish may help to supply resources for the extensive post larval muscle hyperplasia characteristic of such an indeterminate grower species 24, 34 in postinfective arenas. The immediate metabolic trade-off imposed by exposure to V.anguillarum serotypes may also induce an over-compensatory response in proactive, but not in reactive fish, more prone to increased muscle development, functionality and locomotion modalities than reactive fish in stress scenarios 30, 31 . In this sense, we may expect an increase in myogenin and mstn-1 transcript expression as observed in proactive fish ( Figure 1B) . 49 . In sea bream, two copies of the mstn-1 gene have been described: mstn-1 and mstn-2, the former widely expressed in several juvenile and adult tissues, including muscle 50 , whereas mstn-2 is found mainly in the nervous system at late larval stages 51 .",

Here we chose an indeterminate grower teleost, Sparus aurata, one of the most important farmed fish in the Mediterranean region, to evaluate the effect of vaccination against Vibrio anguillarum in skeletal muscle of proactive and reactive behavioural fish phenotypes. Seasonal bacterial vibriosis caused by Gram-negative Vibrio species affects several species of estuarine and coastal aquatic animals worldwide 35 . V. anguillarum outbreaks lead to colonization of skin epithelia and gastrointestinal linings and induce ulcerative lesions, tissue necrosis and internal haemorrhages, slowing the growth rate, affecting the muscular metabolism and swimming performance, leading eventually to high (up to 80%) mortalities in cultured fish if untreated 36 . Whether skeletal muscle can play a role in immune regulation of such bacterial pathogens, as recently suggested 22,23 , or be arrested in development due to inflammatory processes remains to be investigated in distinct behavioural phenotypes. This study aims to contribute to such debate by evaluating the effect of V. anguillarum bath vaccination (a preferred vaccination method for small fish) on the expression of skeletal muscle gene transcripts and biochemical parameters in proactive and reactive fingerlings of S. aurata. We analysed transcripts related to muscle metabolism and growth (lipoprotein, lpl; myostatin, mstn-1; myogenin; and growth hormone receptors type II, ghr1 and ghr2, respectively) and inflammation (interleukin 1\u03b2, il1\u03b2; tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, tnf\u03b1; and immunoglobulin M, igm).

Each fish was submitted to three individual coping style screening tests during the same day, in the following order: net restraining test, open field test and new object test. All tests were executed in a dedicated room separate from the housing tank and experimental tanks were covered with white paper in order to reduce stress. Variables of each test were evaluated between 08:00 h and 14:00 h and the water in the tanks was changed between each fish. The net restraining test was used to evaluate the behavioural responses of fish to a stressful situation, discriminating between behavioural phenotypes. The test consisted in holding each fish suspended on a net (16 cm long x 12 cm wide) out of the water for a period of one minute. Three individual behavioural variables were analysed throughout the entire duration of the test: the latency (in seconds) before the first escape, the number of attempted escapes and the time (in seconds) between the first and last escape attempts. An escape attempt was defined as an elevation of the fish\" body from the net. The open field test was performed in a 33 L (48 cm long x 24 cm wide x 29 cm deep) tank with three sides covered with white paper, leaving the fourth side for observation. In one of the tank\"s ends, a black plastic separator was placed, delimitating a refuge area occupying one third of the tank\"s length, while the remaining space inside the tank was considered as a new environment. A horizontal line dividing the tank in two identically sized halves was marked, on the observer\"s side. Individually, fish were placed in the refuge area and left there for 10 minutes, for a short acclimation. After this period of time, the division was cautiously removed and the observation period started. Three behaviours were noted throughout the entire period of 10 min of observation: latency of time to reach the upper half of the tank, time spent in the upper half of the tank and freezing time (all in seconds). Entrance into the tank\"s upper half was considered when the animal\"s cephalic region entered the region. Freezing was specified as absence of movement for at least one second or more, without considering eyes and gills. Finally, the novel object test was performed in the same tank, immediately after the open field test. At one end of the tank, a colourful (blue, green, red and yellow) Lego \u00ae column (8.4 cm x 3 cm x 22.6 cm) was placed, in functions of the novel object. On the bare side of the tank, two vertical lines were drawn, at 10 and 5 cm from the novel object, respectively. The observation period started instantly after the novel object was placed, with a duration of 10 min. The following three behavioural variables were recorded: latency to enter the 10 and the 5 cm area and freezing time. Individuals were registered to have entered an area once the fish\"s cephalic region entered the said area. Animal vaccination and sampling Fish were vaccinated by bath immersion during 1 min with ICTHIOVAC\u00ae VR, an inactivated vaccine against Vibriosis containing the formalin-killed V. anguillarum serotypes O1, O2\u03b1 and O2\u03b2, following the manufacturer's instructions (Hipra, Spain). A control group for time 0h was also mock vaccinated. Control groups are proactive and reactive groups not vaccinated. After this procedure, animals were separated into 8 experimental groups (n=10), 4 for reactive fish and 4 for proactive fish, each placed in a separate 300 L tank. Sampling was done at 0, 3 and 7 days post-vaccination. All fish were euthanized by over-anesthetizing them in a tricaine methanesulfonate (MS222) bath (1g/L). Muscle packages were sampled from the central lateral line region, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.",

However, the unresponsiveness of TAC levels, a proxy for altered general oxidative status, and of CK and AST, clinical markers of muscle damage, indicates that the antioxidant response in both phenotypes, if present, did not influence the overall oxidative metabolism in vaccinated fingerlings. Moreover, the expression levels of immunoglobulin M transcripts, an immunomodulator, and of the canonical pro-inflammatory indicators (interleukin 1\u03b2, il1\u03b2; tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, tnf\u03b1) also remained unaltered one week post-vaccination. This indicates that we can rule out that a strong inflammatory response be responsible for the increased activity of EA in reactive fish. Our results suggest the onset of medium-term mildly oxidative stress in muscle of vaccinated reactive sea breams that should be taken into account for the onset of systemic late immune responses that may emerge from pathogen infection in natural environments.Lipoprotein lipase (lpl) transcripts, a proxy for lipid metabolism in muscle, did not show significant differences among phenotypes or treatments. However, the expression analysis of other actors in muscle metabolism and growth, myogenin, mstn-1 and ghr2 but not ghr1 transcripts, revealed marked differences between proactive and reactive phenotypes (Figure 1B). Ghr2 transcript expression was significantly downregulated in reactive fish when compared to proactive fish, at 1, 3 and 7dpv. Moreover, ghr2 mRNA of proactive fish at 1dpv were significantly increased when compared to their control group. Regarding genes related to muscle development and growth, the mRNA abundance of both myogenin and mstn-1 increased in the proactive group at 1 and 3 dpv, when compared to control group. Myogenin transcripts presented upregulated expression in reactive fish at 1 dpv, when compared to their control group. Finally, mRNA levels of mstn-1 appeared significantly upregulated in proactive fish at 3 dpv, when compared to reactive fish.",

The lethality of V. anguillarum depends on the serotype, host characteristics and the opportunistic pathogens being towed by the inflammation of external and internal epithelial linings, but a lethal outcome at one week post-infection is not rare. Therefore, a strong effect on muscle regulators at 3dpv may affect the metabolic response of fingerlings to infection, and be lethal if the spreading of the pathogen remained unstopped. Moreover, myostatin may influence the outcome of immune responses to pathogens, as suggested by a recent study of Edwardsiella tarda infection in CRISPR/Cas9 edited mstna\u2212/-and mstnb\u2212/homozygous zebrafish 22 , in which deletion of mstn genes impaired immune responses to infection. In another study, spotted groupers (Epinephelus coioides) challenged with nervous necrosis virus induced myostatin promoter activity 53 . Although bath vaccination with V. anguilarum may stimulate the expression of immune mediators in stressed sea bream 8,54 , we did not observe an effect of mstn-1 upregulation in pro-inflammatory cytokines in proactive or reactive S. aurata fingerlings. This can be due to host species-and pathogen-specific characteristics, the slow progressing of immune responses in muscle, and the aforementioned suggested immuno-suppressive effects of GHRs. These and other results underline the importance of myostatin in the crosstalk between muscle metabolism, growth and immune responses in fish. To sum up, our data provide insight into the differential responsiveness of binomial behavioural phenotypes to short-to medium-term pathogen-mediated immunological scenarios in muscle metabolism, development and growth in S. aurata. No effect of immune pro-inflammatory markers seems to be apparent one week post-vaccination with V. anguillarum in gilthead sea bream fingerlings, but the intriguing role of myostatin in immune function described recently deserves more detailed consideration with an emphasis on behavioural phenotyping. In dense and pathogen-loaded aquatic mediums, proactivity clearly defines adaptability in terms of differential responses to regulators of muscle development and growth, and, consequently, also in terms of different swimming behaviour and foraging/exploring capacities. This ultimately leadsto differences in fitness between phenotypically divergent individuals expressing facets of a behavioural continuum that dictates the species-specific adaptive responses to contextualized environmental insults. This should be taken into account when determining a feasible vaccination schedule, but also to elaborate a more comprehensible protocol for assisting fish feeding and growth based in behavioural differences at early stages of development in indeterminate growers. Moreover, it has been suggested that, in a progressive global warming scenario, low-performance (reactive) phenotypes of coral fish (Plectropomus leopardus) may thrive due to the detrimental metabolic effect of high temperatures in sustained proactive (more vigorous) swimmers55 , which adds to the need of a more precise description of speciesspecific interactions of key mediators of muscle development and regulation.",

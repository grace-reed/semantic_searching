This study represents a first step towards characterizing the Douglas-fir transcriptome based on 454 sequencing of twelve cDNA libraries.

Franco) is an ecologically highly variable species that occurs in two main varieties in North America. The natural range of the coastal or green Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) extends over 2,200 km from the Pacific Northwestern fog belt and the adjacent summer-dry Coastal Range and Cascade mountains to the drier coastland of Southern California. The interior or blue Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) is distributed over more than 4,500 km along the dry continental climates of the montane to the subalpine Rocky Mountains from Alberta to Colorado with isolated populations reaching into Mexico. Douglas-fir grows from sea level on Vancouver Island up to 3,000 m altitude in the southern Rocky Mountains [1] . Within its natural range, Douglas-fir has evolved into a variety of genetically diverse populations adapted to contrasting ecozones (e.g. [2, 3] ).",

Like most conifer species, it is able to cope with limitations in soil water availability within its natural range [9, 10] . There is a negative relationship between shoot water potential and the photosynthesis rate [6] , which decreased by about 70% in water-stressed trees with a predawn shoot water potential of about -1.7 MPa. In conifers such as Douglas-fir or pine, the recovery of photosynthesis upon rainfall and rewatering occurs within days together with the rapid recovery of predawn shoot water potential from stressed (around -1.5 MPa), or mildly stressed (around -1.0 MPa) to values higher than -0.5 MPa [6, 11] . This high ecological, genetical and physiological diversity provides an excellent system to study the adaptation of conifer trees to contrasting environments.",

To achieve a comprehensive characterization of the protein-coding genome of Douglas-fir, we exposed young seedlings from different provenances to drought stress treatments and generated normalized cDNA libraries to enrich for rare transcripts or genes not constitutively expressed. All libraries were assembled into a single assembly to maximize the number of reads per transcript and to improve the quality of assembly and SNP annotation. There is a strong relationship between the number of reads and the length http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/673 of a transcript, confirming the observation that longer transcripts consist of more reads than shorter transcripts [33] . The number and average length of the reads of four libraries (DINM, DINS, DIWC, and DIWM) were below expectation [26, 34, 35] , probably because of problems during the sequencing process. However, we did not exclude these libraries, because they contributed the same proportion of reads to the assembly as the other libraries (> 95% of the reads of each library). 94.44% of all reads were assembled into isotigs during assembly, which is a high proportion compared to similar 454 transcriptome assemblies. For example, 88% of reads were assembled in Melitaea cinxia [36] and Eucalyptus grandis [25] , 78% in Pandinus imperator [37] , and 48% in Pinus contorta [26] . One cause for the high proportion in our data is the stringent preprocessing of reads, which excluded most uninformative reads prior to the assembly. The number of PUTs in the assembly (170,859) exceeds the number of expected genes in conifer genomes, which ranges from 30.000 to 50.000 genes [38] . Nevertheless, the PUT set is smaller than the one obtained with Pinus contorta (303,450 transcripts) [26] , but larger than in other 454 transcriptome sequencing projects (e.g. 44,469 transcripts in waterhemp [39] , 108,297 transcripts in a butterfly species [36] ). It should be noted that it is difficult to compare numbers of transcripts in different projects, because they are influenced by the genome and transcriptome sizes of the sequenced organism, the assembly method used [34] , and the number of reads used for the assembly. Overall, the high number of transcripts compared to the expected number of genes is likely a result of incompletely assembled genes.",

Assuming that each unique blast hit represents a different transcribed gene, we tagged 20,604 genes of the Douglas-fir genome. This number is similar to other projects in Pinus contorta with 17,321 tagged genes [26] and is lower than the estimated total number of about 30,000 transcribed genes in white spruce Picea glauca [38] . If we further assume that the number of unique blast hits equals the number of transcribed genes and that the transcriptome sizes of Douglas-fir and white spruce are comparable, it seems that the PUT set generated in this study tags about two thirds of the protein-coding genes of Douglas-fir. The missing third likely comprise (1) cDNAs that were excluded from assembly because of low quality; (2) genes that are expressed at different developmental stages, growth conditions, or tissues and were thus not represented in the twelve cDNA libraries despite the normalization process; and (3) non-conserved genes, which are either lineage-specific and not yet present in the nr database or rapidly evolving genes with e-values > e \u221210 in the BLASTX comparisons. Since about 75% of the transcripts do not result in significant BLASTX hits, one may speculate that a large proportion represents non-conserved genes. Gene Ontologies (GOs) provide a standardized set of terms to describe genes and gene products consistently in different species and databases [41] . GO terms are widely used for annotation and for comparisons of gene products of different species (e.g. [26, 42] ). The similarity of the GO annotation distributions of Douglas-fir PUTs to the well-characterized transcriptome of A. thaliana and the protein sequences of P. sitchensis (Figure 2 ) suggests that the PUT set broadly represents the Douglas-fir transcriptome and can be viewed as being representative for further applications and investigations.",

The isotigs of the m and s groups, but also the ms group, were considered to be top candidates for drought stress tolerance or resistance. However, since most treatment-specific isotigs consist of only two or three reads that originated from a total of twelve cDNA libraries, we reasoned that the power of a statistical model to detect significant differences is low. Therefore, we compared the extent of evolutionary conservation between groups as judged by the proportion of significant BLAST hits. This analysis is based on the notion that widely expressed genes are under stronger selective constraint than treatment-specific genes [43, 44] . Under the assumption that constitutively expressed genes are expressed in all different treatments, we expected that cms group isotigs are more conserved than isotigs from the c, m, and s groups. Since the libraries were normalized and cDNA levels do not represent true expression levels, we restricted our analysis to presence-absence patterns. The differences in the fractions of BLASTX hits in single treatment groups and the cms group suggested that genes expressed in all three treatments are more conserved. However, if groups are corrected for the total amount of sequence data, cms group isotigs are not more conserved than treatment-specific isotigs, because the main determinant for a BLAST hit is isotig length which is longer in cms isotigs (Table 4 ). This pattern was also observed in white spruce [38] . In addition to testing the general hypothesis that treatment-specific genes are less conserved than widelyexpressed genes, we also parsed BLASTX results for drought stress related keywords to find potential drought stress related PUTs. We expect that the 1,503 transcripts with a BLASTX hit containing one of the keywords are probably involved in the Douglas-firs response to drought (Table 3) . More than 1,100 candidate PUTs are part of the cms group and only 134 candidates are part of the m, s, and ms groups. This reflects that the response to drought seems to be mainly facilitated through changes in gene expression levels via up-or down-regulation. The small set of 134 PUTs exclusively induced by drought stress appears to contribute to a specific drought response, but this needs to be further verified because their expression pattern may reflect a sampling artifact. Even though the function of those PUTs may not be conserved across large evolutionary distances, the identified PUTs serve as top candidates for further analysis of sequence and expression variation in comparisons of differentially adapted (e.g. coastal and interior) Douglas-fir provenances.",

The two most important results are the high proportion of shared polymorphisms and the strong influence of the SNP calling algorithm on the number of detected SNPs. By taking a conservative approach and considering only those SNPs that were called by all three programs, only 27,688 (highly reliable) SNPs were obtained, which is only about half of the number detected with gsMapper, which identified the lowest number of SNPs (57, 691) . Since the numbers of called SNPs differed highly between SNP detection tools, our results indicate that SNP calling from next generation sequencing data depend to a high degree on the software tools used. Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution, if relying on a single SNP detection approach only. To our knowledge there are no systematic studies yet that compared the accuracy of different SNP callers with next-generation sequencing data.",

Until now, only around 1,300 SNPs have been identified in Douglas-fir [32, 45] . If only the most reliable SNPs are considered, a key result is the large number of SNPs whose alleles are segregating in both the coastal and interior provenances (15, 483 SNPs, ci/ci category in Table 6 ). In only 5% of SNPs (886, c/i) the two alleles are specific to coastal and interior provenances, respectively. This high proportion of shared polymorphisms indicates either a high level of shared ancestral polymorphisms between the two main Douglas-fir varieties, or recent, possibly pollen-mediated gene flow. The comparison of SNPs, in which only one of the two alleles is shared between coastal and interior provenances suggest a higher level of genetic diversity in coastal provenances because three times as many SNPs are polymorphic for both alleles in the coastal (7, 158 SNPs in the ci/c group) than in the interior accessions (2,547 SNPs in the ci/i group). This difference is also observed for SNPs which were called only in either the interior or coastal provenances because no reads were available from the other provenance, respectively (817 SNPs in the c/c versus 473 SNPs in the i/i group). Although these results are consistent with earlier studies on the genetic diversity of Douglas-fir varieties [46, 47] , they are also certainly influenced by the different numbers of reads originating from coastal and interior cDNA libraries (1,757,542 vs. 1,076,192) . Since there are 70% more reads from the coastal provenances, the probability of finding a polymorphism in these provenances is increased and needs to be accounted for in further conclusions.",

Unbiased population genetic estimators like Tajima's \u03c0 can be calculated from 454 data [50] , but as the coverage at most SNP positions is much smaller than the total number of individuals, the results are not reliable.

Drought stress experiments started after two month of growth in the greenhouse, when visual inspection of the seedlings indicated a well developed root system. For the experiments, seedlings were randomly assigned to one of three different treatments: (1) control seedlings kept under well watered conditions, (2) mildly water stressed seedlings (predawn water potential between -0.7 and -1.0 MPa) and (3) severely water stressed seedlings (predawn water potential between -1.5 and -2.0 MPa). Water stress was imposed by withholding watering until a desired water potential had been reached [11] . Water potential was assessed by repeated measurements of predawn needle water potential using a Scholander pressure chamber to assess the level of water stress [51] . Within about 3-4 and 5-6 weeks, the target water potential was observed in the mildly and severely water stressed seedlings, respectively, and needles and sections of the stem (wood tissue) were harvested. Tissue from control seedlings was harvested in parallel in order to obtain samples from similarly aged plant material. Tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C for later extraction of RNA.",

In the annotation step, functional terms were assigned to the sequences based on the retrieved set of GO terms per sequence using Blast2GO's annotation score. Furthermore, we used a local version of InterProScan [67] (version 4.8) to search protein signatures in the Inter-Pro database [68] . With the local version it was possible to analyze nucleotide sequences in all six possible open reading frames.

The results of the InterProScan were imported into Blast2GO to improve annotations. Annotations were further refined using Annex and GO-Slim, both of which were available within Blast2GO [69, 70] . Annex augments annotations by finding relationships between different GO terms and adding implicit annotations. GO-Slim represents a reduced set of GO terms that gives a useful summary of the all GO terms. Blast2GO provides organism specific GO-Slim mappings of which the plant specific mapping was chosen.

In the first approach, we divided the non-singleton PUTs, i.e. the isotigs, of the assembly by the origin of their reads into seven groups. The groups were named according to the libraries from which the reads were derived (c, m, s, cm, cs, ms, cms, where c stands for control, m for mild stress, and s for severe stress, cm for control and mild stress etc.). The isotigs in the c, m, and s groups were assumed to contain most likely treatmentspecific sequences, as they contained isotigs composed of only reads of one treatment. Therefore, we expected to find drought stress related sequences mainly in the m and s, but also in the ms groups. For the second approach, the BLASTX results were searched for specific keywords to identify candidate genes previously assigned to drought, water stress, or other stress related pathways (Table 3) [ [71] [72] [73] .",

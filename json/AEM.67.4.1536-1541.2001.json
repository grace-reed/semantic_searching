    "abstract": "The coral-bleaching bacterium Vibrio shiloi biosynthesizes and secretes an extracellular peptide, referred to as toxin P, which inhibits photosynthesis of coral symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae). Toxin P was produced during the stationary phase when the bacterium was grown on peptone or Casamino Acids media at 29\u00b0C. Glycerol inhibited the production of toxin P. Toxin P was purified to homogeneity, yielding the following 12-residue peptide: PYPVYAPPPVVP (molecular weight, 1,295.54). The structure of toxin P was confirmed by chemical synthesis. In the presence of 12.5 mM NH Cl, pure natural or synthetic toxin P (10 M) caused a 64% decrease in the photosynthetic quantum yield of zooxanthellae within 5 min. The inhibition was proportional to the toxin P concentration. Toxin P bound avidly to zooxanthellae, such that subsequent addition of NH 4 Cl resulted in rapid inhibition of photosynthesis. When zooxanthellae were incubated in the presence of NH Cl and toxin P, there was a rapid decrease in the pH (pH 7.8 to 7.2) of the bulk liquid, suggesting that toxin P facilitates transport of NH 3 into the cell. It is known that uptake of NH into cells can destroy the pH gradient and block photosynthesis. This mode of action of toxin P can help explain the mechanism of coral bleaching by V. shiloi.",

Coral bleaching events of unprecedented frequency and global extent have been reported during the last two decades (13) . It has been suggested that coral bleaching is triggered by environmental factors which impose stress on the coral. The most frequently reported stress condition is increased seawater temperature (5, 16) . Thus, it is possible that global warming could result in alteration or destruction of coral reef systems. Consequently, it is essential to understand the mechanism(s) of coral bleaching.",

After V. shiloi adheres to O. patagonica, it penetrates into the exodermal layer of the coral (2) . However, the mechanism by which the bacterium kills the algae is unknown. Recently, we reported that V. shiloi secretes extracellular materials that inhibit pho-tosynthesis and bleach and lyse zooxanthellae isolated from corals (4) .

Furthermore, in glycerol-salts medium, V. shiloi grew to a final turbity (A 600 ) of 1.85 but produced no toxin P activity.

Toxin P by itself had no effect on the pH (data not shown). However, addition of toxin P plus 15 mM NH 4 Cl resulted in a large, rapid decrease in the pH, which reached 7.45 after 2 min and 7.2 after 7 min. Thus, toxin P facilitated transport of NH into the algae. Titration of 15 mM NH 4 Cl in seawater from pH 7.8 to 7.2 required 1.7 mM HCl. Thus, ca. 1.7 mM NH 3 (the equivalent amount of NH 4 \u03e9 converting to NH 3 plus H \u03e9 ) must have entered the algae. Accordingly, each toxin molecule (concentration in the experiment, 10 M) must have been responsible for transport of ca. 170 molecules of NH 3 .",

Bound toxin P by itself did not affect algal photosynthesis. However, addition of NH Cl to algae containing the bound toxin resulted in rapid inhibition of photosynthesis and a concurrent decrease in the pH of the bulk liquid. Inhibition of photosynthesis by ammonia is well established (1, 7, 35) . Ammonia acts as an uncoupler of photosynthesis by passing across membranes, thereby destroying the pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane (27, 34) . Many membrane-penetrating peptides, including melittin (33) , gaegurin (29) , cecropin (22) , and buforin (21), contain prolyl residues. Although the exact role of prolyl in the function of these peptides is unknown, proline causes kinks in helical polypeptides and increases the flexibility of peptide chains in its immediate environment. Some of these peptides cause lysis of cell membranes, while others act as ion channel formers (30) . In addition, some membrane-active peptides orient parallel to the bilayer, whereas others orient perpendicular to the plane of the membrane (26) . Very recently, a hydrophilic proline-rich domain from the C terminus of L-type calcium channels was shown to remain membrane associated (11) . Cyclic peptides rich in proline have been found to bind alkali metals (9, 19) . Since toxin P is a dodecapeptide, it cannot traverse the membrane bilayer. However, it could form aggregates of the headto-head or head-to-tail type, as found for gramicidin A. Furthermore, toxin P aggregates in aqueous solution (Fig. 3) , supporting the hypothesis that it can enter the algal membrane and act as an ammonia channel. However, the possibility that ammonia activates toxin P has not been eliminated.",

The toxin is produced only at the elevated seawater temperatures (25 to 30\u00b0C) necessary for bacterial bleaching of corals (16) . Presumably, once V. shiloi penetrates into the coral tissue, it produces toxin P and ammonia (from metabolism of coral cytoplasmic protein). The resulting inhibition of photosynthesis in the intracellular zooxanthellae would damage the algae and contribute to coral bleaching (loss of the algae). It should be noted that the equilibrium of NH \u03e9 dissociation to NH 3 is shifted towards increased NH formation with increasing temperature. For example, three times more NH is produced at 25\u00b0C than at 10\u00b0C at a constant pH and a constant total NH 3 -NH 4 \u03e9 concentration. It should be noted that O. patagonica in the eastern Mediterranean Sea experiences a shift in temperature from 16\u00b0C (winter) to 29 to 30\u00b0C (summer, when bleaching occurs) (16) . This may contribute to magnification of the toxin P-enhanced toxicity of ammonia for zooxanthellae in infected coral during the summer.",

    "abstract": "Soft corals like Sinularia~exibilis (Quoy & Gaimard) and Lobophytum hedleyi (Ehrenberg) inhibit growth and produce tissue necrosis in neighbouring scleractinian corals. Chemical analysis has shown that these soft corals exude terpenes, toxic allelomones which can kill certain hard corals in the vicinity. This study investigates the stepwise process by which soft coral diterpenes induce cytological damage in scleractinian corals. Small branchlets of Acropora formosa (Dana) and Porites cylindrica (Dana) were exposed to concentrations between 5 and 20 ppm of diterpenes derived from S. Jlexibilis and L. hedleyi. Concentrations higher than 5 ppm caused the initial expulsion of zooxanthellae which was followed by release of nematocysts. These processes were accompanied by inhibition of polyp activity, necrosis and ultimate death of coral polyps. The expelled cells were viable supporting the suggestion that the diterpenes act as membrane active, lipolytic agents. The loss of nematocysts and zooxanthellae from a heterotrophic scleractinian coral essentially removes its ability to procure food from the environment in the form of phyto and zooplankton, to defend itself against competitors for space and predators, and to obtain carbohydrates and other organic molecules fixed by photosynthetic symbionts.",

                "text": "Sinularia~exibilis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1833 ) is a fleshy, soft coral whose apparent vulnerability to predation is a contradiction to its successful colonization of available space on reefs. Initial interest was based on field observations that this soft coral inhibited the growth of Pavona cactus in its vicinity, possibly by exuding allelochemicals towards the hard coral (see Coll, 1992) . Field experiments proved that relocated Sinularian colonies can indeed kill neighbouring scleractinian corals and the hypothesis that they do so by releasing chemicals into the water became more compelling (Sammarco et al., 1983) . This was confirmed by the findings of soft coral derived terpenes in the seawater surrounding the soft coral (Co11 et al., 1982) . These allomones (Whittaker & Feeney, 197 1) were identified as flexibilide, dihydroflexibilide and traces of sinulariolide, cembranolide diterpenes which were suspected to be the toxic agents. Although structurally similar, subsequent laboratory experiments showed that they differ in their bioactivities.",

Sinulariolide has been reported to be an algicide (Tursch et al., 1978) , and the same chemicals caused tissue necrosis and death of corals in the laboratory (Co11 & Sammarco, 1983) . Lobophytum spp. (Ehrenberg, 1834) are common soft corals which dominate the intertidal regions of reefs and coastal islands. These corals have fleshy, lobed bodies exposed to predators and like S. Jlexibilis, are rarely preyed upon (Griffiths, 1995) . Many species have been shown to be ichthyotoxic (Co11 & Sammarco, 1983 ), and we have isolated various compounds from Lobophytum species (Co11 et al., 1977 (Co11 et al., , 1986 . Specific Lobophytum ichthyotoxins have been identified including denticulatolide from L. denticulutum (Uchio et al., 1985) , and lobolide and crassolide from L. crassurn (Bowden et al., 1977; Kashman & Groweiss, 1977; Tursch et al., 1978) . Epiphyte-free colonies of Lobophytum contained cembranolides which have antifouling properties (Bowden et al., 1987) , while L. pauciflorum possesses cytotoxic cembranolides (Yamada et al., 1980) . A eudesmanoid diterpene isolated from L. hedleyi (Bowden et al., 1978a,b) and flexibilide from S. Jlexibilis (Kazlauskas et al., 1978) , caused mortality in scleractinian coral polyps exposed to more than 10 ppm concentrations of the compounds (Co11 & Sammarco, 1983 ). The main objective of these experiments was to compare the toxic responses generated by flexibilide from S. JIexibilis and the eudesmanoid diterpene from Loboph_vtum hedleyi, on polyps ofAcroporaformosa (Dana, 1846) and Porites cylindrica (Dana, 1846) . Variations in the effects of flexibilide, dihydroflexibilide and sinulariolide from S. jexibilk on A. formosa were also compared ( Fig. 1 ).",

The zooxanthellae are also critically important to the calcification process in scleractinian corals (Goreau, 1961; Pear-se & Muscatine, 1971 , 1973 .

                "text": "The release of different cells under the influence of terpenes indicates that the terpenes induce dissociation of the individual cells from the coral tissues. More interestingly, the viability of zooxanthellae released seem to point to the fact that this release is due to the dysfunction of membrane junctions, not to zooxanthellae mortality. Viability of the cells after exposure to the terpenes means that the terpenes are not toxic to the zooxanthellae but that they initiate release of the cells from the parent tissue. It implies that these terpenes apparently influence the cell-to-cell junctions so crucial for the organization and integrity of the tissues. This same theory has been proposed by Gates et al. (1992) to explain the detachment of zooxanthellae from the host tissues as the main effect of temperature stress on coral cells. Gates & Muscatine (1992) have also shown that the expelled zooxanthellae are really algal cells with coral protoplasm collapsed around them. Thus, it is not only the zooxanthellae which are still viable, the coral cells released are also still viable. This finding sheds a different light on the results of this experiment, and further reinforces the theory that the diterpenes dissociate cells by destroying cell adhesion molecules. As such, the diterpenes may have some medical value in the treatment of blood clots and thromboses, especially if their cytotoxicity could be modified.",

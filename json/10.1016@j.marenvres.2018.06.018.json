                "text": "Sub-seabed Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is regarded a mitigation technology for the reduction of CO 2 emissions. In the Baltic Sea, the oil-carrying field B3, which is currently operated by the state-owned oil-exploiting company GRUPA LOTOS S.A., is considered to provide an important sink for geological storage of CO 2 . The oil reservoir is located at water depth of 80 m and under the seabed depth of 1450 m in the Polish sector of the Baltic (the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone). The storage is expected to conduct from the existing petroleum platforms in potential conjunction with CO -enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The CO 2 stored in the B3 field is planned to include compressed refinery generated gas (c.a. 450 kt year -1 ) and supercritical CO 2 fluid from the planned IGCC Powerplant (1Mt year -1 ). What is more, after the end of natural gas exploitation, two other neighbouring fields B4 and B6 in the same water-basin may also offer potential capacity for additional CO 2 storage. Both oil and gas fields are located in the tectonically stable area which is covered with the Silurian deposits of thickness ranging from 1000 to 2000 m which shall prevent CO 2 leakage (Zajfert et al., 2015) . Sequestration of CO 2 under the sea floor in depleted/exploited oil and gas reservoirs in the Baltic has been included into long-term strategy of Grupa LOTOS S.A. and the Baltic Sea CO 2 Storage project (BASTOR 2) within the BASREC CCS Network (the Baltic Sea Region Energy Cooperation) (http://basrec.net). The technology is in line with the EU strategy on reduction of CO 2 emission and energy policy of Poland which, according to the CCS Directive of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe 2009/31/WE on geological storage of CO 2 and later directives, is required to reduce substantially anthropogenic CO 2 emission in the coming years. Though sub-seabed CCS is considered as a feasible option and depleted oil and gas reservoirs have usually sufficient seal integrity, storing large volumes of liquid CO 2 raises concerns about environmental risk assessment related to CO 2 leakage from a storage reservoir, its spatial and temporal evolution and effects on the marine environment. Amendments to the London Protocol and OSPAR agreement require that measures for discovery and elimination of possible leaks from sub-M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4 seabed CO 2 storage sites should be taken before CO 2 storage activities are initiated. The OSPAR Guidelines for Risk Assessment and Management of Storage of CO 2 Streams in Geological Formations asks for the \"improvement of impact prediction by gaining knowledge on the effects on species and ecosystems as a result of leakage of CO 2 \" (OSPAR, 2007) . In the brackish Baltic Sea, CCS has not been implemented yet and the potential impact of CO 2 leakage on the marine ecosystem can be assessed only based on laboratory studies (e.g. Jansson et al., 2013 Jansson et al., , 2016 Jakubowska and Normant-Saremba, 2015; Soko\u0142owski et al., 2018) or research field experiments in fully-saline water-basins (e.g. Lichtschlag et al., 2015) .",

Although such effects are spatially constrained, significant point-source leak will affect neighbouring areas creating a pH gradient in the near-bottom zone, thus influencing gradually benthic organisms (Baxter et al., 1989) . Controlled laboratory experiments (e.g., Lee et al., 2016) , exposure experiments in situ (e.g., Ishida et al., 2013) and studies at natural CO 2 seeps (e.g., Allen et al., 2017) have been therefore performed in a range of seawater acidity to assess biological responses under various leakage scenarios and under different pH conditions (e.g., CO2MARINE; ECO2, 2014). The general mechanisms proposed through which CO 2 leakage could impact benthic species and communities (for review see Kroeker et al., 2013) are not, however, necessarily uniform across different taxa or environmental conditions (Walther et al., 2010) . For example, divergent patterns of compensative/defensive biological traits and metabolic performance were documented for the Baltic clam Limecola (former Macoma) balthica from the brackish non-tidal southern Baltic Sea. The bivalve demonstrated behavioural and physiological responses as well as reduction in shell growth at seawater pH 7.0 while responses to more acidic conditions (pH 6.3) were mitigated. This indicated a high tolerance of this species to severe hypercapnia presumably stemming from its adaptation to natural variations in interstitial water CO 2 concentration associated with the mineralization of sediment organic matter (Soko\u0142owski et al., 2018) .

Special caution is therefore advised when inferences about the effects of seawater acidification on Baltic benthic species are drawn based on results from other coastal areas (Havenhand, 2012) . So far, research of the impact of increased seawater acidity due to potential CO leak on marine invertebrates in the Baltic has not been performed except the very recent study of Soko\u0142owski et al. (2018) . Together with increasing demand for commercial-scale CO 2 storage and for better understanding of the environmental risk due to potential leakage, this induces an urgent need for more mesocosm experiments on the Baltic animals (Havenhand, 2012) . In particular, studies using biochemical markers (e.g. high energetic sources, compounds that are involved in cellular defence, stress enzymes) are of interests as they provide clues about immediate physiological responses of an organism to increases in seawater pCO 2 and hypercapnic stress. The responses observed in marine benthic faunal species may also serve as important indicators in future environmental monitoring and early-warning systems for CO 2 leaking from geological storage sites (Ishida et al., 2013) in order to improve the risk assessment and management.",

Since the bivalve shows broad tolerance of adverse environmental conditions, including trace metal pollution, oxygen deficit and even temporal presence of hydrogen sulphide (Jahn and Theede, 1997; Soko\u0142owski et al., 2004) , its potential to cope with severe seawater acidification was evaluated.",

Phenotypic effects at the whole-organism level occur, however, later after changes at the genomic and biochemical level (e.g. alterations in metabolic enzyme activities) are observed. For instance, Kaniewska et al. (2012) reported changes in gene expression and cell physiology far before a decrease in calcification rates (phenotypic effect) was noticed in the reef-building coral Acropora millepora in response to seawater acidification. Shifts in the gross energetic resources (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins) are thus a consequence of the immediate biochemical reactions (e.g. enzymatic protein activity) but can also reflect far-reaching and serious organism disruption resulting in altered energy reallocation in response to stress. On longer time scales (days-weeks), such shifts might lead to reduction in organism performance (e.g., reduced growth rate and development) and even to death if environmental perturbations are in excess of organisms' tolerance limit.",

Such an action enables access to oxygen and/or food and simultaneously limits exposure of the bivalves to the interstitial water, while supporting both feeding and respiration.

The low carbohydrates and glycogen contents of soft tissue ash dry weight of Limecola balthica in the pH 7.0 treatment as compared to the bivalves kept at seawater pH 6.3 and 7.7 indicate worse performance of the former. Though not significant, a similar U-shape pattern with apparently lowered values under moderate hypercapnic conditions was also observed for lipids (Fig. 2) which constitute the principal energy reserves in bivalves (Zandee et al. 1980) . A decreased storage of caloric reserves resulted inevitably from their catabolism in order to cover increased metabolic requirements in defensive/compensatory reaction to moderate seawater acidity.

When increased energy demands on defence are in excess of available reserves and energy acquisition from food, this can cause the death of an organism (Bayne and Newell, 1983) as shown by a decreased survival rate of L. balthica at lower seawater pH (Soko\u0142owski et al., 2018) . Under conditions of permanent and sufficient food supply, elevated energy expenditure of the Baltic clam on counteracting acidosis and maintenance of internal acid-balance at seawater pH 7.0 is covered by energy acquisition from phytoplanktonic food (Soko\u0142owski et al., 2018 ) and a simultaneous breakdown of energetic reserves. Enhanced catabolism of energetic resources was also indicated by a loss of individual soft tissue ash dry weight of bivalves from the 7.0 treatment (on average by ca. 5.3%) relative to the control clams (Soko\u0142owski et al., 2018) . It is noteworthy that exposure to seawater pH 7.0 imposed a simultaneous increase of the protein content, a pattern which is in stark contrast to most invertebrate studies on pH physiological regulatory mechanisms (e.g. Donohue et al., 2012) . Proteins serve as an important intracellular non-bicarbonate buffer (Thomsen and Melzner, 2010) and contribute to oxygen transport in haemolymph in marine and coastal molluscs (e.g. P\u00f6rtner et al., 2008; Melzner et al., 2009) . Increased breakdown of proteins and/or reduced rate of protein synthesis occurs thus often in hypercapnic bivalves which shift from carbohydrate/lipid-based energy metabolism to amino acid catabolism (Zhao et al., 2017) . Such a reduction of proteins under acidic conditions was reported, for example, in the clam Ruditapes decussatus from the Ria Formosa shallow lagoon on the Atlantic coast of Portugal (Range et al., 2014) and in the blood clam Tegillarca granosa from the Yueqing Bay, China (Zhao et al., 2017) . On the other hand, Matozzo et al. (2012) observed increased protein levels in haemolymph of the clam Chamelea gallina and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to lowered pH (8.1-control, 7.7 and 7.4) and suggested that it could be related to modifications of serum components, i.e. activation of certain enzymes and/or proteins released from haemocytes into the haemolymph under acidic stress. Further study on activity of enzymes, which are involved in metabolic and defensive processes such as oxygen metabolism, antioxidative defence, acid-based balance and neurotransmission, is needed, however, to corroborate this hypothesis.",

Such small variations in the soft tissue protein (1.1) and glycogen (1.4\u00f72.8) contents were also found in the same clam species after short-term experimental exposure to elevated dissolved Cu concentration (Soko\u0142owski et al., 1999) . The bivalves are therefore expected to have a certain level of pre-adaptation to adverse environmental conditions, including trace metal contamination (Soko\u0142owski et al., 1999) and acidification (Soko\u0142owski et al., 2018) . Owing to high natural interstitial water pH variability in organic-rich surface sediments of the Baltic (down to pH 7.0; Jansson et al., 2016) , which is related organic matter mineralization, the bivalves experience likely acidified conditions during their larval and/or ontogenic life stages, allowing to develop efficient defensive/compensatory mechanisms towards high environmental pCO 2 . Pre-adaptation through lifestyle and/or ontogeny was proposed as an explanatory hypothesis of low sensitivity of selected marine faunal species to seawater acidification in extensive review by Melzner et al., (2009) . Based on experimental study Talmage and Gobler (2010) suggested that pre-adaptive mechanism accounted for greater growth and survival and greater percentage metamorphosis of larvae of the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria and the bay scallop Argopecten irradians after exposure to the elevated CO 2 level (1500 ppm). According to Parker et al. (2013) such a pre-adaptation of some marine mollusc species to reduced seawater pH can undergo based on either evolutionary adaptation or environmental phenotypic plasticity within a generation (acclimation). Indeed, Thomsen and Melzner (2010) found that long-term acclimation to elevated environmental pCO2 increases the ability to calcify in the mussel Mytilus spp. from the Kiel Fjord in the western Baltic Sea. Similarly, Schade et al. (2017) ",

Temporal dynamics of the clam response to a decline in seawater pH included a 7 day (pH 6.3 and 7.7) or 14 day (pH 7.0) phase of increased metabolic turnover associated with catabolism of the main energetic resources followed by a recovery of carbohydrates and lipids to a level which was observed at the beginning of the ",

Physiological mechanisms behind this remarkable response remain unclear and further studies at cellular and enzymatic levels are needed to detect metabolic pathways which enable the clams to cope efficiently with acute CO 2 stress. One hypothesis includes energy gain from chemical oxidation of organic or inorganic molecules through chemoautotrophism. It has been documented that some bivalve species inhabiting deep anoxic and acidic environments (e.g. the hydrothermal vent vesicomyid clam Calyptogena magnifica) develop chemoautotrophic endosymbiosis with bacteria which utilise reduced sulphur compounds (sulphide or in the reducing substrates to provide energy and carbon to their host.",

HSP70 was reported to play an important role also in adaptation of marine molluscs to hypercapnic stress. O'Donnell et al.(2009)  described increased relative expression of HSP70 (measured with qPCR) in response to elevated pCO 2 levels (380 ppm, 540 ppm and 970 ppm) in larvae of the red sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus and found that the enhanced CO 2 concentration inhibited the ability of the echinoderms to regulate expression of molecular chaperones. On the other hand, down-regulation of genes encoding the intracellular 70 kDa protein HSP70a by elevation of seawater CO 2 was described in the CO 2 -resilient oyster Saccostrea glomerata byGoncalves et al. (2017).Wang et al. (2017) demonstrated that individuals of the limpet the bivalves to lowered pH in medium-term experiment included likely biosynthesis of conservative HSP70 but this cause-and-effect relation was subtle. Combining this observation with moderate response of the energetic reserves and the biochemical condition index suggests that hypercapnia exerted a limited effect on biochemical markers of L. balthica to CO 2 stress. Such a response of the infaunal bivalves to CO 2 -induced seawater acidification is presumably attributed to larval and/or ontogenic pre-adaptation to acidic conditions in its natural habitat, highlighting the importance of life history traits and environmental factors in assessing the potential impact of reduced pH on benthic biota in marine and coastal systems.4.3 Variations of biochemical descriptors over timeAll biochemical descriptors measured (except HSP70) demonstrated apparent variation during the course of the exposure period allowing to track temporal dynamics of bivalve's defensive and protective responses to reduction of seawater pH. Small differences in the glycogen content (particularly in the pH 7.0 treatment) were observed at the beginning of the exposure period (0d). Since neither physiological condition (as indicated by the morphometric condition indices CI1 and Ci2) nor the metabolic activity of the Baltic clams (as shown by oxygen consumption rate) differed among pH treatments at that time(Soko\u0142owski et al. 2018), the differences resulted likely from temporarily enhanced energy requirements presumably related to a change of the experimental conditions. A CO 2 -induced increase of seawater acidity elicited a gradual decrease of carbohydrates, glycogen and BCI over the first 7 days (particularly at seawater pH 6.3 and 7.7) which were accompanied by increased oxygen consumption rate (used as surrogate of metabolic level;Soko\u0142owski et al., 2018).Catabolism of energetic reserves of fast metabolic turnover and elevated respiration activity indicated augmented energy requirements of the bivalves for compensation of acidosis and maintaining of internal acid-bases balance(Michaelidis et al., 2005). A markedly larger drop of carbohydrate content in the pH 6.3 and 7.7 treatments (39.1% and 37.7%, respectively) relative to the pH 7.0 conditions (14.8%) can indicate simultaneous adverse impact of",

A different time-scale pattern occurred in the pH 7.0 treatment. Carbohydrates and glycogen contents (and BCI) deceased substantially until 14 d suggesting the still ongoing energy-demanding defensive processes in L. balthica. Despite unlimited highly-nutritive phytoplanktonic food supply, extra energy for maintenance and regulation of acid-base status was gained then through additional catabolic reactions of energetic resources underlining a different response of the clams at seawater pH 7.0.Interestingly, in all pH treatments proteins dropped substantially (by from 4.7 to 23.9%) within the first 14 days of exposure that resulted presumably from the reduction of protein synthesis",

In combination with moderate metabolism of the clams, their active burrowing behaviour into deeper sediment layers and smaller declines in shell growth, i.e. indicators of improved physiological status (Soko\u0142owski et al., 2018), this may point at 28-42 day acclimatization period of L. balthica to elevated seawater pCO2. In the pH 7.0 treatment, a diminishing trend of protein content and a parallel increase in carbohydrates and HSP70 was observed between 28 d and 42 d of the experiment. The response can be attributed to temporal decrease of interstitial water oxygen concentration and sediment pH reduction in the buckets which diminished by 0.43 during 14 days as indicated also by DistLM.

ConclusionsSeawater acidification in a range which simulated changes in acidity of the overlying bottom water after potential carbon dioxide leakage from the sub-seabed CCS site disrupted gross energy metabolism of the Baltic clam Limecola balthica only under the moderate hypercapnic conditions (pH 7.0) while no clear effect was evident at seawater pH 6.3. The modest acidic environment (pH 7.0) induced elevated catabolism of high caloric reserves of fast metabolic turnover (carbohydrates including glycogen and partly lipids) in order to provide additional energy to cover enhanced metabolic requirements for acid-base regulation. Increased metabolism of the bivalves did not involve, however, breakdown of proteins, suggesting that amino acids and proteins were not used as metabolic substrates. The clams demonstrated thus broad tolerance and large pre-adapted capacity for seawater acidification through development of efficient defensive/compensatory mechanisms of acute acidosis as indicated also by subtle variations in the chaperone protein HSP70",

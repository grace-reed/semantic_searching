    "abstract": "Microplastic pollution is pervasive in aquatic environments, but the potential effects of microplastics on aquatic organisms are still under debate. Given that tissue damage is unavoidable in fish and the available data mostly concentrate on healthy fish, there is a large chance that the ecotoxicological risk of microplastic pollution is underrated. Therefore, in this study, the effects of microplastics on the regenerative capacity of injured fish were investigated using a zebrafish caudal fin regeneration model. After fin amputation at 72 h post fertilization, the larvae were exposed to polystyrene microplastics (0.1 e10 mg/L) with diameters of 50 or 500 nm. Microplastic exposure significantly inhibited fin regeneration, both morphologically and functionally. Furthermore, the signaling networks that regulate fin regeneration, as well as reactive oxygen species signaling and the immune response, both of which are essential for tissue repair and regeneration, were altered. Transcriptomic analyses of the regenerating fin confirmed that genes related to fin regeneration were transcriptionally modulated in response to microplastic exposure and that metabolic pathways were also extensively involved. In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first time that microplastic exposure could disrupt the regenerative capacity of fish and might eventually impair their fitness in the wild.",

Microplastics are also purposefully manufactured, including microbeads for personal care products (Ivleva et al., 2017; Rochman et al., 2015) . It has been reported that microplastic pollution are present in virtually all environmental niches, including freshwater and marine ecosystems, as the aquatic environment represents a sink for a large proportion of microplastics (Wilcox et al., 2015) . Therefore, it is highly likely that aquatic organisms will encounter these emerging contaminants, resulting in potential ecotoxicological consequences. Existing evidence has demonstrated that microplastic exposure can elicit several adverse effects on fish, including gastrointestinal damage, disturbances in energy metabolism, altered behavior performance, endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and so on (SAPEA, 2019; Barboza et al., 2018; de Sa et al., 2018; Pannetier et al., 2020) .",

On the other hand, injured organisms are hypothesized to be more susceptible to the effects of environmental contaminants. However, to date, studies regarding the toxicity of microplastics have mostly concentrated on healthy organisms rather than injured ones, potentially underrating the detrimental consequences of microplastic pollution at the population level. In addition, it is now firmly established that microplastic exposure results in direct physical harm, including internal abrasions and internal and external wounds (Horton et al., 2017; Ivleva et al., 2017) , which highlights the necessity of exploring the effects of microplastics on the capacity for repair and regeneration in injured aquatic organisms, including fish.",

Control groups (with amputation) exposed to only dechlorinated tap water were included. Fish were allowed to regenerate for various times. The solutions were renewed daily, and the fish were not fed. For comparison, normal (no amputation) larvae in dechlorinated tap water were set up in parallel and were anesthetized and recovered in the same way.",

Effects of microplastics on the mRNA and protein levels of genes involved in the signaling networks regulating fin regeneration Transcriptional changes in genes involved in the signaling networks regulating fin regeneration, including Wnt/b-catenin, bone morphogenic protein (BMP), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), insulinlike growth factor (IGF), Notch, retinoic acid (RA), activin, and Hedgehog (Hh) pathways, and of two markers of cell proliferation in the fin (mps1 and pcna), were shown in Fig. 2A . It was found that amputation induced the mRNA expression of most regenerationrelated genes. After microplastic exposure, the mRNA levels of most genes in the Wnt/b-catenin pathway were changed in a similar way at 12 hpa, with an increase followed by slight reduction. However, these genes tended to increase at 72 hpa with increasing concentrations, especially for in the 500-nm microplastic-treated groups. For instance, after exposure to 500-nm microplastics for 12 h, the mRNA level of axin2 was decreased concentrationdependently, with a significant difference at 10 mg/L. However, at 72 hpa, an increasing trend of axin2 was observed, which became significant at 10 mg/L. Most genes in other signaling pathways, including FGF, BMP, Hh, IGF, and activin, and two proliferation markers, appeared to have transcriptional profiles similar to that of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway. However, in the RA pathway, no change in rbp2a mRNA levels was observed at 12 hpa, while a significant decrease was found at 72 hpa after exposure to 500-nm microplastics. Regarding the Notch pathway, microplastic exposure led to no change in the mRNA levels of gata 6 and mfap4.",

Moreover, the protein levels of three cytokines (Il-10, Tnf-a, and Nf-kB) were determined (Fig. 3D) . Amputation increased the relative levels of all three cytokines at 12 hpa, which then declined at 72 hpa, returning to levels similar to that of the normal (no amputation) fish.

Similarly, the injection of polystyrene microplastics (700 nm) induced the systemic immune response of zebrafish larvae (Veneman et al., 2017) . However, in coral, immune capacity was significantly suppressed after exposure to polystyrene microplastics with a diameter of 1.0 mm (Tang et al., 2018) .

Wounds result in ROS production and are essential for subsequent regeneration in zebrafish (Gauron et al., 2013) . The observed oxidant/antioxidant status in the controls, as indicated by mRNA level and enzyme activity, as well as ROS levels and lipid peroxidation product content (Fig. 4 & S4) , were completely consistent with the expectation. On the other hand, exposure to xenobiotics could stimulate ROS production, and excess ROS results in oxidative damage and further impairments at the cellular or physiological level. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that oxidative damage might be an important mechanism of toxicity for microplastic exposure (SAPEA, 2019; Franzellitti et al., 2019; Jeong et al., 2016) . Oxidative stress induced by microplastics has been reported in zebrafish following larval (Chen et al., 2017) or adult exposure (Lei et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2016) and was found to persist in offspring after parental exposure (Pitt et al., 2018b) . The results observed here clearly indicated that microplastic exposure significantly changed the oxidant/antioxidant status of the fish in the amputation groups (Fig. 4&S4) . Specifically, microplastic exposure induced the production of ROS; low levels of ROS activate antioxidant enzymes, while excess ROS tend to decrease antioxidant capacity and result in the accumulation of peroxidation products. However, in contrast to the enzyme activities, the mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes were found to be increased at 72 hpa as part of a compensatory response. Since ROS signaling is concentration dependent (Gauron et al., 2013) , the change in oxidant/ antioxidant status might contribute to the inhibitory effects of microplastics on fin regeneration. Moreover, given that cell apoptosis was supposed to be induced by a high ROS level (at least partially), the change in the amount of apoptotic cells in the trunk (Fig. S5) , accompanied by histological alterations on the amputation plane, such as damaged mitochondria (Fig. S6) , provided further support for this argument.",

It was interesting to note that in contrast to the large number of upregulated transcripts after amputation, the major DEGs induced by microplastic exposure were downregulated (Fig. 5C ). Moreover, the comparative analysis of DEGs with a Venn diagram clearly revealed a high degree of similarity between the amputation-induced and microplasticsinduced DEGs (Fig. 5D ). All these observations led to the proposal that transcriptional modulation (generally downregulation) of these genes involved in fin regeneration could be responsible for the inhibitory effects of microplastics on fin regeneration. RNA-seq results of genes which were suggested to be specifically linked to tissue repair and regeneration ( Fig. 6) , as well as those related to cytokines and oxidative stress, were found to be consistent with the expectation. It was also important to note that size-dependent effects were demonstrated from RNA-seq results, although this effect was not detected with the other endpoints assessed in this study.",

The noticeable changes in molecules related to metabolism in the transcriptomic responses to amputation observed here were consistent with previous studies conducted using microarray (Mathew et al., 2009; Yoshinari et al., 2009) . For instance, the upregulated genes related to metabolism represented the most abundant functional group (40%) in the regenerating fin fold of zebrafish larvae (Yoshinari et al., 2009) . Exposure to the microplastics with different polymers has been extensively demonstrated to modulate metabolism in fish and other organisms (Brandts et al., 2018; LeMoine et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2016; Mattsson et al., 2015; Sussarellu et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2019) . For example, a whole animal transcriptomic approach found that the ingestion of polyethylene microplastics (10e45 mm) by developing zebrafish caused profound changes in cellular metabolic pathways, and the majority of these genes were downregulated (LeMoine et al., 2018). Another study reported that metabolomic profiles were disturbed in the liver of zebrafish and suggested that the alteration of lipid and energy metabolism was the primary response to the exposure of polystyrene microplastics (70 nm and 5 mm) (Lu et al., 2016) .",

The ECM is believed to play a critical role in tissue repair and regeneration, and its misregulation could ultimately result in the inhibition of cell migration and the distribution of signaling molecules (Andreasen et al., 2007; Nauroy et al., 2019) . The ECM-receptor interaction pathway was also significantly enriched after exposure to 50-nm microplastics for 72 h. Moreover, the pathways essential for fin regeneration, such as retinol metabolism and Hh signaling, were impacted after microplastic exposure ( Fig. S10 ). It should be emphasized that only regenerating caudal fins were sampled for RNA-seq, yet multiple metabolic pathways, rather than those specific to wound repair and regeneration, were predominantly modulated. It would be expected that if the exposure triggered a shift in energy allocation in response to xenobiotic stress, the metabolic expenditures for tissue repair and regeneration should be reduced correspondingly. Therefore, the changes of metabolic pathways, which mostly considered as general responses, should be underlined in future regeneration studies.",

Oral exposure (via the gastrointestinal tract) and dermal exposure (via the epidermis or gills) are considered to be the most likely routes for the uptake of polystyrene particles (25 and 50 nm) from the surrounding medium (van Pomeren et al., 2017) . However, the presence of fluorescence in the area of the regenerating caudal fin (Fig. S8 ), nevertheless faint, suggested that the tissue of the amputated plane was penetrable and might be an additional route for microplastic uptake. All these exposure routes might account for the observed fin regeneration.",

The signaling networks regulating fin regeneration, as well as ROS signaling and immune responses, were altered after microplastic exposure and were speculated to contribute to the inhibitory effects. Additionally, transcriptomic analyses revealed that genes related to fin regeneration were transcriptionally modulated in response to microplastic exposure, and metabolic pathways were found to be extensively involved. Size-dependent effects were implied from RNA-seq data and deserve further exploration. Given that the toxic effects of microplastics were previously generally assessed in the context of healthy organisms, this study expanded our understanding of the potential effects of microplastic pollution and was likely to pave the way toward a more definite answer to this global problem.

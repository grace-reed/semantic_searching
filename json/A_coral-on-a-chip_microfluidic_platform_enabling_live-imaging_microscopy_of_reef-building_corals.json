Our understanding of these threats is hampered by the lack of robust approaches for studying the micro-scale interactions between corals and their environment.

The small and transparent coral micropropagates are ideally suited for live-imaging microscopy, while the microfluidic platform facilitates long-term visualization under controlled environmental conditions. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by imaging coral micropropagates at previously unattainable spatio-temporal resolutions, providing new insights into several micro-scale processes including coral calcification, coral-pathogen interaction and the loss of algal symbionts (coral bleaching). Coral-on-a-chip thus provides a powerful method for studying coral physiology in vivo at the micro-scale, opening new vistas in coral biology.",

This partnership allows corals to proliferate in tropical, nutrient-poor waters, where they form the backbone of the coralreef ecosystem and its associated biodiversity . Further, while covering less than 0.1% of the ocean surface, the activity of coral reefs has a significant impact on global climate, as coral calcification is estimated to sequester 70-90 million tons of carbon per year 3 , exceeding 10% of marine calcium carbonate mineralization. Over the past several decades, concomitant with global rise in sea-surface temperatures, coral reefs have undergone continual decline due to disease outbreaks, including mass bleaching events 4, 5 , leading to a large increase in research efforts into the physical and biological processes governing coral-reef health and proliferation under changing environmental conditions 3, [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

Studying corals at the colony scale therefore fails to capture biological processes occurring at the tissue or cellular levels, and how these processes are affected by environmental stress. Tissue or cellular level coral physiology has been studied extensively using microscopic methods including histology, electron microscopy and more recently nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry [11] [12] [13] [14] . While these methods provide a wealth of information regarding cellular and subcellular structures, they require fixation of tissues prior to imaging and so are limited in their ability to follow dynamic processes in vivo at relevant time scales. An alternative approach is the generation of miniaturized model systems in the form of cell or tissue cultures that could be studied in vitro in real time. Such miniaturized model systems have yielded valuable insights into the physiological processes involved in symbiosis and calcification [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, the process of disrupting the coral tissue to generate cell or tissue cultures necessarily results in loss of the tissue organization and hence the organismal context of resulting observations. Moreover, as all coral cell or tissue cultures reported to date have limited lifespans of up to 3 weeks 15, 16, 18 , the cells or tissues in such cultures are in a state of declining health, likely stressed and thus may not represent the full spectrum of coral physiological and metabolic processes.",

Unlike cell or tissue cultures, micropropagation preserves much of the organization of the whole organism, enabling the study of cells or tissues in their uncompromised physiological state. Furthermore, micropropagation enables the rapid production of a large number of clonal organisms with highly similar life histories, thus reducing complexity and simplifying experimental design. Such systems have been particularly useful in the plant sciences, where they are routinely used for comparative analysis of tissues or whole organisms, plant crop production, and conservation and restoration 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] . A number of, micropropagation systems have been developed for cnidarian species, most notably the freshwater Hydra polyp 26, 27 , the sea anemones Aiptasia and Nematostella 1, 28, 29 and more recently the solitary scleractinian coral Fungia granulosa 21, 30 .",

The development of microfluidic flow systems, where environmental parameters can be precisely controlled and monitored, together with advances in microscopic imaging techniques have opened new frontiers in the study of cellular and microbial systems [31] [32] [33] , organs 34 , and whole organisms 35 . Recently, we demonstrated the use of microfluidics in studying the chemotactic response of a bacterial pathogen towards coral mucus , as well as the dynamic microenvironment generated by ciliary vortices at the surface of reef-building corals 37 . Introducing coral micropropagates into a microfluidic setting has the potential to provide a powerful new platform for in vivo visualization of coral physiological processes at microscopic resolution, under controlled conditions and over extended time periods. To this end, we developed a robust method for the micropropagation of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis, and two additional coral species, and for the integration of resulting micropropagates into a microfluidic flow system. We demonstrate the strength of this novel system, which we term coral-on-a-chip, by performing live-imaging microscopy of eco-physiological processes in reef-building corals, providing a new and powerful experimental approach to study the biology and ecology of reef corals.",

Coral micropropagates are generated by polyp explantation induced by a natural stress response previously termed 'polyp-bail-out' 38 . We induce this type of response in a controlled manner by subjecting coral fragments to a gradual increase in salinity, to which P. damicronis corals ( Fig. 2a ) used in our experiments respond in a highly predictable manner ( Fig. 2b ; Supplementary Movie 1). Polyp retraction is typically observed at salinities of 42-45 p.p.t., followed by stretching and thinning of the coenosarc (the tissue connecting adjacent polyps) at B50 p.p.t. Severing of the coenosarc occurs at 52-54 p.p.t., rapidly followed by separation of the polyp tissue from the skeleton. It should be noted that the precise salinity for each stage of the explantation process varies, depending on colony health and possibly also on its origin. Nevertheless the occurrence of polyp-bail-out on salinity increase and the sequence of steps described above are robust and lead to the expulsion of over 90% of the polyps from each fragment.",

In Stylophora pistillata, stretching and thinning of the coenosarc tissue is induced in a similar manner to P. damicornis, but is not followed by polyp expulsion.

Gross polyp morphology, including polyp mouth (stomodaeum) and tentacles, is retained throughout the micropropagation and settlement process. To induce settlement, micropropagates are placed in small microwells (3 mm diameter \u00c2 1 mm depth) fabricated on a microscope slide. Slides with micropropagates are incubated in a custom raceway system under controlled light, temperature and flow conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Initial attachment to the glass surface is observed within 12 h of polyp explantation, followed by flattening of the polyp base against the glass surface and extension of tentacles over a period of 24-48 h ( Fig. 2c ). Calcification (Figs 2g; 3) is observed within 2-4 days of settlement. Settled micropropagates can be maintained for periods of weeks to months, either in the raceway system or in aquaria. Under the experimental conditions used here, up to 90% of micropropagates from a single P. damicornis fragment could be induced to settle onto glass microscope slides. However, this rate of success depends on colony health and water quality, with settlement rates in some of our experiments dropping below 10% when conditions in the aquarium deteriorated.",

The coral-ona-chip platform allows us to follow bleaching and disease processes in live coral polyps at the single-cell level (Fig. 4 ). Using our system, we can introduce fluorescently tagged pathogens into the microchannel, and to follow their interaction with the coral micropropagate by live-imaging microscopy. To overcome the autofluorescent background of the coral host, we transformed the established coral pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus strain YB2 (ref. 41 ) with a plasmid encoding for the DsRed.T3 fluorescent protein (Fig. 4a,b) . The emission wavelength of this protein, together with its high quantum yield, makes it readily distinguishable from the strong autofluorescence of both the coral's native GFP and the chlorophyll of its algal symbionts. By adding these transformed pathogens to the microfluidic channel we were able to follow the infection process in real time, including the accumulation V. coralliilyticus cells within the polyp's gastrovascular cavity (Fig. 4a,b , blue dots). By exposing settled micropropagates to high light intensities we can induce the coral to lose its algal symbionts, thus bringing the process of coral bleaching into our microfluidic channel. By this method, we can observe and measure the bleaching process at high spatio-temporal resolution. This is demonstrated here for a micropropagate consisting of three coral polyps, where exposure to high light intensity (2,500 mmol photons per m 2 per s) over a period of 8 h results in the near-complete loss of its zooxanthellae ( Fig. 4c; Supplementary Movie 3) . Bleaching is not uniform, but appears to progress from the coenosarc tissue towards the polyps' centre. Using simple image analysis we extracted quantitative measurements of chlorophyll autofluorescence for the entire micropropagate, revealing a doubling in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4e) . These results were further validated by studying the bleaching process at single-cell resolution, providing additional insights into the micro-scale dynamics of coral bleaching. Specifically, our results demonstrate different response kinetics for neighbouring individual symbionts (Fig. 4d,f) . One striking result is that the loss of an algal cell is often preceded by elevated fluorescence intensity of its chlorophyll. In the example given here, the chlorophyll autofluorescence of the alga marked by a red arrow (red curve in 4f) is first seen to intensify at 0915 hours. It then remains high for the next hour, after which the algal cell disappears. A neighbouring symbiont, which appears to be physically linked to the affected cell (blue arrow; blue curve in 4f), is relatively unaffected during the capture period.",

The scale of observation, the minute amount of tissue and the small working volume differ substantially from conventional experimental macro-scale approaches in coral studies, where the unit of observation is usually a small colony or branch, either in situ or in aquaria. This system also differs from the use of dissociated coral cells or cell aggregates, previously suggested as a possible alternative for micro-scale studies of coral physiology [15] [16] [17] . Cell dissociation inevitably results in loss of tissue spatial organization, altering the physical and chemical microenvironment experienced by the studied sample. The unique microscopic view of settled coral micropropagates thus opens a new window into coral physiology at resolutions down to the single-cell level. The clonality of multiple micropropagates derived from a single mother colony simplifies experimental design by reducing genetic variability, allowing to reliably compare the effects of different treatments. The ability to integrate coral micropropagates into a microfluidic device allows, for the first time in coral studies, the use of ong-term microscopic observation, and opens the use of a whole suite of analytical tools developed for similar microfluidic platforms 44, 45 .",

Calcification and skeletogenesis, processes that underlie the development of coral reefs 17, 46, 47 , are among the most studied aspects of coral physiology. These subjects have received increased attention in light of global environmental changes, particularly ocean acidification 43, 48, 49 . Nevertheless, the underlying micro-scale processes of calcification remain poorly understood, largely because of the difficulty in observing the calcifying layer in the live coral without disturbing the calcification process 47, 50, 51 . In light of the importance of the calcification process, and the research attention it receives, it was imperative to first verify that calcification in coral micropropagates is representative of that in intact colonies. To do so, we used the fluorescent dye calcein, which is incorporated into calcium carbonate crystals 39, 40 during skeletal growth ( Fig. 3a-d) . Calcein is known to be preferentially incorporated at specific sites within the coral skeleton, designated centres of calcification 47, 50 , typically associated with protruding skeletal elements such as spinules and septa. Our results indeed demonstrate localized calcein incorporation (Fig. 3b) at protruding elements subsequently shown to resemble spinules and septa by SEM imaging (Fig. 3c,d ). These results indicate that coral micropropagates indeed retain the basic calcification and skeleton morphology properties of the mother colony, and are thus a promising experimental system for the microscopic study of these important processes.",

The ability to precisely control and manipulate the environmental parameters experienced by the coral micropropagate will enable future studies into the effects of different environmental stresses on the deposition of specific skeletal elements. Only one system to date, the lateral skeleton preparative (LSP) assay 52 , provides comparable spatial resolution when studying in vivo coral calcification. Using the LSP essay, the expanding edge of a small coral fragment attached to a glass slide can be imaged microscopically. Our system offers several advantages over LSP preparations, including improved clonality, shortened generation times (from several weeks to just a few days), and most importantly, flexible experimental design due to the ability to precisely control the environmental parameters during microscopic imaging. Thus, coral-on-a-chip provides a unique platform for studying the micro-scale processes underlying coral calcification.",

Here we demonstrate the use of the coral-on-achip platform to study the infection of a P. damicornis micropropagate with its well-established pathogen, V. coralliilyticus 41, 55 , a major cause of coral disease. By fluorescently tagging the bacterial pathogens, we were able to show how, during the infection process, V. coralliilyticus enters the gastrovascular cavity via the polyp's stomadeum (Fig. 4a,b) . This result suggests a hitherto underexplored route to coral infection, while representing a first in vivo observation of a bacterial pathogen inside a coral polyp.",

This resulted in a rapid and repeatable breakdown of the coral-algae symbiosis, which allowed us to track and measure the loss of algal symbionts in real time at both the polyp and single-cell levels ( Fig. 4c-f ; Supplementary Movies 3 and 4 ). We observed a sharp increase in the autofluorescence of algal chlorophyll as part of the bleaching process, suggesting breakdown of the photosynthetic process 56 . Our results indicate that susceptibility of the algal symbionts to high light conditions is affected by their localization within the coral polyp, and possibly by some degree of innate variability. Moreover, the loss of symbionts is shown to be highly selective, with cells separated by only a few micrometres showing different bleaching kinetics. This suggests specific signalling between coral and algae, possibly mediated by the induction of reactive oxygen species [57] [58] [59] , which needs to be further explored.",

The branch tip is placed in an open glass Petri dish filled with filtered artificial seawater (FASW) just covering the coral fragment. A gradual increase in salinity due to water evaporation results in a polyp-bail-out response, with separate polyps released from the coral skeleton. Polyp release can be expedited by gently pipetting or stirring the water around the coral fragment. Precise conditions for the different coral species used here differed as detailed in the text. A 5-mm fragment from the corals P. damicornis or S pistillata typically yields 30-40 micropropagates. Expelled micropropagates are transferred to a small Petri dish containing FASW at ambient salinity for up to 10 min for initial recovery. Micropropagates are then screened for viability using a stereo-microscope, and scored by observing tissue integrity, the extension of mesenterial filaments and the presence of vortical ciliary flows 37 . Viable polyps are collected using a clean glass pipette and used for settlement as described. Polyp-bail-out imaging ( Fig. 2b ; Supplementary Movie 1) was done using an Olympus SZX12 stereoscope (Olympus, Japan) equipped with a UI-1465LE camera (IDS Imaging Development Systems GmbH, Obersulm, Germany).",

The raceway is made of a shallow glass tray divided into three channels, each 3-cm wide and 1.5-cm deep, with a 1-cm-high downstream wall to direct overflow. All glass parts are glued together using non-toxic silicone aquarium sealant. To maintain flow, the raceway is placed on top of a small glass container (20 \u00c2 30 cm area; 10-cm deep) filled with FASW. Glass brackets placed about 3 cm below the top of the container support a 19 \u00c2 29 cm glass shelf, so that a small gap is left between the edge of the shelf and the container's short sides. The total operating volume is B3.5 l. A 20 W submersible aquarium pump (Aqua Medic GMBH) placed inside the glass container drives constant flow through a silicone tube coming out of the gap on one end of the glass shelf and divided between the raceway channels. The system is placed at a slight angle so that water coming out of the raceway channels return to the main container through the gap on the downstream end, thus allowing continuous recycling of the water. Water temperature is maintained using a self-regulated 25 W submersible aquarium heater (Aqua Medic) and an aquarium thermometer is used to visually verify temperature. Salinity is controlled by daily addition of distilled water to compensate for evaporation. Light is provided using a mixture of white and blue LED strips, with a total photon flux of 150 mmol photons per m 2 per s (measured using a Li-Cor 189 light meter (Li-Cor, USA)) and operated on a 12-h light-dark cycle.",

A branch tip fragmented from a healthy coral colony is micropropagated via a polyp-bail-out response by subjecting it to a gradual increase in salinity. Micropropagates are transferred to open microwells within a microfluidic channel and incubated under controlled light, flow and temperature conditions to induce settlement. Microscopic observation is facilitated by sealing the microwell with a glass coverslip and introduction of flow via silicon tubes connected to a syringe pump. Light intensity is controlled using the microscope's transmitted illumination system. Temperature control may be provided using a stage incubator. The coral-ona-chip platform allows maintaining live coral micropropagates on the microscope stage for extended time periods while precisely controlling the chemical and physical environment.",

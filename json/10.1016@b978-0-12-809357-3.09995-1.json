    "abstract": "A multidisciplinary book of this nature was long overdue for teaching and research and Dr. Antony Joseph has accomplished this commendable work. Providing ample references to original work, scientists, teachers, and students from various science disciplines will find this book extremely useful and interesting. Opening up a new window on multidisciplinary research and teaching, Dr. Joseph has explored a wide range of topics, from the Earth's core and oceans' bottom, to deep inside the vast expanse of the universe. In doing so, he has critically analyzed the geological, geophysical, physical, geochemical, astronomical, astrophysical, biological, biochemical, and biomedical aspects. His vast range of interests and his excitement about the topics have made this an interesting and useful book for teaching and research. He addresses all the topics with such equal expertise that it is difficult to determine to which discipline of science he belongs. His knowledge in every sphere is profound. He has worked painstakingly for the last four years to accomplish this great feat. My admiration for this book is great and I congratulate him for writing such an urgently needed book. If your interests extend to a complex range of topics from different disciplines of science, you'll find this book particularly helpful. Dr. Antony Joseph is an eminent scientist who had a long oceanographic career associated with the CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography (CSIR-NIO), Goa, India, from February 1978 to July 31, 2012. While participating in oceanographic cruises onboard research vessels, he had opportunities to see remarkable marine creatures, examine the intricacies of the seafloor, and observe oceanographic processes, including valuable living and nonliving resources. Dr. Joseph has substantially contributed to the design and performance evaluation (both laboratory-scale and field-based) of ocean current and sea-level measuring devices. He led the establishment of an in-house designed sea-level station in Ghana, West Africa. The data measured from this station upon the arrival of the Sumatra tsunami in December 2004 contributed to understanding the global extent of this disastrous tsunami.

The origin of life is a subject matter of intensive research for biologists, anthropologists, geologists, and cosmologists. Science now has evidence about the origin of the universe and the life supported by Earth and some clue about possible life on other planets and galaxies as well. Abundant life appears to have colonized this planet approximately 3800 million years ago (ie, 3.8 billion years ago (BYA)).

Darwinian selection would have acted once self-replication of life was established and then evolution to more complicated forms of life could have taken place. Prokaryotes were the only form of life on Earth for millions of years until more complicated eukaryotic cells came into being through evolution.

It is the most primitive organism from which all organisms now living are supposed to have evolved. The LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.8-3.5 BYA. At about 3 BYA, something similar to modern photosynthesis developed and oxygen was produced. Over time, it transformed the earth's atmosphere to its current state. Some of the oxygen reacted to form ozone, which collected in a layer near the upper part of the atmosphere. By blocking the ultraviolet radiation, it allowed cells to colonize the surface of the ocean and ultimately the land.",

Homochirality is essential for the functioning of proteins as amino acid polymers, and for the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), which requires incorporation of D-sugars. Appearance of homochirality in some biomolecules can apparently force corresponding homochirality onto others. It is believed that once D-sugars appeared in RNA, L-amino acids in protein might have been automatically formed. Emergence of this homochirality is a very important question in the mechanism of origin of life. \"How did this homochirality of amino acids and sugars arise?\" has been a puzzling question for scientists working on this mystery. All life known to exist on Earth today, and all life evidenced in the geological records, seems to be based on DNA genomes and protein enzymes (with exceptions of some RNA viruses). DNA is like a blueprint of biological information needed to build and maintain the living organisms. While discussing the DNA versus RNA in terms of identifying living cells, use of a highly sensitive molecular technique specifically targeting RNA as indicator of living cells in deeply buried marine sediments has been explained.",

Strong reasons have been given to conclude that DNA and protein based life was preceded by simpler life forms based primarily on RNA, in which the genetic information was stored in the sequence of RNA molecules, and the phenotype derived from the catalytic properties of RNA. RNA was the first genetic molecule to form, providing a template to reproduce itself and make further molecules of life. Informational polymer RNA must have arisen by purely chemical means at some stage in the origin of life. The support in favor of \"RNA world\" hypothesis comes from the facts, including: (a) the central role played by different RNA molecules in the protein synthesis, (b) this process can take place in the absence of DNA, but not of RNA, and (c) the existence of replicating biological systems such as viroids and RNA viruses that use other single-or double-stranded RNA molecules to store genetic information. So, it is argued that genetic continuity was assured by the replication of RNA; and genetically encoded proteins were not involved as catalysts during the origin and evolution (development) of life on Earth. It is also interesting to view DNA as a modified RNA, because the components of DNA are synthesized from RNA components in modern biological systems. It was also assumed by the proponents of a RNA-world hypothesis that RNA-based life had been driven to extinction long ago with the arrival of superior DNA-based life.",

                "text": "According to some origin of life scientists, \"life\" may have originated when first of all RNA chains experienced the basic conditions (as conceived by Darwin) for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: (i) heritability, (ii) variation of type, and (iii) competition for limited resources. Fitness of an early RNA replicator would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities and the availability of resources. Three primary adaptive capacities could be: (1) capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (resulting in heritability and variation), (2) capacity to avoid decay, and (3) capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been encoded in their nucleotide sequences. Their relative values of adaptive capacities would have determined the competitive success among different RNA replicators. RNA/vesicle systems that contain more genetic material (due to faster RNA replication) develop more internal tension than neighboring vesicles with less RNA, and draw membrane material from them. This would have allowed natural selection of vesicles by competition and control their own growth. Thus, for the first time, a system would have undergone Darwinian \"evolution by natural selection\" acting on variation and been a new and crucial emergent property arising at the transition from non-life to life. However, a superior DNA molecule is thought to have taken over the role of data (genetic information) storage due to its increased stability, while proteins, through a greater variety of monomers (amino acids), replaced RNA's role in specialized bio-catalysis.

The central problem is to understand how a protein-free RNA world became established on the primitive Earth. It is far from obvious how ribonucleotides, building blocks of RNA, could have formed from their constituent parts (ie, ribose and nucleo-bases). The researchers have relied only on indirect hints to infer what RNA-based life was like. Some scientists believe that RNA-based life may not have been the first life to exist. It is believed that RNA may have played a major step in the evolution of cellular life, but this does not necessarily mean that first life was RNA-based. Evidence have been put forward that multiple self-replicating molecular systems preceded RNA. The main objections to the RNAworld hypothesis are: (i) RNA is too complex a molecule to have arisen prebiotically, (ii) RNA is inherently unstable, (iii) catalysis is a relatively rare property of long RNA sequences only, and (iv) the catalytic repertoire (skills) of RNA is too limited.",

Evidence for biological activity can be derived from carbon isotopes because a high C /C 13 ratio is characteristic of biogenic carbon. The microfossil record only extends to $3.5 BYA and the chemo fossil record to $3.8 BYA. Besides this, evidence of life on Earth is manifestly preserved in the rock record as well. Given the temporal limits of rock record ($4 billion years), the detrital zircons as old as 4.38 billion years have been documented. Zircons, serving as time capsules, can capture and preserve their environment. There are reports on C /C 13 of graphite preserved in 4.1 billion years old zircon grains imaged by transmission X-ray microscopy. The carbon contained in the zircon has a characteristic signature-a specific ratio of Carbon-12 to Carbon-13-that indicates the presence of photosynthetic life. Therefore, the most recent research reported in 2015 argues that the graphite's C -rich isotopic signature may be evidence for the origin of life on Earth by 4.1 BYA, based on examination of zircons discovered from Jack Hills, West Australia. The discovery indicates that life may have begun shortly after the planet formed 4.54 BYA. Some scientists believe life arose relatively quickly on Earth; then by analogy, life could be common in the whole universe. The research further suggests that life in the universe could be abundant. Simple life on Earth appears to have formed quickly, but it likely took many millions of years to evolve the ability to photosynthesize.",

Darwin propounded a plausible mechanism, natural selection, defined as the principle by which each slight variation of a trait, if useful, is preserved. According to some Darwinists, the common ancestor somehow evolved from nonliving matter, which is presumed to be some kind of dirty-water soup composition. Thus, submarine hydrothermal vents have become important to the origin of life studies. Charles Darwin showed that it is the gradualness of evolution through the natural selection process that allows formation of advanced/complicated life forms from simple ones. As for example, ancestors that look like bacteria can change into descendants that look like humans gradually over time, if given sufficient generations. As long as there is some variation between individuals and that variation is heritable, there will be an inevitable selection of individuals with most advantageous variations. If the variations are inherited, then differential reproductive success will lead to a progressive evolution of particular population of a species, and populations that evolve to be sufficiently different eventually become different species. \"Origin of Species\" was published in 1859, 23 years after Darwin returned from his long research voyage aboard the HMS Beagle. The concept was simple but powerful: individuals best adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce. Although Darwin's explanation of the causes of evolution had fallen out of favor among biologists during the first decades of the 20th century, the advent of molecular biology has advanced and accelerated the study of evolution by allowing direct examination of the genetic material that ultimately determines the phenotype (the set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment) upon which natural selection acts.",

As a prelude to explaining this relationship, he first brings into focus the great strides made in astronomy, cosmology, and the working of the universe by extraordinary thinkers and visionaries such as Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1726), Dr. Albert Einstein (1879 -1955 ), Dr. Vesto M.

According to Dr. (Fr.)

Self-organization in the origin and evolution of the universe (physical world) and life (biological world) has drawn much attention to these researchers. It is now generally accepted in scientific circles that the laws of nature are so self-sufficient that the complexity of the entire physical universe evolved from fundamental particles. Just as atoms, stars, and galaxies self-assembled out of the fundamental particles produced by the Big Bang, the laws of nature are self-sufficient enough to self-assemble life by chemical evolution of suitable molecules and structures, regardless of whether these laws are not designed or designed by God, as proposed by one school of thought. In the language of science embodied in Dr. (Fr.) Lemaitre's Big Bang theory, the universe evolved by self-organization of simple material structures towards more and more complex structures. Atoms, stars, and galaxies self-assembled out of the fundamental particles produced by the Big Bang. It has been suggested that, just like stars and their planets' satellites in the Universe-formed primarily from heavier elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen that were born in the explosions of supernovae-we, who consist primarily of these very same elements, are thus literally born from the stardust.",

It is very interesting and admirable that the satisfactory explanation offered by the Bing Bang theory of the origin of the universe, founded solely on Dr. Albert Einstein's \"General Relativity\" theory and Hubble's cosmological measurements, gave a new dimension to the discussion on the topic of a totally different subject in science, that is, biological evolution of complex life forms from simple cells. Primitive life on Earth is believed to have happened just over 3.5 to 4.0 \u00c2 10 9 years ago. Oparin in his book \"The Origin of Life,\" proposed that in prebiotic times, spontaneous generation of life would be less difficult if the ocean contained a large amount of complex organic components similar to those present in living organisms. These compounds would serve both as structural components and as the energy source for the first organisms. He also proposed that Earth had a reducing atmosphere of hydrogen (H ), ammonia (NH 3 ), methane (CH 4 ), and water (H 2 O) in its early stages, and that organic compounds might be formed under these conditions. Urey based his arguments for the reducing atmosphere on the thermodynamic properties of gases in a cosmic dust cloud from which the solar system was formed. He proposed that organic compounds might be synthesized by ultraviolet radiation and by electrical discharges (lightening) in the reducing atmosphere. Stanley Miller performed fundamental experiments using electrical discharges in a flask into which water vapor, H 2 , CH 4, and NH 3 had been injected and found that amino acids had formed, thereby strongly supporting the above theories. Since then, several other steps in the synthesis of organic molecules have been carried out and experiments simulating prebiotic conditions have yielded sugars, fatty acids, and nucleic acid bases. In continuation of these results, much research on chemical evolution and the origin of life have been carried.",

It is argued that chemical evolution was followed by biological evolution, in which proteins were formed by polymerization of amino acids, and aggregates appeared in the water medium along with other organic compounds. Then, only after the origin of the genetic code, determined by the sequence of bases in nucleic acids-the first selfreproducing molecule, self-perpetuating cells could have arisen. Thus, self-organization of life first took place at the molecular level, for example, proteins, nucleic acids (RNA and DNA). Following the evolution of the first cell on the Earth (ie, prokaryotic cells, which did not have distinct organization of nucleus), organization of nucleus took place in eukaryotic cells, which evolved from prokaryotic cells. Subsequently, from the lower forms of unicellular living organisms evolved all the higher forms of complex multi-cellular living organisms, spearheaded by modern humans. It is now a well-established fact that the genetic code has played a key role throughout the evolutionary process and acted as an intracellular computer in the organization of the cells, tissues, organs, and the whole organisms.",

Based on the latest estimates, there exist about 8.7 AE 1.3 million different species of organisms on Earth; at the cellular and molecular levels, there is a unique master plan of organization common to all. All organisms have the cells as their basic structural and functional unit and all have essentially the same genetic code made of DNA. The light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopic studies have shown that cells of a particular type are organized together to form a tissue of specialized function, and different tissues are organized to form organs to perform a particular function in an organism. There is also a definite organizational plan in our solar system and galaxy, other galaxies, and cluster of galaxies of the expanding universe as revealed by telescopic and astrophysical investigations in every band of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, little has been done to investigate a relationship between the microscopic organization of living organisms and the astronomical organization. My investigation implies that the two parts of nature-biological world down to microscopic level and physical world at macroscopic level-are intimately correlated; a fact which has always been overlooked. The investigation points out a definite correlation between the organizational plan of DNA molecule and cells during organic evolution and the organizational plan of our solar system during inorganic evolution. The following equation, showing the correlation between the genetic code of DNA molecule and the apparent motion of the Sun-due to Earth's revolution around the Sun-has been derived by me and reported: (64 \u00c0 K)/20 \u00bc 339/107.65, where 64 \u00bc number of codons; 20 \u00bc number of amino acids; K \u00bc astro-molecular constant derived in my paper; 339 \u00bc number of disks of the sun to measure its apparent path along the ecliptic in the celestial sphere between the two equinoxes; and 107.65 \u00bc average distance of the sun in terms of its own diameter from Earth.",

The above equation correlates the biological molecular data with the astronomical data, thereby implying a common organizational plan of the DNA molecule and our solar system, probably due to the influence of a common governing force, that is, gravitational force and waves. In the framework of Dr. Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, the properties of space, time, and gravitation are merged into one harmonious and elegant picture. Dr. Albert Einstein propounded the idea of gravitational curvature of the four-dimensional space-time continuum. This correlation also suggests that all natural self-assembly-from microscopic to macroscopic world (microcosm to macrocosm)-are probably influenced and controlled by gravitational curvature of space-time, as for example, self-assembly of the solar system and DNA double helical molecule. Scientists have long used mathematics to describe the physical properties of the universe. But cosmologist Max Tegmark believes that the universe itself is mathematics. In Tegmark's view, everything in the universe, humans included, is part of a mathematical structure. In his book, \"Our Mathematical Universe,\" the M.I.T. physicist Max Tegmark describes two important aspects-one is an informative survey of exciting recent developments in astrophysics and quantum theory, and the other is a discussion of his innovative idea that reality itself is a mathematical structure. DNA and life originated and evolved in the gravitational curvature of the fabric of space-time caused by the sun's large mass and Earth's mass as proposed in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. It is truly gratifying that Dr. Einstein's last prediction about gravitational waves was confirmed on February 11, 2016, a century after his prediction.",

It is tempting to speculate that there could be a correlation between the helical world line of Earth's orbital motion and the helical structure of the DNA molecule, which is the first self-reproducing double-helical molecule to have formed in the beginning of evolution of life. The large gravitational force, due to the curvature of Dr. Einstein's space-time, exerted by the sun not only holds the members of the solar system together, but also causes them to take part in its true movement, that is, a movement relative to the adjacent fixed stars and a revolution (cosmic year) about the center of the galactic system, which itself is moving in the space. It is interesting to propose that cosmic year might cause biological rhythms (cosmic rhythms) on the Earth in a large scale of time. We know that the diurnal rhythms (circadian rhythms) and annual rhythms observed in the activities, distribution and physiology of the living organisms are related to the time of the day on a 24-h basis (due to rotation of the Earth) and season of the year (due to revolution of the Earth around the sun, and the Earth's axis being tilted by 23.5 degrees with respect to the ecliptic).",

If intelligent life exists elsewhere in the cosmos, it is likely that the basic structural organization of genetic code and cell, tissue, and organ systems would be the same as on Earth because of the universal gravity acting in the cosmic fabric of space-time. Several works on supermassive star have opened up a new field in astrophysics, called relativistic astrophysics, where Newtonian gravity is replaced by Dr. Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Dr. Einstein has also suggested that gravitational fields play an essential role in the elementary formations which go to make up the atom. Different combinations of the same atoms, obeying the same laws, compose both the inanimate and the living worlds. The evidence has been presented that virtually all electrons and nuclei of the atoms, that are or have been part of living matter on Earth, come from almost all stars in our and nearby galaxies, and even from all other galaxies in the universe. Many scientists, who believe in an underlying order in nature, search for an ultimate, unifying principle in the physical sciences as well as in biological sciences.

These findings may open new vistas in our understanding of the origin, evolution, and structural organization of the universe. The advent of a new generation of astronomical instruments opens new windows for the astronomers, and may call for major revisions in the standard view of cosmology. My proposition is that an extensive and well-coordinated work between different types of microscopes and telescopes would be able to reveal more mysteries enveloping the microcosm and macrocosm; and thus further bridging the presently existing gaps between various scientific disciplines, such as biology, chemistry, and astronomy/astrophysics.

Astronomers have taken the pictures of interconnecting filaments of star clusters and clusters of galaxies that form the texture of the universe and connect our galaxy to the vast expanse of the universe. One of these filaments of groups of galaxies and star clusters surrounded by immense voids is considered to be akin to the umbilical cord that fed our galaxy during its youth. Many phenomena-involving stars, nebulae, galaxies, cluster of galaxies, and black holes-occurring in the universe, seems to be analogous to the phenomena occurring in the living system. These analogies existing on the two different scales of space and time might appear unrelated initially. DNA, the blueprint of all living organisms on the earth, is involved in the structural organizations and all vital functions, such as protein synthesis and production of energy.

Aging first-generation stars then expelled them out into space. The forces of gravity subsequently allowed for the formation of newer stars and of planets. The formation of the solar system began approximately 4.6 BYA with the collapse of a small part of a giant nebula. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the sun, while the rest flattened into a proto-planetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small solar system bodies formed. The surface of a fire ball of hot gases consisting of rock vapor clouds (Proto-Earth) started cooling since its birth. The Proto-Earth collided with a Mars-sized projectile some time before 4.5 BYA. Vaporized rock, mainly from the projectile, condensed in orbit to form the moon. The rock vapor clouds of the Proto-Earth radiated heat to space, thereby cooling the planet to liquid rock in approximately years. Thus, the early Earth was fully molten. Further cooling resulted in its present form of a flattened sphere called Earth. Water clouds condensed at the top of atmosphere and heat radiated to space. From 4 to 3.8 BYA, Earth underwent a heavy bombardment by asteroids. Steam escaped from the crust while more gases were released by volcanoes. Clouds formed as the planet cooled. Rain gave rise to the oceans about 3.8 BYA, or even earlier. Carbon dioxide (CO ) being a greenhouse gas, Earth's surface could not have cooled to habitable conditions without the sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 as carbonates in hot rocks.

Geologists derive some idea from these rocks about the composition of the interior of the Earth. Another source of information is earthquake, or seismic waves which is more indirect, but perhaps more important. When an earthquake occurs anywhere on Earth, seismic waves travel outward from the earthquake's epicenter. The speed, motion, and direction of seismic waves changes dramatically at different levels within Earth, known as seismic transition zones. Therefore, scientists can make various inferences about the Earth's character above and below these transition zones through careful analysis of seismic data. The present Earth is endowed with a thin surface layer of rock called the crust that covers the globe, whose 70% area lies below the oceans.",

Large amounts of methane gas in the form of gas hydrate are trapped below the seafloor at different regions at different depths. Hydrates are unstable and tend to dissociate rapidly due to the presence of a large empty cavity at the core of their structure. Gas hydrates are clathrate compounds. Clathrate is a structure in which water molecules, under certain conditions, bond to form complex networks of molecules forming cagelike structures that encapsulate a guest molecule, which is a gas. When that guest is a methane molecule, it forms a methane hydrate. Methane hydrate deposits in the seafloor sediment layer and their role in the Bermuda Triangle imbroglio is discussed, as well as the possible influence of the warm Gulf Stream in triggering methane gas emission, which, based on scientific evidences, is suspected to be the culprit in the sudden disappearances of ships and low-flying aircrafts in the Bermuda Triangle region, earning it the nickname \"The Devil's Triangle.\"",

Significant efforts were undertaken to isolate these bioactive secondary metabolites from marine flora and fauna. Cyanobacteria, fungi, sponges, algae, and tunicates have proven to be a source of a large array of alkaloids, many of which can potentially compete with anti-cancer alkaloids derived from plants, and which are in clinical trials or in clinical use. Although the majority of these secondary alkaloids were identified in cyanobacteria, the most studied ones are from sponges and tunicates. It was found that alkaloids derived from sponges and tunicates have various anti-cancer activities. Two alkaloids derived from tunicates-aplidin and trabectedin-are already in phase II cancer clinical trials. Several modes of action of marinederived alkaloids are similar to those of their terrestrial counterparts, while others have completely novel mechanisms. Despite the recent advances in drug discovery from marine organisms, the marine environment is still to be considered a relatively untapped resource, particularly for discovering promising anti-cancer drugs. The marine organisms, which have had to endure predation and stressful habitats over prolonged years of evolution, hold great promise for the future of anti-cancer drug discovery. Successful collaborations between academic institutes and pharmaceutical companies will continue to provide the mutual benefits that each party seeks.

Such compounds are potentially therapeutic against diseases including cancer; and several clinical trials have shown encouraging results. During the preparation of immuno-conjugates by chemical synthesis, the choice of the hinge component joining the two building blocks is of paramount importance: the conjugate must remain stable in vivo, but must afford efficient release of the toxic moiety (ie, an anticancer drug molecule) when the target is reached. There are many strategies employed in developing immunoconjugates focusing on the evolution of chemical linkers. Three components are essential-a targeting agent, a biodegradable linkage, and a bioactive potent anti-cancer agent. Several aspects of the rational design of active conjugates may be of interest. Antibodies alone have shown some success in extending the lives of cancer patients, but in many cases, more potent agents are required to attempt complete eradication of the cancer mass. Many different agents have been conjugated, including traditional anticancer agents, cytotoxic natural products, phytotoxins, radioisotopes, bioactive proteins, enzymes that activate pro-drugs of cytotoxic agents, and photosensitizers. In order to exploit the maximal effect, the inherent potency of the released drug must be sufficient to kill the tumor cell, even at low concentrations. To achieve significant cytotoxicity, very potent agents must be used. Antibody-based therapeutics is of growing significance in cancer therapy, as evidenced by the fact that 28 such drugs have now been approved for oncologic indications by the FDA, for marketing in the United States. The market for these therapeutics is the fastest growing sector in the pharmaceutical industry. Thus, the pipeline of promising marine-derived or inspired agents is very strong. Seven agents have entered the clinic as approved drugs, mostly in the area of cancer, but also for viral, pain and hyperlipidemia indications. When combined with the rich pipeline of agents in clinical trial and preclinical evaluation, it can be surmised that the marine environment has performed extremely well in yielding new medicines, as well as pharmacological tools. Keeping in view the actual or suspected metabolic source of the most important agents, the heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria are the real metabolic jewels of the world's oceans; accounting for fully 80% of these clinical trials and approved pharmaceutical agents. A number of commercial providers offer marine natural products for sale as research biochemicals.

Many sessile invertebrates such as sponges, corals, and tunicates feed by filtering seawater. Because seawater contains high concentrations of bacteria, these organisms produce antibiotics to defend themselves from potentially harmful microorganisms. Thus, the production of antibacterial compounds by microorganisms and filter-feeders such as sponges, mollusks, bryozoans, ascidians, etc. provides a possible link between chemical defense for the marine organisms and antibiotics for use in humans.

This discovery led researchers to synthesize analogues, Ara-A and Ara-C, which improve antiviral activity. These marinerelated compounds are in clinical use. Ara-A is the acronym for Adenine arabinoside. This is an analogue of adenine and acts by inhibiting DNA polymerase, so that viral DNA synthesis is inhibited. It is effective against herpes viruses, varicella-zoster virus, vaccinia, and hepatitis B viruses. Arabinosyl Cytosine (Ara-C) is a chemotherapy agent used mainly in the treatment of cancers of white blood cells, such as acute myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Ara-C kills cancer cells by interfering with DNA synthesis. Ara-C and Ara-A were the first commercialized drugs of marine origin. Some other early successes were the discovery of prostaglandins and cephalosporins, and production of a cervical dilator from seaweed of the Laminaria genus. Systematic efforts and leads for drug development were greatly helped by the development of new technologies in diving, sample collection, chemical analysis, and biological screening. It is worth noting that more than 7000 marine natural products have been isolated and many leads have been obtained which have resulted into some drugs being commercialized, either as semi-synthetic derivatives of the original marine chemicals, or completely new synthetic compounds. Analysis of the source of these natural products indicate that approximately 25% are from algae; 33% from sponges; 18% from sea whips, sea fans, and soft corals; and 24% from other invertebrate phyla such as tunicates, mollusks, starfish, sea cucumbers, and moss animals.",

The species most commonly recommended for use as a nutritional supplement are Spirulina maxima and Spirulina platensis. These occur naturally in warm, alkaline, salty, brackish lakes, but are also commonly grown by aquaculture and harvested for commercial use. Spirulina is one of the best sources of concentrated protein (containing 83-95% digestible protein), all 10 essential dietary amino acids to gain muscle, a good source of vitamin B12 useful for neurological functions, high natural concentration of beta-carotene, and mixed carotenoids to boost immune system, full spectrum of antioxidants, high concentration of phycocyanin to boost immune stimulating biliprotein, highest natural form of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA; an essential fatty acid) whose concentration is next to only mother's milk, rhamnose (a rare biologically active sugar), glycogen, omega-3, and other essential fatty acids. The GLA present in the spirulina species can be used in the body to form products that are anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative. It is potentially useful for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and diabetic neuropathy. It may also play a role in lowering plasma triglycerides and increasing HDL cholesterol. Spirulina also contains elements such as iron, calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium, selenium, and zinc. It is also a good source of trace minerals, some vitamins, bioflavonoids, and other phytochemicals. It has an exceptionally high level of an anti-oxidant (superoxide dismutase). Spirulina is often added to green juices, smoothies, and health shakes to bump up protein and antioxidant content. It is also used as a feed supplement in the aquaculture, aquarium, and poultry industries. Spirulina has been used as a source of protein and nutrients, particularly beta-carotene, by the World Health Organization (WHO) to feed malnourished children. Moreover, the GLA present in spirulina dissolves fat deposits, helps prevent heart problems and reduces \"bad\" cholesterol. According to the findings of the National Cancer Institute, USA, sulfo-lipids in spirulina are remarkably active against the AIDS virus. Regular intake of spirulina increases anti-viral activity, stimulates the immune system, reduces kidney toxicity, improves wound healing, and reduces radiation sickness.",

Interestingly, fishes do not produce omega-3-fatty acids, but accumulate them by eating micro-algae or preying on fishes that have accumulated omega-3-fatty acids along with high levels of antioxidants, such as iodide and selenium from micro-algae. Antioxidants are a group of organic or inorganic substances capable of preventing the genotoxic and carcinogenic effects of free-radical compounds. Antioxidants bind to and neutralize free radicals, thereby transforming them into nontoxic compounds and blocking their genotoxic (causing damage to DNA) and carcinogenic (causing cancer) effects. Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil are useful for treating hyper-tri-glyceridemia, and thus beneficial for preventing heart diseases. Omega-3 is also useful in other clinical situations such as depression, anxiety, cancer, and macular degeneration. Nutraceuticals are currently receiving recognition for being beneficial in coronary heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, and other chronic and degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Evidence indicates that the mechanistic actions of natural compounds involve a wide array of biological processes; including activation of antioxidant defenses, signal transduction pathways, cell survival-associated gene expression, cell proliferation and differentiation, and preservation of mitochondrial integrity. It is believed that these properties play a crucial role in the protection against the pathologies of numerous age-related or chronic diseases.",

Some bioluminescent life forms (eg, anglerfish, squid, crustaceans, jellyfish, single-celled algae, to name a few) make their own light and carry it around in their bodies. In glowing animals, chemical compounds in their bodies mix together, and generate a fascinating glow in a lightproducing reaction. Bioluminescence seems to be one of the most spectacular adaptive convergences, as it is supposed to have appeared more than 40 times in evolution.

The luciferin-luciferase reaction can also create byproducts, such as oxy-luciferin and water. Luciferin and luciferase are generic terms rather than the names of particular chemicals. Lots of different substances can act like luciferins and luciferases, depending on the species of the bioluminescent life-form. For example, the luciferin coelenterazine is common in marine bioluminescence. Dinoflagellates that obtain food through photosynthesis use a luciferin that resembles chlorophyll. Their luminescence is brighter after very sunny days. Some shrimp and fish appear to manufacture their luciferin from their food. Two types of chemical pathways have been shown to allow light emission in living organisms. In the first one, called luciferin-luciferase system, a substrate (luciferin) is oxidized by an enzyme (luciferase), in the presence of oxygen and sometimes cofactors. In the second one, the luciferin, the enzymatic complex and the oxygen are bound together in a \"precharged\" compound, photo-protein. Luciferase is an enzyme that is required to speed up (catalyze) the oxidation of luciferin. The photogenic cells (photocytes), where bio-luminescence is generated internally from a chemical reaction, are often embedded in organs called photophores. Although luciferases are genome products (ie, each of them is species-specific), luciferins seem to be more ubiquitous. The same luciferin can be used as the substrate of the reaction in nonsister taxa, such as crustaceans and fishes. Tens of luminous systems have been discovered, involving various combinations of luciferins, enzymes, and cofactors and it is likely that many more remain to be discovered.",

In some parts of the ocean, these animals, not the sun, are the primary source of light. Not all animals produce their own light. Animals can either house the luminous substances in their own bodies or develop a symbiotic relationship with light-producing bacteria. Some squids and fishes adopt the symbiotic system as an efficient way to emit light, as they do not produce light, but cultivate luminous bacteria in a particular organ (light organ) in the host organism's body. The bacteria produce light all the time, so in order to turn their lights on and off, some animals can pull their light organs into their bodies.

Underwater studies on ostracods (species of small marine crustacean) abundant in coastal and deep waters have shown that males of the Vargula group use light displays to identify themselves to willing females for a whirlwind courtship. Male ostracods squirt out a bioluminescent mixture into the water. They do this about an hour after sunset over shallow sea-grass beds with the intention of attracting females. Among ostracods of different varieties, a particularly important variety among them is Cypridina. At night, the ostracod swims along and, upon encountering a predator, ejects luciferin and luciferase into the water, producing a cloud of blue luminescence. The animal then swims away into the darkness of the surrounding water. The luminescence is emitted by an enzyme reaction, commonly known as the luciferinluciferase reaction. When cypridina is dried, the specimen keeps its luminescence property almost permanently, and it will emit light again by simply wetting it with water. Because of this property, the Japanese military collected a large quantity of this organism during World War II for intended use as a low-intensity light source.",

There was a puzzling question of why was blue light emitted in the extraction while the intact organism glowed in green? Finally the studies revealed that the blue light coming from aequorin was only the source of energy for another gleaming protein-the jellyfish green fluorescent protein. It was also revealed that the light emitted by aequorin was absorbed by the green fluorescent protein, which used this energy to produce a green fluorescence. Hence, it became known as the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The structure of the GFP chromophore was elucidated and verified later by scientists. The cDNA of GFP from the beautiful jellyfish Aequorea was cloned and expressed in living organisms. The successful expression of GFP has established the basis for using GFP as a marker protein for gene expression, resulting in the present widespread popularity of GFP. The usefulness of GFP has been further enhanced by the discovery of red-fluorescent GFP-like proteins in anthozoan corals, and also by various improvements and developments. Scientists are very happy and hopeful for the growing usefulness of GFP as one of the most important tools used in contemporary bioscience. The GFP is composed of 238 amino acids, linked together in a long chain. This chain folds up into the shape of a beer can. Inside this \"beer can\" structure, amino acids glow green when exposed to ultraviolet light. It is now used as a marker on otherwise invisible proteins within cells to trace them as they take part in different cellular functions. It can tag individual cells in tissue. And it can also show when and where particular genes turn on and off. The GFP contain a special chromo-phore that sucks up the energy and then emits the energy without any additional chemicals to illuminate it. This aspect of GFP separates it from other bioluminescent proteins. By introducing the GFP gene into E. coli and C. elegans, it was shown that there were no other jellyfish-specific proteins or factors necessary to produce the green glow, thereby removing the initial doubts that GFP would not work outside jellyfishes.",

It is known that tens of thousands of different proteins reside in a living organism, controlling important chemical processes in minute detail. If this protein machinery malfunctions, illness and disease often follow. That is why it has been imperative for bioscience to map the role of different proteins in the body. By using DNA technology, researchers can now connect GFP to other interesting, but otherwise invisible, proteins. This glowing marker allows them to watch the movements, positions, and interactions of the tagged proteins. GFP enables a visual fix on how organs function, the spread of disease and the response of infected cells to treatment. This glowing protein is used as a tag to illuminate previously invisible biochemical processes deep within cells and the development of nerve cells in the brain, or how cancer cells spread through tissue. GFP allows following the fate of various cells: such as nerve cell damage during Alzheimer's disease or how insulin-producing beta cells are created in the pancreas of a growing embryo. They are now even incorporated into bacteria to act as environmental biosensors in the presence of toxic materials. GFP was used to identify various biological phenomena in the earthworm-a creature frequently studied because of its genetic similarity to humans. By modification of just a few amino acids in the chromophore, the GFP was able to absorb and emit different colors in the color spectrum, such as cyan, blue, and yellow. Later DsRed (red fluorescing protein) was used as a fluorescent tag which is one of the easiest fluorescent colors to observe and now used to identify many of the illness-and disease-producing proteins. By doing structural research on GFP, scientists developed further fluorescent derivatives and variants, such as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), and blue fluorescent protein (BFP). This allowed researchers to give various proteins and cells different colors. This enables scientists to follow several different biological processes at the same time.

The study of marine phytoplankton has always been a subject close to the hearts of marine biologists. The secrets of phytoplankton have often been perplexing to oceanographers. A team of scientists participating in the NASA-sponsored oceanographic expeditions and punching through 3-ft thick sea ice in the Arctic Ocean waters, made a biological discovery in Arctic Ocean waters, which were found richer in phytoplankton than any other ocean region on Earth. The finding reveals a new consequence of the Arctic's warming climate and its ecology. Scientists now consider that the thinning Arctic ice is allowing sunlight to reach the waters under the sea ice, catalyzing the plant blooms where they had never been observed. The impacts of El Ni\u00f1owarming and La Ni\u00f1a-cooling events on the chlorophyll levels and plant life in the oceans have also been discussed by the author.",

                "text": "The mammalian baroreflex is a fast beat-to beat mechanism that maintains short term cardiovascular homeostasis. It consists of input to the central nervous system from peripherally located baroreceptors and efferent pathways to both the heart and the vasculature. It is symmetric in its response in that it responds to both an increase and a decrease in blood pressure and adjusts heart rate, stroke volume and vascular resistance accordingly. Very little information exists on the fish baroreceptor reflex, especially in polar living species. In the present study the cardiac limb of the barostatic reflex was studied in the Antarctic fish Pagothenia borchgrevinki using a traditional pharmacological protocol (closed loop experiment) in combination with ventral aortic occlusions and blood volume changes. Phenylephrine (aadrenoceptor antagonist) and angiotensin both caused a significant increase in blood pressure and a reflex reduction in heart rate that could be blocked by atropine. Sodium nitroprusside (nitric oxide donor, up to 100 Ag kg \u00c0 1 ) had no effect on blood pressure in this species and could therefore not be used to study the effect of blood pressure drop on heart rate. Instead, blood volume changes and ventral aortic occlusions were used. The barostatic gain factor, was similar for volume induced changes and pharmacologically induced pressure increases. When blood pressure was lowered a reflex mediated increase in heart rate was seen with a similar gain factor indicating a symmetrical baroreceptor reflex. These data will be discussed in relation to findings in other studied teleost species.",

                "text": "The tonic contraction of the venous blood vessels, venous tone, is a determining parameter for venous return and cardiac filling. Thus, contraction of central veins can augment cardiac filling and increases stroke volume. In the present study, we investigated venous tone in three groups of anaesthetised reptiles, snakes (Crotalus durissus), turtles (Trachemys scripta) and crocodiles (Caiman latirostris) from measurements of mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP) . MCFP is the central venous pressure (CVP) measured during mechanical occlusion of the arterial outflows from the heart, and reflects vascular tone and blood volume. MCFP was markedly higher in Crotalus compared to Caiman and Trachemys, whereas CVP were rather similar between the three species. Stroke volume and MCFP in all three species were very sensitive to reductions in blood volume, but stroke volume did not increase markedly when blood volume was increased by infusion of blood. The adrenergic regulation of the venous system was studied by infusion of adrenaline and the aand h-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine and isoproterenol. Adrenaline and phenylephrine caused large increases in MCFP, whereas MCFP decreased in response to isoproterenol. Thus, in all species a-adrenergic stimulation causes venous contraction and h-adrenergic stimulation causes venous relaxation. It is clear that regulation of venous tone has the potential to regulate cardiac filling in the all major groups of reptiles.

Melzner, C. Bock, M. Langenbuch and H.O. P\u00f6 rtner, (Alfred-Wegener-Institute, Bremerhaven, Germany, fmelzner@ awi-bremerhaven.de) Laboratory raised Sepia officinalis (Cephalopoda) were capable of extracting 70 -90% of available oxygen from the ventilatory current within the natural thermal window of the population (11 -17 -C), which represents the highest rates of extraction recorded for a cephalopod thus far. Low ventilation volumes of less than 40% body weight min \u00c0 1 result. In combination with low ventilation pressures of < 0.025 kPa, ventilatory power output and ventilatory costs are minute. Less than 2% of cuttlefish total power is consumed by ventilatory mechanics. Both the mode of venous return and blood oxygen binding characteristics sustain an efficient ventilatory system: Cephalic vein blood flow towards the gills is tightly coupled to ventilation pressure in the mantle cavity, with vein flow pulses being elicited at the maximum mantle cavity pressure increase of each ventilatory pressure cycle. Additionally, in vivo venous blood oxygen partial pressures are lower than previously reported, ranging from 1 -1.5 kPa. Highest pH sensitivity of the cuttlefish hemocyanin consequently was found at much lower oxygen partial pressures (1 -2 kPa) than in squid species (Loligo Illex), which display low oxygen extraction rates from the ventilatory current (of less than 15%), and can thus afford to maintain higher venous oxygen partial pressures. The merits of the cuttlefish ventilatory system clearly lie in minimizing water flow and energy demand, thereby sustaining the energy conserving mode of life of a sit-and-wait predator and supporting camouflage strategies in their highly uniform muddy bottom habitat.

                "text": "The lungs of vertebrates have undergone a marked evolutionary change from a relatively simple structure in amphibians to being highly complex in endothermic mammals and birds. High structural complexity of the lungs allows for smaller gas exchange units and increased surface area, which increases the diffusive capacity for O 2 , but may also render the lungs more prone to local mismatching of perfusion and ventilation. Thus, it is likely that local control of blood flow through vasoactive substances and neuronal regulation has become increasingly important in the transition from structurally simple to complex lungs. The structural and functional diversity of the lungs amongst reptiles offer an interesting opportunity for studies on the evolution of local regulation of the pulmonary circulation. In the present study, we have characterised the effects of hypoxia, various regulatory peptides, nitric oxide in selected species of reptiles. There is a clear tendency towards stronger hypoxic vasoconstriction in reptiles with structurally complex lungs such as varanids and caimans. However, the NO tone, revealed via blockade of nitric oxide synthase with l-NAME and infusion of the NO donor SNP, seems to correlate with low pulmonary blood pressures. In pulmonary circulation of turtles and pythons, we find no effect of endothelin-1. Likewise, there are only very small or no effects of various regulatory peptides, such as bradykinin, neuropeptide gamma and neurotensin on the pulmonary circulation, while the systemic circulation exhibit brisk responses.",

Abele, (Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany, ephilipp@ awi-bremerhaven.de) A tendency for higher maximum life span (MLSP) of cold adapted marine ectotherms was found, when comparing related species with similar lifestyle from permanently cold and temperate waters. We are interested in the physiological principles underlying differences of MLSP in marine ectotherms, especially with respect to the effect of temperature and lifestyle on metabolic rates and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. We investigated basic metabolic, antioxidative defence and oxidative damage parameters in different aged individuals of two burrowing mud clams, the Antarctic Laternula elliptica (MLSP\u00a836 years) and the temperate Mya arenaria (MLSP\u00a813 years), and two swimming scallops, the Antarctic Adamussium colbecki (MLSP\u00a845 years) and the temperate Aequipecten opercularis (MLSP\u00a88 -10 years). Of the mud clams, the longer-lived Antarctic species had lower standard metabolic rates and mitochondrial H O 2 generation, resulting in slower decrement of mitochondrial functions and conservation of tissue redox state with age. In the scallop group, a less pronounced decrease in mitochondrial and antioxidant enzyme activities in the Antarctic scallop might account for the higher MLSP. Despite a lower MLSP and the active lifestyle, mitochondria of the temperate scallop exhibit slower senescence than temperate mud clam mitochondria, indicating lifetime energy allocation adjusted to conserve optimal physiological functioning until a threshold is reached where physiological maintenance requires more energy than justified by the reproductive gain.

Stevenson and Ian G. van Tets Arvicoline rodents (lemmings and voles) are important in northern temperate and arctic ecosystems because of their strong influence on predator populations, plant communities, and soil nutrient loads. Their population numbers can vary heavily from year to year, often following cyclical patterns. Some arvicolines, such as the northern redbacked vole (Clethrionomys rutilus), do not hibernate and have been known to breed during winter. It is unclear how they do this while undergoing periods of decreased energy availability and increased relative metabolic and thermoregulatory demands. The capacity to winter-breed may be tied to the mechanisms leading to population cycling in arvicolines. However, preliminary research suggests that free-living C. rutilus contain very low levels of body fat in all seasons. We test the hypothesis that C. rutilus is constrained by low, year-round lipid stores and follows an income-breeding strategy in which the energy it invests into reproduction stems directly from increased dietary/energy intake. We test this hypothesis by using dual-energy Xray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure seasonal changes in the body condition of C. rutilus in southcentral Alaska. We describe our methods of proximate analysis for the validation of the Lunar Piximus2 DXA apparatus on this species and discuss other recent applications of DXA to wildlife physiology and ecology. Seasonal DXA analysis provides the necessary information for determining the breeding and foraging strategies of Alaskan redbacked voles. This information is important to improve the current understanding of how voles fuel reproduction during different seasons and will provide insight into knowing how climate change might affect the reproductive and foraging strategies of small mammals in arctic and sub-arctic regions.",

Xylose is not known to be efficiently utilized by mammals. It is however utilized by certain bacteria, yeasts and fungi, particularly gastrointestinal bacteria, which yield end products that are utilized by the host in oxidative metabolism. We investigated the contribution of intestinal bacteria of A. namaquensis to xylose metabolism. Mice were caught during Protea humiflora flowering and non-flowering seasons and given an oral dose of 14 C-labelled xylose. Exhaled CO 2 and excreted urine and faeces were continuously collected for 30 hours after dosing and radioactivity of the samples determined. Each mouse was then treated with antibiotics to eliminate gut microflora and the experiment was repeated. With their natural gut flora population intact, mice caught during the flowering season exhaled significantly more 14 CO 2 than mice caught during the non-flowering season. Also, during both the flowering and non-flowering seasons, mice exhaled significantly more 14 CO 2 before antibiotic treatment than after. After antibiotic treatment significantly more C-labelled xylose was excreted in the urine. These results provide further evidence that diet influences the composition of the gastrointestinal community, and that A. namaquensis relies on its gut microflora to ferment xylose and produce end products that are used by the mice for metabolism. Following these experiments caecal bacteria were isolated from mice, cultured anaerobically and assayed for xylose utilization using C-labelled xylose. Positive xylose utilizers were identified using 16S rRNA-based taxonomy.

Before this interruption, chicks undergo extremely rapid statural and ponderal growth. Aiming at extending the comprehension of form and function in bone tissues, we recorded experimentally (by means of fluorescent labelling) the growth rate of bone tissue in 4 long bones (humerus, radius, femur, tibiotarsus) of 4 King Penguin chicks, during their first month after hatching. Moreover, we assessed the associated bone microstructure, in order to test a relationship between growth rate and bone tissue type. We found the highest bone tissue growth rate known to date, up to 171 microns/day. Moreover, there was a significant effect of bone tissue type on growth rate (0.0001 < P < 0.02, depending on the long bone). Most notably, highest rates were obtained with a special micro-architecture of fibro-lamellar bone, where cavities in the woven network are aligned radially. We discuss the heuristic value of the relationship between bone tissue type and growth rate, and the biomechanical counterparts of accelerated bone growth.

Laberge and P.J. Walsh, (University of Miami, RSMAS, USA, tlaberge@rsmas.miami.edu, pwalsh@rsmas.miami.edu) Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) is responsible for the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine/ammonia, bicarbonate and ATP. There are three different isoforms of CPS that play a vital role in urea biosynthesis, via the ornithine -urea cycle (O -UC), and in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Gene duplication has been proposed in the evolution of this gene family with CPS II likely giving rise to CPS I/III but where CPS I separated from CPS III is still undetermined. The question of the origin of tetrapods has stimulated scientists_ interests since it was first proposed that tetrapods likely arose from lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii). Earlier enzymatic studies characterized aestivating lungfish Protopterus aethiopicus and Protopterus annectens as having CPS I-like activity and Latimeria chalumnae as having CPS III-like activity. This suggested that the division between CPS I and CPS III may have occurred before the division of the lungfish. A recent study on urea synthesis in Protopterus dolloi has shown CPS III-like activity in the liver which further refines the split of CPS I and CPS III within the lungfish clade. There are many CPS sequences available in Genbank. These sequences were used to design isoform specific primers for CPS. The focus of this project uses RT-PCR and sequencing of the CPS isoforms in lungfish and other fishes to try to evaluate where the ancestral split between CPS I and CPS III occurred and to determine the types of CPS genes that are associated with specific vertebrate species. Keywords: Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, Evolution Recent evidence indicates that toadfish with circulating cortisol levels elevated by exposure to crowding stress have increased mRNA expression of tUT, an unusual, pulsatile, urea transporter (tUT) present in the toadfish gill. This urea transporter allows the toadfish the excrete urea in distinct 0.5-3 h pulses, once or twice a day. On a molecular and pharmacological level tUT is similar to UT-A facilitated diffusion urea transporters found in the mammalian kidney, however, the regulatory factors behind the pulsatility of tUT are still under investigation. Sharp, periodic declines of plasma cortisol levels appear to play a permissive role in the activation of tUT as the pulsatile excretion of urea is consistently preceded by a decline in circulating cortisol. However, lowered cortisol concentrations do not always result in a urea pulse. In addition, fish loaded with cortisol by arterial infusion have elevated mRNA expression of tUT yet experience a reduction in the size of a urea pulse with no effect on pulse frequency, suggesting that periodic activation of the transporter requires an additional stimulus. Recent work on the regulation of tUT has turned to the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin), as arterial injection of this monoamine causes physiologically sized pulses in approximately 50% of the fish injected. The injection of 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists affect pulatile urea excretion, suggesting that these receptors play a role in the regulation of tUT. The interaction between cortisol, 5-HT and 5-HT 2 receptors in the regulation of tUT will be discussed. Keywords: Urea transporter, tUT, Cortisol, Serotonin, Stress",

Exposure to 3.5 mM ammonium chloride for 16 and 40 h resulted in a parallel increase in brain ammonia (3 fold) and brain glutamine (2 fold) and a decrease in brain glutamate (1.3 fold), both of which were prevented in fish pre-treated with methionine sulfoximine (MSO), an irreversible inhibitor of glutamine synthetase. Ammonia exposure also induced an increase in plasma osmolality (by 7%) which was probably due to a disturbance of osmoregulatory processes but which did not result in broader whole body dehydration as indicated by muscle water analysis. The increase in brain glutamine was not associated with any changes in brain water unlike mammals which show symptoms of brain swelling and increased intracranial pressure. Toadfish pre-treated with MSO did not survive a normally sublethal exposure to 3.5 mM ammonia for 40 h unlike mammals where MSO is protective of ammonia exposure. Both the lack of brain water accumulation and the lack of a protective effect of MSO in toadfish imply that mechanisms of ammonia toxicity in toadfish appear to be via pathways other than cerebral swelling. Furthermore, the enhancement of ammonia toxicity by MSO suggests that glutamine synthetase function is critical to ammonia tolerance in this species.

Bury a , ( a King's College London, Department of Life Sciences, Franklin-Wilkins Building, London, UK; b University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, Miami, USA, christopher.2.cooper@kcl. ac.uk, nic.bury@kcl.ac.uk, mgrosell@rsmas.miami.edu) In the marine teleost intestine the secretion of bicarbonate increases pH of the lumen (pH 8.4 -9.0) and importantly reduces Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ concentrations by the formation of insoluble divalent ion carbonates. This could potentially also cause essential metal carbonate formation reducing bioavailability. Non-haem bound Fe is taken up in the mildy acidic mammalian duodenum in the ferrous state (Fe 2+ ) by an epithelial proton symporter Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT1). Iron accumulation was assessed in the Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) by mounting intestine segments in modified Ussing chambers fitted to a pH-stat system. The pH stat system allows the mucosal pH to be clamped (pH 5.5 or 7.0), enabling investigations into the influence of proton concentrations on iron uptake, and redox state to be altered (gassing with N , addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) and ascorbate), to compare Fe 3+ versus Fe 2+ uptake. Altering lumen pH (5.5 or 7.0) had no effect on transepithelial potential, bicarbonate excretion, or mucus and epithelium iron (Fe 3+ or Fe 2+ ) absorption. None of the redox altering strategies affected iron (Fe 3+ or Fe 2+ ) binding to mucus, but the addition of ascorbate resulted in a far greater uptake of iron. These results show that the mucus layer covering the epithelia is important in capturing iron independent of the redox state, iron is preferentially taken up across the epithelia in the ferrous (Fe 2+ ) state, but unlike the mammalian system this is not enhanced at low pH, and the rate limiting step appears to be ferric reduction at the outer membrane.

Measurements of Na + , Cl \u00c0 , Ca 2+ , ammonia and urea flux rates show that Pb has no effect on Na + homeostasis, stimulates Cl \u00c0 uptake, and inhibits Ca 2+ uptake. Soft tissue Ca 2+ concentrations are also reduced upon exposure to Pb, while Na + and Cl \u00c0 concentrations are unchanged. Finally, hemolymph pH is significantly increased upon exposure to Pb. A physiological model of snail ionoregulation and shell formation has been developed to explain these observations. We hypothesize that inhibition of Ca 2+ uptake results in reduced CaCO precipitation used for shell formation. The result is increased extracellular HCO 3 \u00c0 which in turn is compensated for by increased HCO 3 \u00c0 extrusion through a Cl \u00c0 /HCO 3 \u00c0 exchanger, explaining the observed increased Cl \u00c0 uptake.

These responses are difficult to quantify and there is a need for novel, non-invasive digital tracking techniques. A newly developed camera-interfaced software system (FishTraXw) was used to characterize the locomotor activity response of groups of zebrafish larvae (N = 4; 2 replicates) (Danio rerio), to sub-lethal ethanol treatments. Both chronic (3 -5 dpf) (0%, 0.5%; 1% and 1.5% (v/v)), and acute (8 min) (0%, 1%, 2% and 3% (v/v)) responses to ethanol were characterized. It was found that for 3 dpf and 5 dpf chronically exposed larvae, there was an inverse relationship between locomotor activity and ethanol concentration (df = 4; P < 0.05), with higher concentrations producing greater hypoactivity. However at 4 dpf chronic exposure to all ethanol solutions produced significant hyperactivity (df = 4; P < 0.05). The system enables the non-invasive tracking and recording of similar sized conspecifics in response to stimuli and is viable even for very small animals (< 3 mm). The merits and limitations of the system are discussed in relation to other non-invasive fish tracking systems, as well as its potential uses in behavioural and ecotoxicological studies.

As many fish, especially nocturnal species, it should rely on chemosensory mechanisms for food search and ingestion. The aim of this study* was to test whether chemical substances from a natural prey, the polychaete Diopatra neapolitana, are detected by olfaction and affect the behaviour of S. senegalensis. A macerate of polychaetes was separated by solid phase extraction (SPE), using reverse phase C18 cartridges, into hydrophobic (eluate) and hydrophilic compounds (filtrate). The olfactory sensitivity to the macerate, eluate and filtrate was assessed using the electro-olfactogram (EOG). The effect of the polychaetes' macerate and SPE fractions on the swimming behaviour of single sole specimens was studied in a flow through aquarium, using a video tracking system. The polychaetes' macerate and the filtrate evoked similar EOG amplitudes in concentration -response studies, whereas the eluate did not evoke significant EOG responses. Both the macerate and the filtrate increased the swimming activity of sole specimens; this effect was not observed when the fish were stimulated with the eluate. The results suggest that hydrophilic odorants from polychaetes induce food search behaviour in the Senegalese sole. The chemical identification of the active substances is currently under investigation. Further research will assess whether odorants from natural preys increase the ingestion of commercial food pellets.

                "text": "Studies of prey detection by olfaction in teleost fishes have focused largely on amino acids as odorants while studies with respect to nitrogenous waste are few by comparison. Although threshold sensitivities for amino acids are often in the nano-molar range, gill and renal membranes are thought to be less permeable to amino acids than lower molecular weight compounds such as ammonia or urea. Furthermore, amino acids are generally conserved for protein synthesis and are a minor constituent of excreta. In this study, we compare the detection of ammonia, urea, and amino acids by Lutjanus griseus (gray snapper). Opsanus beta is a preferred prey item of L. griseus. O. beta is unique among teleosts in that adults can facultatively shift between ammonia and urea excretion while urea excretion is pulsatile. We hypothesized that pulsatile urea excretion may be related to predator chemoreception. Experiments were conducted in 8000 l outdoor mesocosms with flow-through seawater and a sediment/seagrass substrate to simulate natural habitat. Odorants were injected into small experimental shelters designed to mimic toadfish burrows. Shelters were equipped with low-light video cameras to remotely monitor snapper behaviors. Preliminary results indicate that L. griseus are more responsive to ammonia than either urea or an ammonia/urea mix with threshold sensitivities below 5 uM. Additionally, L. griseus are more responsive to an amino acid/ammonia mix than either an amino acid/urea mix or amino acids without waste-N. The discussion is framed in the context of the adaptive significance of facultative ureotely in the toadfish. Keywords: Toadfish, Predation, Ureotely, Chemoreception, Ammonia In the breeding season, male Salaria pavo (marine) and S. fluviatilis (freshwater) develop an androgen-dependent anal gland from the first two rays of the anal fin, which is the source of a putative pheromone that attracts ovulated females to the male's nesting site. The chemical nature of this pheromone is, as yet, unknown. The current study* therefore investigated the olfactory potency of chromatographic fractions of anal gland secretions using olfactory epithelial field potential measurement (electroolfactogram) in female S. pavo. The stimuli used were: i) solid-phase extracts of anal gland macerates, and macerated anal fin rays, of both species, ii) solidphase extracts of water conditioned by males of both species before, and after, anal gland removal and iii) HPLC fractions (reverse-phase C-18, using HPLC grade water and HPLC grade methanol as mobile phase) of solid-phase extracts of water conditioned by male S. pavo before, and after, anal gland removal. The largest olfactory responses were evoked by: i) anal gland macerate of both species; ii) solid-phase extracts of water conditioned by males of both species before, but not after, anal gland removal; iii) the first three 5-minute HPLC fractions of solidphase extracts of water conditioned by S. pavo males before, but not after, anal gland removal. These results suggest that the putative pheromone is similar in chemical nature in both species, is multi-component, and consists of relatively water-soluble substances. The chemical identities of the active substances are currently under investigation.

This study particularly focused on the ability of sea-bass to maintain their hydro-mineral balance in freshwater and on their ion (re)absorbing abilities at gill and kidney levels. Two different responses were recorded during the freshwater exposure. 1. Successfully adapted sea-bass displayed standard behavior over several months; their blood osmolality was maintained almost constant during freshwater exposure, attesting their efficient hyper-osmoregulation. Their branchial and renal Na + /K + -ATPase abundance and activity was high thanks to a high number of branchial ionocytes and to a well-developed urinary system involved in active ion reabsorption resulting in the production of hypotonic urine. 2. Sea-bass unsuccessfully adapted to freshwater were recognized by abnormal schooling behavior. Their blood osmolality was low, a sign of acute osmoregulatory failure. High branchial Na + /K + -ATPase abundance and activity were coupled to a proliferation of gill ionocytes, whose ultrastructure did not display pathological signs. In their urinary system, the enzyme abundance and activity were low which was related to the lower observed density of kidney tubules. Urine was isotonic to blood, which ruled out any participation of the kidney in hyperosmoregulation. The kidney failure seems to generate a compensatory ion absorption through increased gill activity. But net ion loss through urine seems higher than ion absorption by the gills, leading to lower hyperosmoregulatory performance and to death.

                "text": "Intestinal water absorption is critical for salt and water balance in marine teleost fish. Diffusive fluid loss to the hypertonic seawater is offset by continuous drinking and intestinal Na + and Cl \u00c0 absorption provides the osmotic force for intestinal fluid absorption. Traditionally, salt absorption was attributed to Na:Cl and Na:K:2Cl cotransporters in the apical membrane of the marine teleost intestine and epithelial water absorption, in general, is assumed to be isotonic transport. However, a novel aspect of intestinal Cl \u00c0 absorption has recently been identified and can account for as much as 70% of the total net Cl \u00c0 absorption. This substantial contribution to Cl \u00c0 absorption is driven by apical Cl \u00c0 /HCO 3 \u00c0 exchange and can account for fluid absorption even in absence of Na + . Unlike other water absorbing epithelia, the marine teleost intestine absorbs a hypertonic solution which apparently is highly acidic. The Cl \u00c0 and fluid absorption is clearly associated with substantial Na + recycling across the basolateral membrane. In the gulf toadfish, the secondary active transport of Cl \u00c0 and HCO 3 \u00c0 by the apical anion exchanger rely on basolateral Na + /H + exchange and is thus driven by the Na/ K-ATPase. The cellular substrate for the apical anion exchange is HCO 3 \u00c0 arising from carbonic anhydrase mediated hydration of endogenous CO 2 . Thus, considering the intracellular environment, an osmotically inert gas is exchanged for an osmolyte (Cl \u00c0 ) providing osmotic force for water absorption. The continuous absorption of acidic fluids is compensated for by dynamically regulated branchial acid extrusion maintaining acid -base balance despite varying and high rates of intestinal base secretion.

Meischke and G. Cramb, (St Andrews, Ljm19@st-and.ac.uk) Few vertebrates can rival the bull shark when considering salinity tolerance. It is able to survive in water ranging from 0 to 53 ppt by precisely controlling the composition of their body fluids. This requires the expression, function and coordination of several ion transporters and channels including the Na, K-ATPase. In this study, juvenile bull sharks were acclimated to either freshwater (0 ppt) or seawater (35 ppt). Following the amplification, cloning and sequencing of isoforms of the bull shark Na, K-ATPase alpha and beta subunits, nucleic acid probes were constructed for use in Northern blot analyses to quantify messenger RNA expression in the osmoregulatory tissues, the gill, rectal gland, kidney and intestine. Using antibodies raised to the known sequences of both subunits, protein expression of Na, K-ATPase alpha and beta subunits have been compared in the gill, kidney and intestine of both FW-and SW-acclimated sharks. Keywords: Osmoregulation, Elasmobranch, Rectal gland, Euryhaline The neurohypophysial peptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) has been linked with the osmoregulatory physiology of teleost fish, though precise actions remain unclear. AVT has been implicated as having a role in water conservation and/or ion elimination and has been shown to have an antidiuretic action in the in situ perfused trout kidney (Amer and Brown, 1995) . The current study has localised the vasotocin receptor within specific regions of the flounder kidney by means of immunocytochemistry and immunogold labelling techniques. This study represents the first exploitation of a specific affinity purified antibody raised against a short peptide sequence of the flounder V 1 receptor. Specific V 1 receptor staining was detected within the glomeruli, particularly associated with the endothelial surface of the efferent arteriole. Immunoreactivity was also observed in small vessels surrounding the collecting duct system. The presence of V 1 receptors in these regions is consistent with the proposed vasoconstrictive action of vasotocin to reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urine flow. The European eel, Anguilla anguilla, has a complex life-cycle involving migrations between the Sargasso Sea and the river systems of Europe. The requirement to move across large salinity gradients during migrations presents a significant physiological challenge and the developmental stages of the eel are closely linked to the movement between fresh and saltwater.

Differential expression of mRNA in control and freshwater-incubated cells was analysed using a combined method of differential display RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR) and random arbitrarily primed PCR (RAP-PCR). The amplified cDNA products were resolved on polyacrylamide gels and subsequently stained with silver nitrate.

Several other cDNA sequences were found homolog to full length cDNA of unknown function from Danio rerio and Tetraodon nigroviridis or could be aligned to salmonid EST library clones.

Regulation of branchial V-H + -ATPase, Na + /K + -ATPase and NHE2 in response to acid and base infusions in the Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). The effects of seawater (SW) acclimation and cortisol on the renal expression of three aquaporin water channels (AQP1, AQP1dup and AQP3e) were investigated in both silver and yellow life stages of the European eel Anguilla anguilla. AQP1dup is the most highly expressed aquaporin isoform in the eel kidney followed by AQPe and then AQP1. SW-acclimation significantly reduced the abundance of AQP1, AQP1dup and AQPe transcripts in the kidney of yellow eels. Changes in mRNA expression following freshwater (FW)/SW transfer were confined to yellow eels. In both FW-and SW-acclimated silver eels, expression levels for AQP1, AQP1dup and AQPe were equivalent to those observed in yellow SWacclimated fish. Using an eel-specific AQP1 antibody, strong specific immunofluorescence was detected mainly within (i) the vascular endothelium in yellow eels and (ii) the epithelial apical brush border in some renal tubules in silver eels. Infusion of cortisol into FW eels had no effect on AQPe mRNA expression but induced significant decreases in AQP1 and AQP1dup mRNA levels in the kidney of yellow eels. Cortisol infusion had no effect on the expression of any AQP isoform in the silver eels. These results suggest that SW-acclimation or cortisol infusion induces a down-regulation of renal aquaporin expression in yellow eels. However, the lower levels of AQP expression found within the silver eel kidney were not further reduced by salinity transfer or steroid infusion. These differences in mRNA expression were accompanied by changes in the cellular distribution of the AQP1 isoform between vascular endothelial and tubular epithelial cells. We examined whether a remarkable occurrence-the physiological evolution of two Drosophila melanogaster populations despite spatial separation of only 100 -400 m was idiosyncratic and temporary, or persisted over multiple years. We ascertained the high temperature tolerance of Drosophila descended from populations on the north-facing slope (NFS) and south-facing slope (SFS) of FCanyon_ (Lower Nahal Oren, Mt. Carmel, Israel) that were collected in 1997, 1999, and 2000. Results for these Drosophila uniformly resembled other studies' in many respects: an inverse relationship between survival and heat-shock temperature, male -female differences in thermotolerance, and inducible thermotolerance. Importantly, for all years of collection, SFS flies consistently exceeded NFS flies in basal and inducible thermotolerance after diverse heat shocks, with and without thermal pretreatment, and whether isofemale lines, synthetic populations, or inbred lines were compared. Inbred lines, however, had lower thermotolerance than outbred lines. Several non-exclusive processes may explain the evolution of such physiological differentiation. Keywords: Drosophila, Basal thermotolerance, Inducible thermotolerance, Heat shock Cyanobacteria are prevalent in the freshwater environment and can reach abundant mass in harmful algal blooms (HAB's). These blooms are common in aquatic environments with high nutrient influx and slow moving warm water. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS's) are components of the cell walls of all Gram-negative bacteria and related Cyanobacteria. Often referred to as bacterial ''endotoxin'' or pyrogens, they have been recognized as the causative agent of sepsis and ''toxic shock'' associated with bacterial infection, and have recently received attention related to the environment in association with HAB's. Recently, Best, et al. described the effect of cyanobacterial LPS's on the inhibition of glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. GST is an important detoxifying enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of reduced glutathione to many potentially toxic compounds, including metals. Additionally, GST activity is normally increased after metal insult, and has been indicated as a first line of defense against Cd 2+ toxicity before upregulation of metallothionein synthesis occurs 2 . The concurrent exposure of aquatic fauna to both LPS and metal is significant since both are present in many aquatic environments, such as The Florida Everglades, Big Cypress National Preserve, and the Louisiana Delta region. We investigated the combined effect of cyanobacterial LPS extracts and CdCl 2 exposure in zebrafish embryos to delineate a possible mechanism of decreased metal tolerance in fish.

Farrell, (Zoology Department, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, farrellt@interchange. ubc.ca) Following seasonal and reproductive cues, as well as experimental anemia, rainbow trout undergo cardiac remodeling and increase relative ventricular mass (rVM). Here, anemia (Hct\u00a810%) was experimentally induced with phenylhydrazine hydrochloride injections to quantify the time course, degree and type of myocardial remodeling, as well as the effect on cardiac output ( Q). A significant increase in rVM occurred after just 2 weeks of anemia and ventricles were 84% larger after 8 weeks. After 4 weeks of anemia, both the inner spongy myocardium and outer compact myocardium increased significantly, but the compact myocardium accounted for a disproportionate 75% of the increase in rVM, suggesting a compensatory benefit of an enlarged coronary circulation. The coronary vascular volume in control and hypertrophied (4 weeks anemia) ventricles was quantified with the radioisotope tracer technetium \u00c0 99 m. Coronary angiogenesis was suggested because hypertrophied hearts that were 34% larger had a total vascular volume of 92.0 AL gVM \u00c0 1 that was twice that of control hearts (46.1 AL gVM \u00c0 1 ). Thus, coronary angiogenesis more than compensated for the 75% increase in compact myocardium that accompanied anemia. Routine Q increased significantly with anemia but only as hematocrit reached ; 10%. We propose that the cardiac remodeling could be in response to increased Q or a hypoxic state that exists with anemia. Nevertheless, the remodeling is a transient process because following a 4-week recovery to normal hematocrit (30%), rVM and % compact decreased, though still elevated compared to control fish. The Senegalese sole is a nocturnal, benthic flat-fish of high commercial importance. As many fish, especially nocturnal species, rely heavily on chemosensory mechanisms for food detection and location, the central aim of this study was to identify substances, principally amino acids, released by natural food that act as olfactory cues. To this end, we integrated electrophysiological recording with chemical identification techniques. Olfactory sensitivity to natural food organisms was assessed using the electro-olfactogram. The most potent stimulus was the homogenate of Diopatra Neapolitana (marine polychaete). This was separated by solid phase extraction, using reverse phase C18 cartridges, into hydrophobic (eluate) and hydrophilic compounds (filtrate). These were then further separated according to molecular size (cut-off 10 kDa). Only the filtrate, containing molecules of less than 10 kDa, had any olfactory potency. This was further fractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography using water as the mobile phase. Only the first fraction (0 -4 minutes), where relatively water soluble compounds like amino acids would be expected to elute, evoked any olfactory response. The most abundant amino acids in this fraction, identified by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, were glycine and l-glutamic acid. However, a large unidentified peak was also present. It is known that glycine is a potent olfactory stimulus in this species but l-glutamic acid is not; the potency of the unidentified peak is unknown. Further work is required to evaluate how far amino acids can account for the total potency of the raw stimulus, and the identity and importance of the unidentified peak.

Casas, (University of Tours, France, Sylvain.Pincebourde@univ-tours.fr) Physiology of ectothermic organisms depends on microclimate temperature. In some insect -plant relationships (e.g. galling insect, leaf rollers, leaf miners), herbivores manipulate physically and/or chemically their proximate environment, i.e. plant tissues. However, little is known about the effects of this manipulation on the insect microclimate. We studied the thermal environment of a leaf mining insect. The apple tentiform leafminer modifies both morphology and physiology of attacked apple leaf tissues to construct a mine inside which the entire larval development occurs. We employed a mechanistic biophysical budget to predict the temperature inside a mine from climatic and physical parameters related to the insect-induced modifications of plant tissues. We showed that the activity of a larva leads to altered absorbance properties and stomatal behaviour in mine tissues. These biophysical modifications cause the thermal environment of the mine to be decoupled from the leaf microclimate. For example, at high radiation level and air temperature 25 -C, mine temperature is up to 10 -C above air temperature and about 5 -C warmer than leaf tissues adjacent to the mine. Moreover, our results reveal the existence of feedback loops between abiotic factors (i.e. climatic variables) and biotic components (i.e. plant tissues around the insect): the leaf miner controls its physical environment by manipulating its biotic environment. The resulting warm microclimate allows the larva to develop faster, which can be interpreted as a strategy to lower the risk to be attacked by a parasitoid.

Although the prey is often captured as soon as it reached the bottom of the trap, more involved attack behaviours are sometimes necessary to get the prey. They involve a cost for the antlion in terms of energy. We propose here a 3d geometrical analysis of the traps surface in order to explain the occurrence of these attack behaviours. We measured three geometrical variables: the slope angle, the difference with a perfect conical surface (named conicity) and the distance between the antlion head and the bottom of the trap (named off-centring). Off-centring is negatively correlated with the slope angle and positively correlated with the trap conicity. This off-centring is interpreted as a post-building mistake caused by antlion movements involving one or more avalanches. They make the trap less steep and less conical. In addition, the number of attacks increases with off-centring. Offcentring thus involves a loss of trap efficiency. Without offcentring, the slope corresponds to maximal predation efficiency and is lower than the angle of repose of sand (variation of 4.5-). For a given diameter, the angle of repose requires from the antlion to dig more deeply. Antlions do not dig that deeply, because reaching the angle of repose does not bring anything more in term predation efficiency, but implies extra-costs. The definition of an optimal animal construction such as a trap is discussed in light of these results.

Gerdes, Y. Cai, H. Solo-Gabriele and M. Grosell, (University of Miami, USA, rgerdes@rsmas.miami.edu) Chromated copper arsenate (CCA) is a preservative that has been used extensively to pressure-treat wood for the construction of outdoor structures such as telephone poles, decks, playground equipment, and docks. The CCA prevents settling of marine organisms on and in the wood and extends the useful life of wood structures in water. However, leaching of arsenic, chromium and copper from treated wood poses possible environmental and human health risks. This study examines the toxicity of these metals on juvenile Fundulus heteroclitus in a flowthrough system for seven days. Because leaching rates and metal toxicity are influenced by salinity, tests are being conducted in freshwater, seawater and at an intermediate salinity. The euryhaline killifish are being exposed to leachates from mixing chambers containing different amounts of well-characterized CCA-treated wood and receiving a constant water flow, resulting in mixed exposures to copper, arsenic and chromium at different concentrations. Water samples are being taken at 1, 3 and 7 days for determination of metal concentrations. At the conclusion of the experiment, mortality, whole-animal metal concentrations as well as whole-animal Na + , K + and Ca 2+ are being determined. Arsenic speciation is being measured in both water samples and fish because different species of arsenic exhibit different levels of toxicity. By comparing the toxicity observed during this mixed exposure to that reported for individual metals we hope to determine which metals are most important in exerting toxicity during exposure to this mixture.

Syakirah, F.B. Eddy and G.A. Codd, (University Of Dundee, s.samsudin@dundee.ac.uk) Blooming Microcystis spp. may produce numerous cyanobacterial toxins such as microcystins. These hepatotoxins frequently cause acute toxicoses, with damage to both the structure and function of liver. Fish kills sometimes associated with cyanobacterial blooms although mortalities are not clearly attributable to the cyanobacteria or their known toxins. Compound(s) other than microcystins may be responsible for the acute stress response. This study investigated the effects of hepatotoxins on zebrafish embryos, to determine the active compounds. There was no effect on embryo development after 3 days of exposure to crude cells extracts (5 and 50Ag/l microcystin-LR equivalents) (MCLR strain PCC 7813). However 500 Ag/l MCLR equivalents caused pronounced oedema, curl tail and curvature. Exposure to extracts of crude cells in 30 to 70% methanol fractionations also produced these effects, with these concentrations being ideal for MCLR extraction. The 100% methanol fraction also produced these effects despite MCLR being absent, indicating the presence of other as yet unidentified bioactive compounds. Unique observations of this study are Fblunt face_ and novel body distortions due to heat treatment and acid/alkali extraction of selected fractions. It is suspected that MCLR and other heat or pH stable compound(s) caused these effects, or worked synergistically or antagonistically with other bioactive compounds. Crude cell extracts containing high concentrations of MCLR also caused increased larval width, weight and yolk sac volume. It was concluded that the developmental, morphological and cardiovascular effects observed were due to the MCLR treatments, and that these treatments formed possible relationships with as yet unidentified bioactive compounds.

A cineradiographic analysis has shown that the furculae of birds undergo extraordinary deformations during the wingbeat cycle. Cyclical deformations are known to produce microfractures into the bone tissue, which may be a stimulus for Haversian remodelling, a mechanism of destruction and reconstruction of bone tissue that may repair bone microdamage. We have tested the effect of the frequency of cyclical deformations on the rate of Haversian remodelling in the furculae of birds. After controlling for the effect of size, we have found, by using phylogenetically independent contrasts, that all four clades showing high frequency flapping flight have higher rates of Haversian remodelling than the corresponding sister clades showing other kinds of flight of lower wingbeat frequency. Therefore, we conclude that high wingbeat frequency is a stimulus for Haversian remodelling, mediated by bone microdamage. Other factors such as the shared aquatic habitat and the adaptations to diving or plunging may also underlie the presence of extensive Haversian remodelling in species of Alcidae, Podicipedidae, Anatinae and Rallidae.

                "text": "The bicolor damselfish, Stegastes partitus, is a common species of fish on Florida coral reefs. These fish can be afflicted with a disease known as Damselfish Neurofibromatosis (DNF). DNF is caused by a virus-like agent, termed the damselfish virus-like agent (DVLA) that can induce the formation of tumors of the peripheral nervous system. The goal of this research is to understand where DVLA replicates and how DVLA causes cellular transformation. Initial studies have focused on viral replication using established healthy and tumored cell cultures in our laboratory. Experiments involving the chemical manipulation of cell cultures infected with DVLA were conducted in order to monitor the effect of these chemicals on viral DNA patterns. Initial results showed that DVLA DNA and RNA are susceptible to ethidium bromide and DVLA transcription is inhibited by AZT. Interestingly, DVLA is not affected by aphidicolin which directly inhibits nuclear DNA polymerase. These results suggest that DVLA replication is not dependent upon nuclear DNA polymerase and therefore, the nucleus may not be the site of DVLA replication. Experiments are underway to quantify mitochondrial, nuclear and DVLA DNA levels in cells treated with these various chemical agents using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). The chemical manipulation of cell cultures in combination with QPCR will allow for the comparison of DVLA copy number to nuclear and mitochondrial gene specific copy numbers which could help specify where DVLA is replicating.

                "text": "In the hypo-osmotic environments of freshwater fish, active uptake of Na + and Cl \u00c0 through the gills is important to counterbalance the continuous diffusive ion loss. As seen in many fish species, gills are crucial for ion transport and acid -base balance. Bicarbonate transporters are essential for cell pH regulation, which is achieved via homeostatic control of intracellular ions. Two major gene families encode Cl \u00c0 /HCO 3 \u00c0 exchangers. First, the SLC4 anion exchangers (AE family), which includes sodium-bicarbonate cotransporters and Na + -driven Cl \u00c0 / Base exchangers. Second, the SLC26 family is a multigene family of tissue-specific transmembrane exchangers that are involved in the transport of many different anions with variable specificity. This variability in anion specificity, in addition to tissue expression patterns, governs the physiological role of each paralog. In mammals, examples of such physiological roles include transepithelial Na + -Cl \u00c0 transport, bicarbonate excretion by the distal nephron and bicarbonate secretion by the exocrine pancreas (Mount and Romero 2003). Many homologs of SLC26 genes have been identified in bacteria, plants, fungi, as well as many different animals (Cherest et al. 1997 , Saier et al. 1999 , Hawkesford 2003 . In a recent study on Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis sabina) a pendrin(SLC26A4)-like exchanger was detected in V-H-ATPase-rich cells in the gill epithelium (Piermarini et al. 2002) . Several members of the SLC26 family have been isolated from zebrafish gill and kidney. The expression and functional profiles of the identified genes will aid in implicating them in Cl \u00c0 uptake and pH regulation in zebrafish.

                "text": "In freshwater teleosts, the primary mechanism of acute silver toxicity is inhibition of Na + /K + ATPase at the gill, leading to net Na + and Cl \u00c0 loss due to the continued diffusion of these ions into the hypo-osmotic external environment. External Cl \u00c0 has been shown to protect some fish such as Oncorhychus mykiss, against silver toxicity presumably by the complexation of silver ions to form AgCl. However, there are important exceptions in that the same AgCl complex formation does not appear to influence silver sensitivity in other fish such as Anguilla anguilla and Pimephales promelas. We hypothesize that differences in the protective effects of Cl \u00c0 at the gill may be due to differing requirements for Cl \u00c0 uptake and/or different Cl \u00c0 transport mechanisms among fish species. Fish, which are not dependent on Cl \u00c0 uptake at the gill, perhaps obtaining chloride requirements through the diet, may not be sensitive to inhibition of active chloride uptake at the gill, which is associated with acute silver toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we will expose Danio rerio, which rely on Cl \u00c0 uptake across the gills, Fundulus heteroclitis, which is known to not take up Cl \u00c0 from freshwater, and P. promelas, in which Cl \u00c0 uptake has yet to be measured, to silver in soft water with varying additions of Cl \u00c0 . We hypothesize that the sensitivity of these three species to silver in environments of changing external Cl \u00c0 concentration will correspond to their rate of Cl \u00c0 uptake at the gill rather than to chemical silver speciation. Salinity changes associated with the movement of fish between freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) environments induces variable osmotic stresses in all euryhaline teleost species. The aim of this sudy was to improve our understanding of the physiological adaptations induced within the osmoregulatory tissues of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) following transfer from FW to SW. Various tissues were sampled from FW/FW and FW/SW transferred fish at different intervals over a 4 month period. Plasma concentrations of cortisol, angiotensin II, chloride, potassium and sodium were measured as was the plasma osmolality. RNA was isolated from brain, gill, kidney and intestine. The enrichment of differentially expressed genes in each of the four tissue libraries was achieved by Suppression Subtractive Hybridisation (SSH). A representative number of clones from each library were randomly selected, PCR amplified and spotted onto glass slides. To estimate the quality of the libraries a number of clones from each were sequenced. The analysis of sequences showed 27%, 21%, 11% and 6% of redundancy for brain, intestine, gill and kidney libraries respectively. To date 36%, 34%, 57% and 71% of the sequences for intestine, brain, gill and kidney libraries respectively are not represented in available databases. The microarrays were screened with appropriate targets and analysed to identify the differentially expressed genes at each time point in each tissue.

Eggs from a fast-growing broiler chicken strain were incubated in normoxia (21% O 2 ) and chronic hypoxia (14% O 2 ) and sampled on day 15 and 19 of incubation. No differences in B max were found between treatments on day 15, but on day 19 hearts from hypoxic embryos had lower h-adrenoreceptor density than normoxic embryos (5.0 T 2.1 vs. 8.1 T 2.7 fmol Ag protein \u00c0 1 ). Hypoxia did not modify receptor affinity at any developmental stage but affinity was lowered on day 19 as seen by the increased K d values (0.07 T 0.02 vs. 0.19 T 0.06 in normoxic 15d and 19d embryos respectively). This suggests that h-adrenoreceptor density is not affected by hypoxia until late gestation in broiler chickens and that receptor affinity is not affected by hypoxia, but is lowered with incubation time.

Therefore, there is a need for accurate and sensitive assays to quantify this toxin in water and tissue samples. A nodularin-based indirect competitive ELISA has been developed to increase the sensitivity of the assay with a lower minimum detection limit for nodularin in mussel tissue as compared to the microcystin-based protocol. It also yields a direct quantification of nodularin, compared to the commercial kits where it has to be expressed as MC equivalents.

                "text": "During the past few years its immersed area has been gradually reduced due to effluent discharges and siltation. The major contaminants in the lagoon are derived from a multitude of nonpoint sources associated with urbanization and industrial activities within the watershed. Heavy metals are probably a class of pollutants contributing to the observed decline of fish species. The metal content in the water and sediments in the lagoon were investigated as well as gill metal bioaccumulation and gill histopathological changes of the grey leaping mullet, Mugil saliens. The extent of total metal contamination in the water was low, the metals in the particulate matter being the largest contribution. The estimated mean concentrations of each metal, in the sediment, that fish in the lagoon may have been exposed to, were 234 mg Zn/kg d.w. and 84 mg Cu/kg d.w. These values are below sediment quality guidelines. The gills are the first organ to contact the contaminated sediment particles, so that they became a significant accumulation tissue as seen by the metal-bioaccumulation factors (BFA), Zn-BFA, 49% and Cu-BFA, 10%. The fish captured, with 6 to 12 years old, showed a significant increase in Cu-and Zn-(BFA), with fish age. Gill histopathological changes observed in epithelial tissue included edema, lifting of lamellar epithelium, severe vasodilatation, aneurisms, proliferation of filamentar epithelium and lamellar fusion suggesting chronic effects of metal exposure. The fish gill is a multi task organ that carries out the functions such as respiration, ion regulation, acid -base balancing and disposing nitrogenous by products. With area of more than 50% of the whole fish body, the fish gill is the most important part that affects by the toxins inside the water since it has very little immunity except of the operculum. This organ responds rapidly to various stimuli and is prone to chemical and physical damages. Therefore, when the gills expose to environmental pollutants for a long time they will experience various damages and complications. These tissue complications made the fish susceptible to secondary diseases and potential mortalities. In this series of studies the gill tissue abnormalities had been studied in three important Caspian Sea fishes including Acipenser Stellatus Acipencer Percicus, and Rtilus Frisi Kutum. The gill specimens were H and E stained after fixation and preparing the tissue section in common methods. Hyperplasia is the most common feature in all three species. In fact, these conditions are general response against pollutants, parasites, suspending particles or Ammonia or any other stimulus for adaptation or protection. Hyperplasia is an unusual multiplication of gill epithelium cells affecting the gas exchange and respiration and in more intense cases could merge the neighboring blades and hamper the gas exchange. According to our studies and some other researches, gill hyperplasia could be considered as an ecotoxicological indicator for fishes. Keywords: Gill, Hyperplasia, Caspian Sea, Pollution Incubation of trout hepatocytes with copper (Cu) stimulates the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), disrupts Ca 2+ homeostasis and ultimately causes cell death (Manzl et al, 2004) . The present study examined the role of mitochondria in this scenario, the potential involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and the mode of cell death induced by the metal. Two h of exposure to 10 AM Cu caused a significant increase of both apoptotic and necrotic cells. Addition of the iron-chelator deferoxamin to Cutreated hepatocytes significantly attenuated Cu-stimulated ROS production and completely prevented cell death. The origin of the radicals generated was at least partly mitochondrial, as it could be inhibited by myxothiazol, an inhibitor of complex III of the electron transport chain, and as it could be directly localized to the mitochondria by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In a subpopulation of cells, Cu caused a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and induced the MPT. Cyclosporin A, which did not diminish ROS formation, prevented the onset of the MPT and inhibited apoptotic, but not necrotic cell death. Cu-induced apoptosis therefore appears to be dependent on induction of the MPT, but the prominent contribution of mitochondria to ROS generation also suggests an important role of mitochondria in necrotic cell death.

Pelster, (Innsbruck, Austria, Gerhard.Krumschnabel@uibk.ac.at) Calcium ionophores such as ionomycin are often used to determine the role of intracellular Ca 2+ in cellular regulation, however, studies concerning the effect of ionomycin on intracellular pH are contradictory (Cabado et al, 2000) . In this study, the effect of 0.5 AM ionomycin on the changes in intracellular pH (pHi) and acid secretion of trout hepatocytes was examined in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca 2+ (Ca 2+ e), BAPTA-AM (intracellular Ca 2+ chelator) and cariporide (specific inhibitor for Na + /H +exchanger NHE1). Also the effect of ionomycin on the intracellular free Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ i]) in the presence and absence of both Ca 2+ e and cariporide was investigated. pHi and [Ca 2+ i] were measured using the fluorescent probes BCPCF-AM and Fura 2-AM, respectively, acid secretion was measured with a cytosensor microphysiometer. According to our data, exposing the cells to ionomycin induces an increase of pHi which appeared to be due to Ca 2+ release from intracellular stores as well as Ca 2+ entry from extracellular space. This increase in pHi was not due to activation of cell membrane NHE1, since acid secretion did not show any change on exposing the cells to ionomycin. Nevertheless, exposing the cells to cariporide delayed the ionomycin-induced increase of both [Ca 2+ i] and pHi. Altogether, these data indicate significant interaction between pHi and calcium homeostasis in trout hepatocytes.

During hyposmotic exposure, the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK) was significantly increased within 2 min and reached a maximum after 30 min of incubation. Activation was seen independently from serum starvation status and inhibition of phosphatases. No significant changes in ERK1/2 activation were observed in hyperosmotic saline. In order to get insight into the pathways leading to ERK 1/2 activation, cells were exposed to agents known to interfere with several signalling proteins. Inhibition of PI3K pathway, elevation of cellular cAMP level, and exposure to a purinoceptor antagonist had no effect on the hyposmotic p-ERK response. Chelating extracellular Ca 2+ reduced iso-and abolished hyposmotic ERK1/2 activation. PKC inhibition with chelerytrine or staurosporine stimulated ERK1/2 phosporylation under iso-and further enhanced it under hyposmotic conditions, whereas PKC stimulation with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate had no significant effect on p-ERK levels. Immunocytochemical localisation of ERK1/2 indicated accumulation of the active form on organelles and at the perinuclear region, but we could not detect nuclear accumulation of the protein. In summary our results suggest an involvement of PKC and Ca 2+ in the osmotically induced activation of ERK1/2.

Krumschnabel, (Innsbruck, Austria, Gerhard.Krumschnabel@uibk.ac.at) Exposure to metal cations like Cu, Cd and Cr(VI) elicits a number of physiological and metabolic toxic effects at the cellular level. In this study, isolated common carp hepatocytes were used as a model system to elucidate, in a comparative fashion, the short term (3 -6 h) and long term (24 h) cytotoxic potential of these metals at a concentration of 10 AM. Cell viability, as measured from LDHleakage from damaged cells, showed a significant decrease with Cu during 3 h, while Cd and Cr(VI) left viability unaltered. Cytosolic free calcium levels (Ca 2+ i) were significantly elevated after a delay of 10 min with Cu, whereas only a slight and a transient rise in Ca 2+ i was seen with Cd and Cr(VI), respectively. Production of reactive oxygen species was significantly increased with Cu only. Similarly, lipid peroxidation was stimulated with Cu, but was also enhanced with Cd after 6 h. Evaluation of toxic effects on actin and tubulin cytoskeleton elements after 24 h of exposure exhibited a pronounced disruption of F-actin along with membrane surface blebbing with all three metals. The effect of the metals on tubulin structure was less pronounced. Overall, it appears that, for isolated carp hepatocytes, Cu is acutely the most toxic of the three metals tested, but Cd and Cr(VI) also damaged cells upon prolonged exposure.

Pelster, (Innsbruck, Austria, Claudia.Manzl@uibk.ac.at) In this study the influence of swim training on the expression of two important factors involved in angiogenesis was investigated in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Larval zebrafish of two different developmental stages, ''swim-up'' larvae (9 days post fertilisation, dpf) and ''free-swimming'' larvae (21 dpf), were exposed to a continuous training of 18 hr/d while control animals were kept in stagnant water. Applying in situ hybridisation method, expression of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin (EPO) in control and trained fish was detected using specific digoxigenin-labelled RNA-probes. Basal mRNA levels of VEGF and EPO were detected in fish from all groups in virtually all organs, i.e. brain, eye, gill, kidney, liver, intestine, and muscle. In ''swim up'' larvae training induced enhanced expression of VEGF and EPO in the gills, but no clear-cut increase was observed in muscle tissue. In comparison, in ''free-swimming'' larvae the expression of VEGF and EPO mRNA appeared to be stronger in muscle tissue of the trained fish, but was unaffected in the gills. These results demonstrate a correlation between training and an upregulation of VEGF and EPO mRNA expression in zebrafish, with tissue-specific response patterns at different developmental stages. Furthermore, these data suggest that an increase in VEGF expression is involved in the previously observed improvement of the capillarization in muscle tissue of trained fish (Pelster et al., Am J Physiol 285: R339 -R347, 2003).

The objective of this study was to determine the time course effects of acute exposure using sub 96 h LC50 concentrations of Cd on ion regulation and gill histopathology. Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, were reared in freshwater and exposed to 5, 15 and 25 mg/L of CdCl 2 during 96 h. As indicators of ionoregulatory disturbance we measured plasma Na + and Ca 2+ concentrations as well as muscle water content. As the gill is the dominant ionoregulatory organ, and Na + /K + -ATPase an important driving force in active transepithelial ion transport, we measured branchial (activity and protein level) expression of this ATPase in crude gill homogenates and quantified the distribution of Na + /K + -ATPase immunoreactive cells by immunohistochemistry. Histopathological alterations of the gill were analyzed by light microscopy. Plasma Na + concentrations were unaffected and plasma Ca 2+ values only decreased after 96 h exposure in a dose independent manner. Branchial Na + /K + -ATPase activity and a subunit protein level expression were not affected by Cd exposure during this period. Branchial chloride cell numbers, identified as Na + /K + -ATPase immunoreactive cells, decreased 24 h after exposure but recovered thereafter. Some non-specific alterations in gill morphology were observed, including interstitial oedema, lamellar epithelium lifting and fusion of lamellae as a result of filament epithelium proliferation. Lamellar aneurisms, probably induced by the loss of pillar cell support capacity, and necrosis in filament epithelium were also seen. Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, of both sexes were exposed to 40 and 400 Ag L \u00c0 1 of waterborne copper. Gill and blood samples were collected before exposure to copper and after 3, 7, 14 and 21 days of exposure. Gill copper concentration and Na + /K + -ATPase activity were determined in branchial tissue. Osmolality, ions concentrations (Na + and Cl \u00c0 ), proteins, glucose and cortisol were determined in plasma samples. Gill copper deposition increased linearly with exposure time and concentration and showed a significant negative correlation with gill Na + /K + -ATPase activity. Plasma Na + and Cl \u00c0 values decreased with increasing copper concentration and evidenced a slightly higher correlation coefficient with gill copper deposition than with gill Na + /K + -ATPase activity. Plasma osmolality decreased significantly with copper exposition in the highest concentration tested when compared to control levels. However, at the lowest concentration this effect was only observed in long-term exposure. Plasma proteins at the first moment increased with copper exposition but in the long-term exposure decreased significantly respect to control, evidencing a non significant correlation with plasma ion concentrations. Plasma glucose and cortisol levels increased in a dose dependent manner, while showing complex fluctuations during the intermediate exposure times. In conclusion, data suggest that copper induces an early maximum inhibition of gill Na + /K + -ATPase activity in O. niloticus. The subsequent slow decrease in plasma ion levels seems to be related to compensatory mechanisms involving a non-specific stress response.

Aestivation, like hibernation, is characterized by torpor and by cardiorespiratory and metabolic changes (Fishman et al., J. Morphol. 1: 237 -248, 1986) . Recently, an important role of nitric oxide (NO) was suggested in controlling vascular properties of hibernating animals (heart: Kudej and Vatner, J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol., 35: 931 -935, 2003; kidney: Sandovici et al., Nitric Oxide, 11: 194 -200, 2004) . This study provides preliminary information on the presence and the localisation of endothelial nitric oxide synthases (eNOS) in heart and kidney of freshwater P. dolloi. We used immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and NADPH-diaphorase. We firstly identified, on both cardiac and renal extracts, an immunoreactive band corresponding to eNOS molecular weight. In the heart, eNOS immunolocalisation showed an intense signal on the endocardialendothelial cells and a less intense reaction on myocardiocytes. This cardiac distribution pattern is similar to that reported in several species including fish (Pellegrino et al., J. Exp. Biol. 207: 3855 -3864, 2004) . NADPH-diaphorase confirmed the presence of a functional NOS system indicating the presence of NO producing cells in the heart, particularly at the endocardial -endothelial level. In the kidney, eNOS immunoreactivity was confined to the endothelial cells of glomerular vessels and to the apical pole of epithelial tubular cells. Studies are in progress to evaluate the presence of other NOSs isoforms, i.e. iNOS and nNOS. It will be also analysed whether aestivation may modify the expression and/or the tissue distribution of NOS isoforms.",

For example, heart rate ( f H ) of anoxia-tolerant turtles is approximately one-fifth that of the normoxic rate following two to three weeks of anoxia at 5-C . However, this bradycardia is not a result of autonomic inhibition 2 . We tested the hypothesis that the anoxic bradycardia is due, at least in part to the intrinsic responses of the myocardium to the changes in extracellular solution that accompanies anoxia. Specifically, we investigated the effects of anoxia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and adrenaline on intrinsic f H of spontaneously contracting right atria from 5 -C normoxic-and anoxic-acclimated (2 weeks anoxia) turtles. We found that intrinsic f H of atrial preparations from anoxic-acclimated turtles was reset to approximately half that exhibited by atrial preparations from normoxicacclimated animals regardless of the external saline composition. Thus, prolonged anoxic exposure results in a re-setting of intrinsic f H to a reduced level. We further examined this resetting of intrinsic f H by comparing action potential shape and duration in right-atria, left-atria and ventricle from normoxic-and anoxic-acclimated turtles. We found that ventricular action potential duration was approximately 150% longer in anoxic-acclimated turtles than normoxic-acclimated animals. Further, resting membrane potential was increased from approximately \u00c0 60 mV to \u00c0 30 mV. Thus, anoxic-exposure has profound effects on myocardial action potentials, which contribute to reducing cardiac activity. ",

Grosell, (University of Miami, USA, jtaylor@rsmas.miami.edu) Experiments performed on Gulf Toadfish, Opsanus beta, demonstrate how feeding impacts osmoregulation in the marine teleost intestine. Because Ca 2+ and reduced pH have both been shown to stimulate intestinal HCO 3 \u00c0 secretion, Gulf Toadfish were fed a high Ca 2+ diet of chopped pilchards, Sardina pilchardus ([Ca 2+ ] 404.2 mmol kg \u00c0 1 ) and a low Ca 2+ diet of squid ([Ca 2+ ] 1.3 mmol kg \u00c0 1 ). Data were collected in increments from 3 hours to 12 days after feeding. Ion analysis of fluid in segments from the stomach to the rectum in fish fed both diets, particularly one and two days postfeeding, supports evidence that apical Cl \u00c0 /HCO 3 \u00c0 exchange plays a vital role in Cl \u00c0 absorption and osmoregulation, especially during digestion. HCO 3 \u00c0 secretion is important in inhibiting the absorption of Ca 2+ by facilitating CaCO 3 precipitation, and appears to be further stimulated by digestion. No obvious alkaline tide was observed, but plasma osmolality peaked 12 hours post-feeding when intestinal fluid osmolality exceeded that of the extracellular fluid. Additional research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of HCO 3 \u00c0 secretion employed during digestion versus those utilized during osmoregulation in a hyperosmotic environment (Supported by NSF-IBN and a University of Miami graduate student fellowship). Keywords: Osmoregulation, Bicarbonate secretion, Toadfish, Feeding, Diet The present study was undertaken to elucidate the physiological significance of the recently identified mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in rainbow trout. In tetrapods, the MR mediates sodium reabsorption across epithelia and thus it has been hypothesized that the fish MR is also involved in ion regulation. Using immunohistochemistry, MR protein expression was detected at the gill and was found to be colocalized to Na + -K + -ATPase rich chloride cells. Localization of the fish MR to chloride cells suggests that the branchial MR may be involved in ion regulation. Additionally, an in vivo corticosteroid administration protocol was employed to selectively target MR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mediated pathways separately and observe possible effects on renal and branchial ion regulation. The administration of aldosterone for selective MR activation stimulated a decrease in urine flow rate (UFR) and urinary sodium excretion. The administration of cortisol to presumably activate both corticosteroid receptor subtypes resulted in no significant effect on UFR or urinary sodium excretion. These results suggest that the fish renal MR may have a function similar to that of the mammalian renal MR, in that activation of the receptor stimulates sodium and water recovery from the filtrate.

                "text": "This study associates a cellular and molecular approach of the Na + / K + /2Cl \u00c0 cotransporter or NKCC in order to determine the osmoregulatory role of this protein in the sea-bass tissues. The NKCC has been localized by immunofluorescence within the epithelium of the major osmoregulatory sites: gills, intestine and urinary system. The exact cell localization of the cotransporter varies according to the organ in sea-bass maintained in seawater. In the branchial mitochondria-rich cells, the NKCC is localized at the basolateral side, which suggests its involvement in ion secretion. The branchial cotransporter is assimilated to NKCC1. At the intestinal level, the cotransporter is localized at the apical cell side. The urinary ducts and the dorsal part of the urinary bladder also present an apically-localized NKCC, which might be assimilated to NKCC2. An ontogenetical approach has shown that the cotransporter is already expressed in prelarval stages. A salinity challenge of larval and large juvenile sea-bass from seawater to freshwater does not affect the cell localization of the Na + /K + /2Cl \u00c0 cotransporter, but a different NKCC expression is suggested. A molecular approach through real-time PCR has shown variations in the amount of NKCC expressed in the osmoregulatory tissues. Keywords: Salinity, Osmoregulation, Sea-bass, Na + /K + /2Cl \u00c0 cotransporter, Ontogeny Present increases of anthropogenic CO in the atmosphere and surface waters suggest that CO 2 related changes in seawater carbonate chemistry will become a general stress factor in aquatic environments. Our knowledge of compensatory mechanisms for systemic acid -base disturbances in cephalopods is limited. This study preliminarily concludes that Sepia officinalis joins a high capacity of acid -base regulation normally found in vertebrates with the ability to maintain or even slightly decrease aerobic energy turnover during acute hypercapnic exposure. In vivo data collected from cannulated specimens illustrated that a metabolic alkalosis, generated by an active accumulation of bicarbonate ions, was sufficient to fully compensate for the respiratory acidosis and buffer haemolymph pH. Monitoring of brain energy status by P-NMR spectroscopy found only minor shifts in adenylate ratios. Considering the full compensation of haemolymph pH, it is interesting that brain intracellular pH remained depressed under hypercapnia. This suggests a protective function for lowered brain pHi, where tissue specific metabolic depression could support the maintenance of whole animal energy balance during CO stress. Taking into consideration the ability of certain cephalopod species to retain protons and acidic metabolites within the mantle muscle to prevent disturbances of haemolymph homeostasis, further work will focus on measuring the degree of acid -base regulation in muscle tissue. Together these data will allow us to determine if the full level of motoric activity can be conserved in Sepia officinalis during acute hypercapnia. The discovery of the oxygen-binding globin, neuroglobin (Ngb) in nerve cells of the brain and retina of vertebrates has lead to extensive speculations with regard to the function of this globin. Although it has been reported that Ngb is upregulated in cultured neuronal cells exposed to hypoxia (1) and in the brain of rats exposed to ischemia/reperfusion injury (2) no upregulation of Ngb was observed in mice exposed to hypoxia (7 -12% O 2 ) for 48 h (3) or two weeks (10% O 2 ) (4). These contradictory results lead us to investigate whether Ngb is upregulated only in the early phase of a hypoxic episode. We exposed mice to short term (2 h) severe hypoxia (7.6% O 2 ) and examined the Ngb protein distribution and mRNA levels by immunohistochemisty and RT-PCR (Hundahl et al. in press) . Two-hour hypoxic exposure caused no detectable changes in staining intensity or spatial distribution of Ngb neither in the Purkinje cells nor in any other brain areas observed. The RT-PCR data accord with the lack of differences in brain Ngb levels between normal and oxygen-deprived animals. The lack of Ngb upregulation in the brain is consistent with results from previous long-term hypoxic experiments, suggesting that Ngb is not regulated by pure hypoxia in vivo. Keywords: Neuroglobin, Hypoxia, Mouse, Purkinje cells The twisted ducts making up the ingestive gland of Bolinus brandaris are internally lined by a mucosa of prismatic monostratified and ciliated epithelia with large microvilli arranged in rows. This gland performs two functions: oocyte fecundation, and the enzymatic destruction and subsequent resorbption of non-functional spermatozoa. Therefore, these cell structures are related and preserve the optimal conditions for fecundation and enzyme synthesis. The two types of sperm in this species (eupyrene and apyrene) as well as inmature forms, are seen along the duct. These spermatozoa invaginate into the ingestive gland cells, whose enzymatic secretions are spilled over the sperm cells, leading to an initial phase of degradation because plasma membranes are communicated. Not all spermatozoa follow the same route in the degeneration process. In some cases, the axonema degenerates first, while in other cases, fusion of the cryoplasm preceeds degeneration of the axonema. Digestive systems need flexibility to meet energy demands as well as the challenges of the environment. The morphological changes of the intestinal lining of an infrequent feeder were therefore examined using Burmese pythons that fasted for 45 days and different time points after feeding. Before euthanasia, BrdU was injected and replicating cells were viewed using immunohistochemistry. Intestinal segments (proximal, middle and distal segments) were analysed using light and transmission microscopy techniques. Conventional (CSEM) and environmental (ESEM) scanning electron microscopy was also used. Fixed, dehydrated and gold-coated specimens were viewed under CSEM conditions while freshly dissected unfixed samples were observed using the ESEM mode. The intestinal lining of fasting pythons appeared pseudostratified with tightly packed enterocytes presenting very short microvilli. Within 1 day postfeeding, cell hypertophy occurred concurrently with the lengthening of enterocyte microvilli and a significant villus length and intestinal mass increase. Lipid droplets then accumulated, contributing also to epithelium hypertrophy. Using ESEM and semithin sections, lipid droplets were observed at the tips and edges of the villi along the small intestine proximal and middle regions, but remained absent in the distal portion. Cell renewal was already noticeable 24 hours after feeding with up to 26% of the epithelial intestinal cells being renewed 3 days after feeding. By 14 days postfeeding, enterocyte hypotrophy occurred leaving the gut dormant. The key adaptive factor for pythons to cope with infrequent feeding is therefore a dormant gut with unused cells that can quickly restart functioning when food is available again. One glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene is found in humans. By contrast, two genes encoding functional glucocorticoid receptors exist in rainbow trout and other teleost fish, probably resulting from a genome duplication event 350 MYA in the teleost lineage. The two trout GRs, called rtGR1 and rtGR2, are ubiquitously expressed and have similar binding affinity to dexamethasone. Interestingly, however, rtGR1 and rtGR2 markedly differ in their sensitivity to glucocorticoids when analysed in co-transfection transactivation assays (e.g., cortisol EC50s of 46 and 0.72 nM, respectively). This suggests that, within the large dynamic range of physiological cortisol concentrations in fish, the two receptors adopt different functions, becoming activated at different threshold concentrations of ligand. To identify regions determining sensitivity, domain-swap mutants between rtGR1 and rtGR2 were created and functionally analysed in a transactivation assays with COS-7 cells, using a MMTV-luciferase reporter. The recombinant AB(rtGR2)C-DE(rtGR1) and ABC(rtGR2)DE(rtGR1) showed the same sensitivity as rtGR1, while the sensitivities of AB(rtGR1)CDE(rtGR2) and of ABC(rtGR1)DE(rtGR2) were identical with that of rtGR2. The results rule out a prominent role of the A/B-domain, which contains the AF-1 transactivation function, and the C-domain, responsible for DNA binding. The sensitivity of wild type and mutated trout GRs depended on the nature of their carboxy-terminal region encompassing their D-and E-domains, of which the latter is known to contain two further activation functions called tau-2 and AF-2. Crypt-type olfactory receptor neurons (crypt-type ORNs) and chloride cells were identified in the olfactory epithelium of the European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax using immuno-histochemistry for the Na + ,K + -ATPase and the Na + /K + /2Cl \u00c0 cotransporter. Numerous immunopositives cells for both the Na + ,K + -ATPase and for the Na + /K + /2Cl \u00c0 cotransporter were observed in the non sensory epithelium covering the base and the edge of the olfactory lamellae. These cells were identified as chloride cells and their nature was confirmed by electron microscopy. Cells, immunopositive only for the Na + ,K + -ATPase were observed in the sensory epithelium of the olfactory lamellae. Further histological and electron microscopical studies revealed that these cells are specific supporting cells only associated with crypt-type ORNs. No immunostaining was noted in the receptor neuron itself. Crypt-type ORNs have not been described before in the sea bass. They are scattered within the sensory epithelium and relatively much less abundant than ciliated and microvillous ORNs. As described in other fish species, these ORNs are characterized by the presence of ciliae and microvilli. The colocalization of the Na + ,K + -ATPase and the Na + /K + /2Cl \u00c0 cotransporter by immuno-histochemistry provide a new tool to study the distribution of crypt-type ORNs in the olfactory epithelium of marine fish. The abundance of the Na + ,K + -ATPase in the specialized associated supporting cells remain to be explained and deserves more investigations, especially regarding to the function of the crypt-type ORNs which is still unknown (Supported by the FCT, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia, granted project POCTI/ BIA-BCM/60554/2004).

Eddy, (Dundee, F.B.Eddy@dundee.ac.uk) Nitric oxide is recognized as a messenger molecule with major regulatory roles in the nervous, immune and cardiovascular systems not only in mammals but also in lower vertebrates and invertebrates. In the cardiovascular system, vasodilation occurs in response to NO which is released from the vascular epithelium in response to a variety of stimuli including neural and humoral substances such as acetylcholine, bradykinin, ATP as well as hypoxia and sheer stress. The constitutive form of NOS exists in two forms, endothelial NOS (or eNOS) and neuronal NOS (or nNOS) which release relatively small amounts of NO over a short time. Inducible forms of NOS (iNOS) are present in a variety of tissues including epithelia and macrophages, are independent of Ca 2+ and in response to endotoxins and cytokinins, release relatively large amounts of NO for long periods. Exogenously generated NO produced relaxation of fish vascular preparations and cardiovascular effects in vivo e.g. tachycardia in rainbow trout. Evidence now exists for functional NOS in a variety of fish preparations and the circulatory system of juvenile salmonids. As a physiological models the larvae of salmonid fish (alevins) have many advantages including transparency, the beating heart is easily observed, diffusing distances are small, and the response to externally administered chemicals is rapid. Also alevins are available in large numbers and quickly settle to new environments. This model offers excellent opportunities to investigate the role of NO in control of the cardiovascular system in fish and to investigate cardiovascular responses to increased levels of NO generated by substances which stimulate expression of iNOS.",

Whiteley, (Wales, Bangor, n.m. whiteley@bangor.ac.uk) Female edible crabs, Cancer pagurus, spawn several million eggs, which they brood on their abdomen in a large spherical mass for 6 -7 months. During development, the embryos undergo distinct periods of quiescence and rapid growth, which appear to be tightly controlled by the level of oxygen present within the egg mass. At first, the berried females burrow into the substrate and PO 2 levels in contact with the eggs fall to 5 kPa. Four to five months later, the females emerge from the substrata and spend long periods ventilating the egg mass, accelerating the growth of the embryos. The relationship between growth rates and ambient PO 2 was examined by determining whole-egg rates of fractional protein synthesis (k s ) and oxygen uptake (MO ) in C. pagurus embryos at 3 different stages of development: early (gastrula), mid (eye fleck stage) and late (close to hatching). At early stages of development, mean k s was 12 T 3% day \u00c0 1 at a mean MO 2 of 75 T 5 Amol O 2 kg \u00c0 1 . Exposure of the early stage eggs to severe hypoxia (2 kPa) had little effect on either, k s or MO 2 . At the mid stage, however, there was a significant increase in mean k s to 32 T 7% day \u00c0 1 accompanied by an increase in MO to 93 T 6 Amol O 2 kg \u00c0 1 . At this stage, the crab eggs were more sensitive to hypoxia. By the time the embryos were close to hatching, k s had declined to values that were more in keeping with early stage embryos, even though oxygen uptake rates had continued to increase.

Whiteley, (Wales, Bangor, n.m. whiteley@bangor.ac.uk) Specific dynamic action, or the increase in oxygen uptake rate following feeding, was examined in Carcinus maenas in order to determine if moderate hypoxia (8.7 T 0.7 kPa) is sufficient to inhibit an increase in oxygen demand at a time when oxygen supply is limited. Rates of oxygen uptake (MO ) were measured in starved crabs fed a single meal and either, left in normoxic conditions or exposed to moderate hypoxia for 5 and 24 h before the water was re-aerated. In normoxic crabs, MO 2 peaked at 3 h post-feeding to a value that was 2.05 T 0.18 times higher than the pre-feeding value. The duration of the SDA response was 8 h. In contrast, the SDA response in hypoxic crabs was delayed until the water was reaerated. The subsequent SDA response after 5 h of hypoxia peaked at 3 h re-aeration to mark a 2.30 T 0.18 fold increase in MO 2 from pre-feeding values. A similar response was recorded after 24 h hypoxia, as MO 2 also peaked at 3 h post hypoxia to give a 1.97 T 0.38 fold increase in MO . Control experiments in which unfed crabs were exposed to both normoxia and hypoxia showed no significant changes in oxygen uptake rates over time. Consequently, the SDA response in Carcinus can be delayed for up to 24 h as a result of environmental hypoxia, probably due to the inhibition of digestion and consequent release of amino acids into the circulation, which usually increases rates of protein synthesis and, therefore, oxygen demand.

Bolus intra-arterial injections of ET-1 (1 -1000 ng kg \u00c0 1 ) caused a dose-dependent systemic vasodilatation that was associated with a decrease in systemic pressure ( P sys ) and a rise in systemic blood flow ( Q sys ) causing systemic conductance ( G sys ) to increase. ET-1 had no significant effects on the pulmonary circulation, heart rate ( f H ) or total stroke volume (VS tot ). This response differs markedly from mammals where ET-1 causes an initial vasodilatation that is followed by a pronounced pressure response. In mammals, the initial dilatation is caused by stimulation of ET B -receptor, while the subsequent constriction is mediated by ET A -receptors. In the turtles, infusion of the ET Breceptor agonist BQ-3020 (300 ng kg \u00c0 1 ) elicited haemodynamic changes that were similar to those of ET-1, and the effects of ET-1 were not affected by the ET A -antagonist BQ-610 (100 Ag kg \u00c0 1 ). Conversely, all effects of ET-1 were virtually abolished after specific ET B -receptor blockade with the ET B -antagonist BQ-788 (100 Ag kg \u00c0 1 ). The subsequent treatment with the general ET receptor antagonist tezosentan (10 mg kg \u00c0 1 ) did not produce effects that differed from the treatment with ET B -antagonist and the blockade of ET-1 responses persisted.

In-vivo (Evans blue) and postmortem (triphenyltetrazolium chloride, TTC) staining were used to detect myocardial necrosis.

In all animals, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (Psys) and heart rate ( f H ) were measured at rest and during enforced activity. Four days after occlusion, the snakes could still maintain a Psys and f H of 5.29 kPa and 94.3 beats min \u00c0 1 , respectively, during activity. This was not different from sham operated snakes.

However, on the basis of a an integrative model that allows for quantitative predictions of blood gases at various blood flows, cardiac shunt and ventilation, it can be shown that cardiac mixing allows for large changes in arterial oxygen levels with very small changes in arterial PCO 2 and acid -base status. In contrast, achieving a similar reduction in arterial oxygen levels by hypoventilation, would lead to a severe respiratory acidosis. This difference largely reflects the high capacitance for CO 2 in blood and tissues compared to that of oxygen. Thus, if arterial oxygen levels indeed affect metabolism, it seems to better a better strategy to mediate the low arterial oxygen levels by means of cardiac shunting rather than ventilatory adjustments.

In the present work we looked at the contribution of the gut, which functions as an accessory breathing organ (ABOs), to ammonia elimination. We have determined the localized by immunofluorescence (IF) and abundance in crude tissue homogenates quantified by Western blotting of a number of ion transport proteins including Na + /K + -ATPase, V-ATPase, NKCC, and CFTR to the anterior part of the intestine. We have been yet unable to identify an apical Cl \u00c0 / HCO 3 \u00c0 exchanger (putative anion transporter 1 (PAT1), or Pendrin) which we predicted is involved in the gut surface alkalinization necessary for ammonia volatilization. In the poster a model is proposed for the mechanism of gut ammonia volatilization and our results are discussed. In the present work we also used a pharmacological approach to determine the contribution of different branchial ion transport pathways to ammonia excretion (J AMM ). Amiloride (0.1 mM sodium transport inhibitor), SITS (0.1 mM Cl \u00c0 /HCO 3 \u00c0 inhibitor) and bafilomycin A1 (1AM V-ATPase inhibitor) were added to the water and J AMM measured. Only bafilomycin significantly inhibited J AMM which resulted in a doubling of plasma total ammonia levels although statistically insignificant. The addition of Tris buffer to eliminate boundary layer pH gradients progressively increases the tissue load of ammonia with pH. Taken together these results indicate that boundary layer acidification is important for determining transbranchial ammonia fluxes. This work was supported by FCT grant POCTI/BSE/47585/2002.",

Implicit in a successfully switch from active ion excretion to ion uptake is a dramatic change in the expression of the ion transport proteins in the gill, the major osmoregulatory organ in fishes. Na + /K + -ATPase (NKA) is a key enzyme in driving branchial ion fluxes. In the present study we adapted glasseels captured from the Minho River estuary to distilled water (DW), fresh water (FW: dechlorinated Porto tap water), 25, 50, 100 and 150% sea water (SW: 32\u00b0Salinity) for 10 days.

The dynamic energy budget theory identifies these rules, and allows the quantification of how individuals acquire and utilize energy and nutrients. The energy budget of an organism may change due to variations in the amount of food supply in the environment and/or due to its own design. Hummingbirds (Trochilidae, Apodiformes) are an energetic extreme in the evolution of birds because of their energetically demanding hovering flight. While feeding during hovering, hummingbirds display some of the highest mass specific rates of aerobic metabolism and muscle power output among vertebrates. The body size distribution of the approximately 340 species of hummingbirds is such that 70% of them weigh six grams or less and 30% of the species weight between six and ten grams. The giant hummingbird, Patagona gigas, is an outlier in the distribution of hummingbird body sizes since it weighs about 20 g. Considering the influence of body mass on the magnitude at which animals expend energy it is not unreasonable to suggest the existence of energetic constraints on the evolution of body size. So, we tested the idea that P. gigas may be at the upper power limit for hummingbirds which may explain the magnitude of its extreme size.

As the animals under study are not physically connected with the recording units, they behave more normally, which improves the data quality. It also allows the study of social interactions, and long term recordings make it possible to study not only diurnal but also seasonal changes. Currently, a variety of different biological signals can be measured using telemetry but one of the more important variables in cardiovascular studies, blood flow, has not been available until now. We present a fully implantable biotelemetry system with capacity for long-term recording of blood flow, blood pressure, ECG and temperature. The system allows up to 4 channels of blood flow, 3 channels of blood pressure, ECG and temperature simultaneously. The system uses 1 mm diameter, high-fidelity miniature Millar (3F) tip transducer catheters to record blood pressure and 20 MHz Doppler probes for blood flow monitoring. A base station is used for decoding the incoming data and for control of the implant. Output from the base station is both analog and RS232. Control commands to the implant are sent using a touch screen LCD on the base station. Preliminary bench and in vivo animal tests have been performed to evaluate system performance. Results from the in vivo studies show that this biotelemetry system is capable of long term accurate monitoring of simultaneous blood flow and pressure which was not available before from a totally implantable biotelemetry system.

To investigate if nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the control of light production in krill, specimens were injected with nitrergic drugs and the intensity and duration of the light response was measured. Values below are mean intensity during 10 min around peak value. Specimen injected with NO-donor (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, SNAP; 0.3 mM) and 5HT (0.03 mM) emitted light of lower intensity (526.9 T 488.1 Mq/s, N = 8) than the individuals injected with 5HT (0.03 mM, 1999.0 T 1750.5 Mq/s, N = 10) only. A cGMP analogue (8-Br-cGMP, 0.3 mM) did not affect the 5HT (0.03 mM) stimulated light response (1892.1 T 864.1 Mq/s and 1999.0 T 1750.5 Mq/s, respectively, N = 10). To prevent endogenous NO-production the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor Nxnitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME; 3 mM) was injected with 5HT (0.03 mM). l-NAME appeared to enhance the intensity of the response to 5HT in most individuals, but this needs further study. Possible locations for NO production in the light organs were detected using antibodies against NOS. NOS-like immunoreactivity was found in nerve-like structures at the entrance of vessels to the light organ, and in cells hypothesized to regulate hemolymph supply to the lantern (the location for light production). Results suggest that NO may be produced in the light organs of M. norvegica and may have a modulating influence on the 5HT-stimulated light response.

Therefore, we compared the myocardia of the two species as regards hypoxic force development and metabolic capacities. Myocardial strips from painted turtle maintained twitch force better than those from red-eared slider during a stepwise lowering of oxygen tension. The glycolytic capacity in terms of pyruvate kinase activity and the cytochrome oxidase activity were 27% and 130% higher, respectively, in painted turtle than in red-eared slider myocardium. The higher cytochrome oxidase acitivity is remarkable because the myocardia of the two species had similar activity of citrate synthase, an indicator of mitochondrial density. Furthermore, their mitochondrial respiratory capacity was similar as recorded in skinned fibres subjected to increasing ADP-concentrations in the absence and presence of creatine. Thus, the myocardium of painted turtle seems to possess an excessive capacity of cytochrome oxidase. In conclusion, the higher hypoxic contractility of myocardium from painted turtle relative to that recorded for red-eared slider may relate to its higher anaerobic capacity. However, its apparent excess of cytochrome oxidase activity deserves further studies as it may increase oxygen affinity and support performance under oxygen lack.

Preliminary results show that specific dynamic action (SDA) variables including the duration and amplitude are influenced by the oxygen saturation. At hypoxia, the SDA had a longer duration (165 T 14 h) vs (82 T 10 h) and lower maximum amplitude (112 T 4 mg O 2 kg \u00c0 1 h \u00c0 1 ) vs (156 T 10 mg O 2 kg \u00c0 1 h \u00c0 1 ) than that observed under normoxic conditions.

In addition, the maximum metabolic scope (MS) of 29 similar sized cod (126 T 4.6 g; mean T S.E.) was determined under progressive hypoxia.

Steinhausen and J.F. Steffensen, (Copenhagen, Denmark, mfpetersen@bi.ku.dk) Information of the energy demand of swimming fish is of high importance for bioenergetic modelling which are used to address fisheries research problems. For some fish species, however, it has been demonstrated that spontaneous activity is more expensive compared with steady linear swimming. Since swimming cost used in bioenergetic models is often estimated using empirical relationships between oxygen consumption and forced swimming, the activity cost may thus be underestimated. To study this, the oxygen consumption of 8 seabream was measured in a circular respirometer during spontaneous activity. The 2D position of the fish was registered using a video camera and the activity pattern was analysed in swimming speed, acceleration/deceleration and turning rate. Oxygen consumption increased exponentially with swimming speed, acceleration as well as turning rate. To test the hypothesis that spontaneous swimming is energetic more expensive than steady linear swimming, 7 seabream were forced to swim in a swimming respirometer. Oxygen consumption was measured at different levels of swimming speed and increased exponentially with increasing speed. Comparing regression from the models describing the relationship between oxygen consumption and swimming speed showed that spontaneous activity was more expensive compared with forced activity and this tendency increases with swimming speed. 2.45 times more energy was used when swimming spontaneously at an average speed of 0.5 Bls \u00c0 1 compared with the same speed during forced activity. Keywords: Metabolic rate, Seabream, Activity, Swimming cost ratio Here, we analyze adjusts in a lizard species, at behavioral (thermal preference), physiological (digestion and metabolism) and anatomical (internal organs morphometry) levels, to cope with changes in food availability (proxy variable of competition pressure) and tail autotomy (proxy variable of predation pressure). Specifically, we compare the following groups: tailed animals with high food availability (T+/F+), tailess animals with high food availability (T\u00c0/F+), tailed animals with low food availability (T+/F\u00c0), and tailess animals with low food availability (T\u00c0/F\u00c0). After acclimation, we found that: (i) body mass balance and food assimilation were greater in F+ groups, (ii) T\u00c0/F\u00c0 animals tend to prefer higher temperatures than the other groups, (iii) digestibility and metabolism were greater in T\u00c0 groups, (iv) gut gross morphology did not varied among groups, and (v) dry mass of several organs were greater in F+ groups, and particularly in the F+/T\u00c0 group. Thus, different groups appear to follows different strategies, which goes from increase energetic entries and expenditures (T\u00c0/F+, i.e., when there are high necessities and high resources), to decrease both (T+/F\u00c0, i.e., when there are low necessities and low resources). In addition, following different strategies animals could reach a similar final value, but by different mechanisms (e.g., high digestibility by T\u00c0 groups). The present work illustrate the complex interplay between physiological and ecological factors, which in last instance determine organism fitness.",

We compared the variability of the intracellular FAA pool in both bivalves for the first time on a large spatial scale. Bivalves were sampled seasonally at 4 oligo-/mesohaline Baltic Sea sites, 4 Atlantic estuaries and 2 Mediterranean sites. The FAA sum ranged between 100 -500 Amol g \u00c0 1 DW and was correlated to the habitat salinity. The FAA pool in Atlantic and Mediterranean populations was mainly composed of taurine (50% in Mytilus, 20% in Macoma) as well as of glycine and alanine. The taurine fraction was significantly smaller in mesohaline habitats. Long-term salinity acclimation experiments in the field and in the lab (salinity change of T 10 PSU) showed that both bivalve taxa were able to adapt to hypo-and hypersaline conditions by adjusting mainly their glycine and alanine pool within the first week of exposure. The concentration of taurine was declining in case of hypoosmotic conditions after 48 hrs in both bivalves whereas brackish water-adapted specimens were not able to increase their taurine concentration significantly following hyperosmotic exposure. Whether the lack of taurine accumulation in brackish water adapted specimens is related to differences in enzyme kinetics and/or gene expression has to be further studied.

Age of fish were determined by using scale. Results showed that mean fork length in male and female were 198.14 T 26.13 mm, 225.84 T 35.60 mm, respectively. Body weight for male and female were measured 127.43 T 5.45 gr, and 157.73 T 71.03 gr, respectively. Relationship between fork length and body weight were obtained as following: Female: W = 0.7 * 10 \u00c0 3 FL 2.289 (r = 0.8267) Male: W = 5.8 * 10 \u00c0 3 FL 1.885 (r = o.8201) Results of Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) revealed that peak of spawning for males and females occurred in March and April, respectively. Keywords: Biology, Rutilus, Caspian Sea, Iran During the present of study 1145 specimens of Capoeta capoeta gracilis were collected from November 2001 -February 2002 at monthly interval from two sampling area at Shiroud River, Iran. The prevalence and abundance of Diplostomum spathaceum were significantly higher in the station 1 which is close to Caspian Sea. The results show significant differences in the abundance and prevalence of parasite between male and female, these values are higher in the female fish. The prevalence and abundance increase with host length. Present study revealed significant seasonal variations in the abundances and prevalences of D. spathaceum. In the present study 580 specimens of the common gobies, Pomatoschistus mirops and P. minutus from Three Cliffs, South West Wales. Sampling was carried out for a year at monthly intervals. Analysis of seasonal variation in the sex ratio, growth parameters and in the prevalence and abundance of helminthes parasites indicate that the gobies, P. microps (Kr\u00f8yer) and P. minutus (Pallas), at Pennard Pill, Three Cliffs and West Cross, Swansea Bay, leave the nursery areas for up shore nesting areas around April and June, respectively with juveniles and spent adults returning in August and September. Winter off shore migrations is not appearing in these populations. The separation of fish into juveniles and spent adults, based on bimodality of length frequency histograms in August to October, is confirmed by cluster analysis of parasite and host data and also by the prevalence and abundance of some parasite species.

Grzyb and E.F. Skorkowski, (Gdansk University Biological Station, Poland, Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme participating in ATP homeostasis and is typically found in tissues with high-energy demand. In contrast to the cytosolic CK isoenzymes that are dimeric, mitochondrial CKs generally exist as octamers but dynamic octamer/dimer equilibrium has been found in vitro depending on various parameters. The rapid dissociation of octamers into dimers is possible after adding a transition state analog complex (TSAC) an artificial dimerization complex (Schlattner and Wallimann, 2000) . The octameric structures, which differ in electrophoretic mobility and stability, have been found in herring skeletal muscle and spermatozoa. Our results indicate that incubation of octamers from skeletal muscle and spermatozoa with TSAC substrates lead to dissociation into dimers similarly to octamers from other species. The octamers from skeletal muscle were incubated with TSAC, which caused octamer destabilization and about 50% of octamers dissociated into dimers within 8 h at 4 -C. Incubation octamers from spermatozoa with TSAC in the same conditions caused almost complete dissociation of spermatozoa octamers into dimers. These assays indicate that octamers from spermatozoa are less stable then octamers from skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, a temperature increase to 30 -C did not destabilize octameric structure of both isoforms. Keywords: Creatine kinase, Herring, Fish Schlattner, U., Wallimann, T., 2000.

Box 19735 -166, Email: shila2462462@yahoo.co.in) The actinomycetes are common soil gram positive bacteria and best known for their ability to produce unusual metabolites which have antibiotic and cytotoxic properties. Also it is documented that actinomycetes can be isolated from marine habitats. The purposed of this work has been screen the actinomycetes whit cytotoxic activity from corals and sponges at larak Island in Persian Gulf. In this research work cytotoxic activity of actinomycetes has been studied by use of Brine Shrimp Lethal test on Artemia franciscana then the results has been compared with those obtained from Artemia urmiana and the results shows that marine actinomycetes cultures have 14.75% cytotoxic activity .The results of statiatical studies have shown corelation of the tow species as follows (r = 0.98 and P < 0.1). Therefore this results indicate that marine actinomyceyes could be used as source of cytotoxic drug and also we could used Artemia urmiana instead of Artemia franciscana.

Box 19735-166, e-mail: shila2462462@yahoo. co.in) The bacteriological analysis of samples of mussel Mytilaster lineatus used as a biological indicator had shown a microbiological pollution of two station in the Caspian sea. 300 samples mytilaster lineatus harvested from two station shelfish water in south Caspian sea. Experiments were carried out with use of classical test (fecal coliforms, total count mesophils bacteria and psychrophil bacteria). Results show that station one with1 \u00c210 4 CFU g \u00c0 1 E. coli and 2 \u00c2 10 6 CFU g \u00c0 1 total count mesophil bacteria and 2 \u00c2 10 5 CFU g \u00c0 1 psychrophil bacteria a and station two with 1 \u00c210 4 CFU g \u00c0 1 E. coli and 2 \u00c2 10 6 mesophil bacteria and 2 \u00c2 10 5 CFU g \u00c0 1 scycrophile bacteria. The station one near a river with lot of antropogenic source pollution so the number of E. coli was high and the number psychrophil bacteria reduce, in the station two the number of E. coli reduce and the number of psychrophil bacteria increase so the results show we could use these mussels as a statuary bioindicator. Keywords: Bacteria, Bioindicator, Mytilaster lineatus, Pollution Pythons are sit-and-wait predators that can eat extremely large meals under natural conditions. Digestion lasts for days and is associated with a large rise in oxygen consumption, and a rapid growth of many visceral organs 1 . Recently, it has been shown that the mass of the heart of Burmese pythons increases by almost 40% within 48 h after ingestion of meals amounting to 25% of the body mass of the snake 2 . This ventricular growth is associated with a large increase in mRNA for myosin heavy chain, the contractile element, and an unaltered wet to dry mass ratio . In mammals, long-term changes in functional demands on the heart, for example during chronic exercise training, also increases heart size, termed physiological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The traininginduced LVH is beneficial for cardiac function, as the increased stroke volume leads to decreased resting and submaximal heart rates, allowing for increased filling time. Cardiac growth in mammals is generally considered to be hypertrophic, whereas the heart of fish grows through both hyperplasic and hypertrophic mechanisms 3 . Nothing is known about heart growth in reptiles. In the present study we examine the postprandial growth of the python heart using recent developed stereologic methods 4 to examine both macro-and microscopic changes. Secor, S. M. and Diamond, J.

Exp Biol, 207, 2539 -2550 (2004 Few data are available on the development and life cycles of seaslugs (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Opisthobranchia). Usually they possess planktotrophic larvae which develop slowly, although many species do have short larval phases or even direct development. However, in recent years, these animals have been widely studied because of their interesting defensive systems, which comprise mechanical, behavioral and chemical strategies. The studies on the chemical ecology of this group revealed a large variety of natural products and chemical strategies which may be used against sympatric predators for defense. Some of these molecules come from the diet on which the seaslugs feed upon and are incorporated into tissues or specific organs or structures, while other compounds are de novo biosynthesized by the opisthobranchs. In this study we selected species with different strategies: Doris verrucosa and Elysia timida which biosynthesize its own metabolites, Hypselodoris picta, which obtains compounds from diet, and Hypselodoris orsini which transforms dietary metabolites. We cultured these species in the laboratory and then we analyzed the presence of the chemicals during their early development by using HPLC. Preliminary results indicate that early larval phases of D. verrucosa do not contain the verrucosins, while another compound, xylosil-MTA, instead, is present only during the first days of development, and therefore biosynthesis of verrucosins starts after the early larval phases. H. picta, instead, does not possess any defensive chemical from the prey in the larval phases. The postprandial morphological changes of the digestive tract of Burmese pythons were examined using fasting pythons and different time points after feeding. Stomach and intestinal segments were analysed using light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy techniques. Before euthanasia, BrdU was injected and replicating cells were viewed using immunohistochemistry. In fasting pythons, gastric chief cells in fundic crypts were packed with secretory vesicles and parietal cells presented typical non-active, ultrastructural features. Twelve hours after feeding, these cells were active and crypts were enlarged. Duplicating cells at the neck region of the fundic glands were mostly observed 3 days after feeding. Within the intestinal lining, tightly packed enterocytes of fasting pythons were arranged in a pseudostratified fashion and presented very short microvilli. Their width increased by 23% within 1 day postfeeding, inducing a significant villus length and intestinal mass increase. Feeding also sparked the lengthening of enterocyte microvilli 4.8fold within 24 h. Lipid droplets then accumulated concurrently with and contributing to epithelium hypertrophy. They appeared at the tips and edges of the villi along the small intestine proximal and middle regions, but remained absent in the distal portion. Cell renewal was noticeable 24 hours after feeding with up to 26% of the epithelial intestinal cells being renewed 3 days after feeding. Following the completion of digestion, postprandial responses were reversed, enterocytes atrophied and microvilli retracted. By experiencing a wide range of trophic responses with each meal, the Burmese python is therefore a very attractive model to study the cellular mechanisms of gut plasticity.

Weber, (University of Ottawa, Canada, dominique.maillet@science.uottawa.ca) Each fall, the semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) stops in the Bay of Fundy (Canadian Atlantic coast) to build large fat reserves before its non-stop flight to South America. During this two-week stopover, body mass is doubled by feeding on a crustacean (Corophium volutator) containing extremely high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), most notably 31% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Elevated PUFA content in muscle phospholipids have been shown to increase membrane fluidity, thereby accelerating cellular lipid uptake and, possibly, improving endurance. In mammals, dietary EPA and other n-3 PUFAs are also known to increase mitochondrial content. We hypothesized that dietary EPA could be used by semipalmated sandpipers as a natural ''performance enhancing'' substance to prime their flight muscles for migration. Birds were collected at various stages of fat loading throughout the stopover to measure changes in percent body fat, fatty acid composition of muscle phospholipids, and muscle citrate synthase activity, an index of mitochondrial content. We found that EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were rapidly incorporated in flight muscle phospholipids, whereas the content of all other fatty acids did not vary. During the stopover, muscle phospholipid content of EPA (8-fold increase) and DHA (3-fold increase), as well as muscle citrate synthase activity were all correlated with percent body fat ( P < 0.05). These changes are consistent with the stimulatory effects of EPA on aerobic capacity and endurance previously observed in mammals. Dietary PUFAs may therefore be used as pharmacological agents to prepare the flight muscles of long-distance migrant shorebirds for extreme endurance exercise.

Blanco, I. Soto, T.H. L\u00f3 pez-Roca and J.M. Blagburn, (Institute of Neurobiology, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico, rblanco@neurobio.upr.clu.edu) Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical gas produced by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that acts as a signal messenger in the nervous system. The objective of this study was to determine the changes in NOS expression in the retina and tectum of the adult frog, Rana pipiens, after optic nerve axotomy and the application of the growth factor FGF-2. Frog optic nerves were cut and immediately treated with FGF-2 or saline solution. Retinas and tecta were dissected and processed for immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. In the control retina NOS immunoreactivity was found in Muller cells, in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), in cells of the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and in some cells of the inner nuclear layer (INL). Axotomy decreased the amount of NOS protein in the retina. FGF-2 application to the injured optic nerve increased NOS immunoreactivity in the GCL. NOS was also found in neurons of the tectum and the retinorecipent tectal layer 9. Axotomy decreased NOS immunoreactivity in tectal layer 9, while a significant increase in NOS expression was observed after FGF-2 treatment. In conclusion, axotomy decreases NOS immunoreactivity in axonal processes in the tectum. Application of FGF-2 after axotomy increases NOS in both retina and tectum. Supported by NIH S06 GM08224.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided in three groups. First, an Intermittent hypobaric hypoxia exposure (IHHE) group with rats exposed at 5,000 m simulated altitude for four-hour daily sessions, carried out during five days per week until completing 22 days of hypoxia exposure and samples taken at the end of the exposure period. Second group (POST) was submitted simultaneously to the same IHHE programme, but samples were obtained after the period of 22 days. Finally, a control group was used. Hypobaric hypoxia exposed rats showed significantly ( P < 0.05) higher myocardial CD and FD than the control group: IHHE (CD=4914T 543 capillary/mm 2 , FD= 3375 T 189 fibers/mm 2 ), POST (CD = 5227 T 427 capillary/mm 2 , FD = 3483 T 76 fibers/mm 2 ) and control (CD = 4206 T 600 capillary/mm 2 , FD = 3025 T 341 fibers/mm 2 ). Indices expressing the relationship between the number of capillaries in contact with a fibre and its cross-sectional area or perimeter showed significant increases in IHHE animals (22% for area index and 14% for perimeter index) and POST animals (33% for area index and 23% for perimeter index) as compared to control rats. All these results clearly indicate an increased myocardial capillarization in hypobaric hypoxia exposed rats. Moreover, morphological descriptors of fibre size such as FCSA (control = 264 T 40 Am 2 , IHHE = 224 T 19 Am 2 , POST = 210 T 10 m 2 ) and MDD (control = 18 T 1.4 Am, IHHE = 16.5 T 0.7 Am, POST = 16 T 0.3 Am) showed an opposite trend, indicating a reduced oxygen diffusion distance in myocardium fibers in exposed animals. Keywords: Hypobaric chamber, Intermittent hypoxia, Capillarization, Myocardium Most higher organisms use time-keeping devices to anticipate environmental change and coordinate their behaviour and physiology accordingly. Terrestrial organisms have a Fcircadian clock_ that is entrained by daily light and dark cycles. In invertebrates the central clock mechanism resides in neuronal clusters in the brain where oscillator cells express a rhythmic, daily flux of Fclock_ transcripts and proteins, coordinated in transcription/translation feedback loops. We are investigating an intertidal isopod crustacean, Eurydice pulchra, which has a robust circa-tidal (12.4 h) swimming rhythm entrained by the ebb and flow of the tides. Using behavioural analysis, immunochemical localisation and quantitative RT-PCR, based on sequence information obtained from a high quality cDNA library, we have begun dissecting the Eurydice clock system in an attempt to expose its cellular and molecular basis. We are interested in whether the same identified circadian components also drive the circatidal oscillator. We show the cellular localisation of proteins homologous to Drosophila central clock components including PERIOD, CYCLE and CLOCK and the putative output peptides, pigment dispersing hormone (PDH) and crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH). We show also the temporal expression of the gene transcripts, period cycle clock and CHH in Eurydice brains over complete tidal and daily cycles.

                "text": "The effect of an intermittent hypobaric hypoxia exposure (IHHE) programme on morphofunctional parameters related to gas exchange on diaphragm muscle of rats was studied. The IHHE programme was performed in a hypobaric chamber (5,000 m simulated altitude) and consisted of four-hour daily sessions, carried out during five days per week until completing 22 days of hypoxia exposure. Samples were taken at the end of the exposure period (IHHE group) and 20 days after the end of programme (POST group) and compared to a control group. Capillary (CD) and fiber density (FD) were significantly higher ( P < 0.05) in IHHE (CD = 780 T 60 capillary/mm 2 , FD = 395 T 55 fibers/mm 2 ) compared to control group (CD = 600 T 100 capillary/mm 2 , FD = 332 T 36 fibers/mm 2 ). However, capillary-to-fiber ratio (CD/ FD) and number of capillaries contacting a fiber were not significantly different. Indices expressing the relationship between the number of capillaries contacting a fiber and its cross-sectional area or perimeter showed significant increases in IHHE and POST versus control rats in all fiber types, with higher values ranging from 12% to 28%. Fiber cross-sectional area (FCSA) and perimeter (FPER) in SO fibers were significantly lower in IHHE (FCSA= 1606 T 230 Am 2 , FPER = 164 T 10 Am) than in control rats (FCSA= 1898 T 166 Am 2 , FPER=180T 8 Am). However, no changes were detected for those parameters in FG and FOG fiber types. Moreover, non-significant differences in the fibre shape nor in fiber-type percentage were found. Results seem to indicate that morphofunctional changes in diaphragm muscle induced by short-intermittent exposure to hypobaric hypoxia are related to the fiber contractile properties instead of its oxidative character.

                "text": "We examined the effect of intermittent hypobaric hypoxia exposure on some myocardial metabolism parameters such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, as a marker of glycolytic anaerobic metabolism, myoglobin (Mb), a key oxygen storage protein, and total protein concentration. The intermittent hypobaric hypoxia exposure (IHHE) programme was performed in a hypobaric chamber (5,000 m simulated altitude) and consisted of four-hour daily sessions, carried out during five days per week until completing 22 days of hypoxia exposure. Samples were taken to a group of animals (IHHE) at the end of the exposure period and to other group (POST) 20 days after the end of programme and compared to a control (CONT) group. LDH activity was significantly depressed ( P < 0.05) in the hearts of IHHE and POST groups when compared with control (IHHE = 367 T 46 IU/g wet tissue, POST = 288 T 20 IU/g wet tissue, CONT = 382 T 80 IU/g wet tissue, respectively). A reverse trend was observed in myocardium myoglobin with significant increments of 10%, and 25% ( P < 0.01) in IHEE and POST groups, (IHEE = 4,63 T 0,4 mg Mb/g wet tissue and POST = 5,23 T 0,5 mg Mb/g wet tissue versus CONT= 4,20 T 0,5 mg Mb/g). No significant differences were found between the three experimental groups in protein total concentration. In conclusion, a 4-week programme of short-intermittent exposure to hypobaric hypoxia enhance oxidative characteristics of heart muscle as deducted from a reduction in LDH activity and the increased internal oxygen storage and diffusive capacity of myocardium.

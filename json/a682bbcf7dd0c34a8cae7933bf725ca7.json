    "abstract": "In shrimp aquaculture, eyestalk ablation is the only technique that is widely used to accelerate ovarian development. Alternative methods for producing improved ovarian development in broodstock are currently being investigated. Several factors involved in the regulation of ovarian development in shrimp have been investigated. Among these factors, growth factors in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily have been implicated as playing potential roles in the regulation of gonad development. In this work, a member of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily known as glass bottom boat (GBB), an ortholog of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), was investigated to uncover its role in ovarian development in the banana shrimp Fenneropenaeus merguiensis. Full-length cDNA of FmGBB was obtained from transcriptome data. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the sequence of FmGBB from banana shrimp was similar to those of other arthropods and vertebrate BMP 5/6/7, but was different from those of decapentaplegic proteins and vertebrate BMP 2/4. The FmGBB transcript was found to be widely expressed in shrimp tissues, and its expression in the ovary was dramatically increased in early and late vitellogenic stages during ovarian development and decreased in the mature stage, suggesting its role in vitellogenesis. To study the effects of FmGBB, a soluble recombinant mature FmGBB peptide (His-TF-rgbb) containing both monomers and homodimers was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. The His-TF-rgbb peptide triggered oocyte proliferation in both cultured ovarian explants and in previtellogenic shrimp upon injection. Interestingly, the injection of His-TF-rgbb into previtellogenic female shrimp stimulated an increase in Vg expression in their ovaries while suppressing production of 20-hydroxyecdysone. Our results suggest the potential role of FmGBB in oocyte proliferation and vitellogenesis; this novel finding can be utilized to stimulate ovarian development in cultured shrimp.",

Since the eyestalks of crustaceans are a source of gonad-inhibiting hormone (GIH), which plays an inhibitory role in vitellogenesis and ovarian development (Feijo et al., 2016; Treerattrakool et al., 2008) , the removal of the eyestalk leads to a reduction in GIH that results in the stimulation of ovarian maturation. However, since eyestalk ablation can be performed only once per one female broodstock, this technique should be avoided through the use of other methods, such as the improvement of shrimp nutrition (Wouters et al., 2001) ; the injection of stimulating hormones, such as serotonin (Makkapan et al., 2011) ; and the investigation of the genes involved in gonad development (Nagaraju, 2011) .",

FmGBB contains an Nterminal signal peptide, a pro-domain and a mature peptide at a C-terminal domain (Fig. 1) , which is similar to the general structure of growth factors in the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily (Roch and Sherwood, 2014). The mature FmGBB peptide sequence was found to be highly similar to that of other arthropods as well as that of vertebrate BMP 5/6/7 (Fig. 2a) ; whereas, its sequence differs significantly from that of insect DPP and vertebrate BMP 2/4 (Fig. 2b) , which suggests that FmGBB belongs to the GBB and BMP 5/6/7 subgroups. The conserved sequence corresponding to the cystine knot hormone was found in the amino acid sequence of mature FmGBB, and three intramolecular disulfide bonds were predicted to form among the six cysteine residues within the mature FmGBB sequence (Fig. 2a) , similar to that observed in members of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily (Roch and Sherwood, 2014), suggesting that the tertiary structure of FmGBB is most likely a cystine knot structure. The remaining unpaired cysteine residue in mature FmGBB may contribute to the formation of homodimers. However, we found that the His-TF-rgbb peptide mainly existed in a monomer and less in a homodimer (Fig.   5 ), indicating that the formation of the homodimer of the His-TF-rgbb may bind with other covalent bonds not a disulfide bond.",

                "text": "Here, the effects of purified His-TF-rgbb peptide on oocyte proliferation and Vg expression were determined both in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that the His-TFrgbb peptide could induce oocyte proliferation in ovarian explant cultures as well as in shrimp injected with His-TF-rgbb ( Fig. 6b and 7a ), suggesting its role in the stimulation of oocyte proliferation in the shrimp ovary. Similarly, treatment with BMP-5 was shown to influence granulosa cell proliferation in rat ovaries (Pierre et al., 2005) . Follicle cell proliferation was shown to be stimulated by BMP-2, -4, 6 and -7 in sheep (Juengel et al., 2006) . In ovarian explant cultures, treatment with either His-TF-rgbb or His-TF alone led to reduced Vg expression ( Fig. 6c ) most likely due to the negative effects of various materials in FBS on the active substances. FBS and BSA were previously demonstrated to interact with active compounds, such as epigallocatechin gallate, which resulted in a decrease in intracellular oxygen species (Zhang et al., 2016) . Therefore, the reduction in Vg expression upon His-TF or His-TF-rgbb treatment may result from the FBS supplementation. The other assumption is that GBB did not directly activate on the ovary for the Vg expression. Interestingly, Vg expression was dramatically increased in shrimp injected with His-TF-rgbb, while His-TF alone led to decreased Vg expression on days 2, 7 and 9 after injection (Fig. 7 b-d ). The differences in the effects of His-TF-rgbb on Vg expression in vitro and in vivo may suggest that the vitellogenesis-stimulating activity of FmGBB is mediated by FmGBB-inducible factors in shrimp or activated by the interaction of FmGBB with other molecules. In general, members of the TGF superfamily can form either homodimers or heterodimers with other members of the family. For example, the GBB can form a heterodimer with DPP, which was shown to stimulate wing development in D. melanogaster (Shimmi et al. 2005) . Other TGF-\u03b2 superfamily members can heterodimerize, including BMP 4/7 (Yuan et al., 2013) , BMP 2/6 (Valera et al., 2010) and BMP 2/5, BMP 2/6 and BMP 2/7 (Israel et al., 1996) . BMP heterodimers have been demonstrated to be more effective than homodimers in the induction of certain effects. For instance, the BMP 2/6 heterodimer can induce the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells more efficiently than either BMP 2 or BMP 6 alone (Valera et al., 2010) . Furthermore, BMP 4 and BMP were demonstrated to play anti-apoptotic roles in granulosa cells by interacting with different signaling pathways (Shimizu et al., 2012) .",

                "text": "The effects of the FmGBB peptide on ecdysteroid production, which is involved in vitellogenesis, was investigated in this study. Interestingly, the results indicated that the level of hemolymph 20-HE was lower in shrimp injected with His-TF-rgbb than in shrimp injected with His-TF or buffer (Fig. 8a) . Additionally, the progression of the molting cycle in shrimp injected with His-TF-rgbb (D 1-2 ) was slower than that in shrimp injected with His-TF or buffer (D 3-4 ), which suggests an inhibitory effect of FmGBB on 20-HE production that resulted in delay of the molting cycle. During ecdysteroid biosynthesis, cholesterol is converted into ecdysone via the activity of ecdysteroidogenic enzymes, particularly those of the Halloween gene family (Mykles, 2011) . The secreted ecdysone is transported to the tissues, such as the ovaries, midgut and epidermis, where it is converted into 20-HE by CYP314A1 (Mykles, 2011; Petryk et al., 2003) . The reduction of 20-HE titers in hemolymph by FmGBB is clear, although it is unclear whether FmGBB negatively regulates ecdysteroidogenic enzymes in the Y-organs or the peripheral tissues. Furthermore, Vg expression was increased in the His-TFrgbb-injected shrimp (Fig. 8b) . It has been reported that the stimulation of gonad development occurs within the intermolt stages and is complete before progression to the premolt stage in several crustaceans, including L. vannamei, Macrobrachium rosenbergii and Emerita asiatica (Gunamalai and Subramoniam, 2002; Kang et al., 2014; Okumura and Aida, 2000; Raviv et al., 2006; Subramoniam, 2000) . The 20-HE level in hemolymph was observed to be at a low level (10-50 ng/ml) in the postmolt and early premolt stages, then was dramatically increased (220-230 ng/ml) in the premolt stage in P. monodon (Kuo and Lin, 1996) . Both the expression of Vg mRNA and Vg levels in hemolymph were shown to be increased in female L. vannamei during the intermolt stage (Kang et al., 2014) , and a high level of hemolymph Vg was found in freshwater prawn at the premolt stage (D 0-2 ) (Okumura and Aida, 2000) . In addition, a low level of 20-HE was shown to be essential for the normal progression of oogenesis in D. Melanogaster, while a higher level (approximately 200 nM) induced apoptosis (Terashima et al., 2005) , indicating that low levels of 20-HE in the intermolt and early premolt stages has the potential to stimulate Vg production. Similarly, Vg expression was stimulated by a low concentration of 20-HE (50 ng/ml; equivalent to ~100 nM) in primary ovarian cells (Fig. 9) .",

In crustaceans, 20-HE also induces vitellogenin expression both in vitro and in vivo. Vg expression was observed in ovarian explants derived from Metapenaeus ensis after treatment with 67-6700 nM 20-HE for 3 hr (Tiu et al., 2006) . Based on our results, a hypothesized model of the effects of FmGBB on Vg stimulation via the inhibiting 20-HE is depicted in Fig. 10 . Additionally, FmGBB can directly trigger oocyte proliferation. On the other hand, it is unclear whether His-TF-rgbb monomers can form heterodimers with other growth factors, particularly DPP, and subsequently trigger Vg expression. FmGBB also negatively controls 20-HE production to trigger ovarian development. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes need to be further elucidated in the future. Finally, our study showed that FmGBB is a factor that could potentially be utilized to stimulate gonad development and, thereby, eliminate the use of the traditional eyestalk ablation technique in shrimp aquaculture.",

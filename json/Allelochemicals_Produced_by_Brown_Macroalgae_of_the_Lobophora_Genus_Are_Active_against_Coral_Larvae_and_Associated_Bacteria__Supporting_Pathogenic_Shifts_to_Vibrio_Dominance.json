    "abstract": "Pervasive environmental stressors on coral reefs are attributed with shifting the competitive balance in favour of alternative dominants such as macroalgae. Previous studies have demonstrated that macroalgae compete with corals via a number of mechanisms, including the production of potent primary and secondary metabolites that can influence coral-associated microbial communities. The present study investigates the effect of the Pacific brown macroalga, Lobophora sp., on coral bacterial isolates, coral larvae, and the microbiome associated with the coral Porites cylindrica. Crude aqueous and organic macroalgal extracts were found to inhibit the growth of coral-associated bacteria, including known coral pathogens. Extracts and fractions were also shown to inhibit coral larval settlement and cause mortality at concentrations lower (< 0.3 mg mL-1) than calculated natural concentrations (4.4 mg mL-1). Microbial communities associated with coral tissues exposed to aqueous (e.g. hydrophilic) crude extracts demonstrated a significant shift to Vibrio-dominance and a loss of sequences related to the putative coral bacterial symbiont, Endozoicomonas sp., based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. This study contributes to growing evidence that macroalgal allelochemicals, dissolved organic material, and native macroalgal microbial assemblages all play a role in shifting the microbial equilibrium of the coral holobiont away from a beneficial state, contributing to a decline in coral fitness and a shift in ecosystem structure.",

                "text": "Coral reefs are complex ecosystems, providing diverse habitats for many marine organisms as well as contributing to the livelihoods of millions of people through food production, tourism, coastal protection from natural disasters and emerging biotechnology development (1) . However, coral reefs are in serious decline due to a combination of interacting natural and anthropogenic stressors, such as increased sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification (2) , eutrophication (3), disease (1, 4) and changes in trophic structure due to overfishing, disease, and poor management (5) . Imbalances in the natural ecosystem often cause a phase-shift, resulting in dominance of the reef by alternative species such as fleshy macroalgae (6) . Generally, the interactions between corals and algae are regarded as adverse to coral health, with no observed detriment to macroalgae (7) , whilst the severity of impact may depend on both the species involved and other synergistic stressors. For example, Vega-Thurber et al. (8) conducted a field experiment that examined competition between the coral Porites astreoides and five species of macroalgae; a significant coral-associated microbial shift was observed in response to Sargassum polyceratium and Galaxaura obtusata, highlighting the potential for species-specific competitive interactions. Although microbial dynamics were not examined, a comparative study by Bonaldo and Hay (9) found that direct contact between six corals and the two algal species, Chlorodesmis fastigiata (Chlorophyceae) and Galaxaura filamentosa (Rhodophyceae), on October 25, 2016 by CORNELL UNIVERSITY http://aem.asm.org/ Downloaded from caused visible damage to the majority of corals, whereas neither Sargassum polycystum (Phaeophyceae) or Turbinaria conoides (Phaeophyceae) had any effect. They also found that Porites cylindrica was the most resistant to macroalgal damage based on visual assessments (9) . Direct contact between macroalgae and corals has been implicated in reduced coral growth and fecundity, bleaching, tissue necrosis, mortality, and disease (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Macroalgae have also been shown to indirectly induce and inhibit coral larval settlement (16, 17) , both of which are likely to result in larval mortality via poor substratum choice (e.g. shading, overgrowth, ephemeral growth), mechanical damage (e.g. algal abrasion), or allelochemical defences. The species-specific impacts of macroalgae on corals continue to be investigated, however, the primary mechanisms of damage and microbial mediation are likely a combination of direct and indirect mechanisms related to physical abrasion (18) , nutrient enrichment through the release of dissolved organic material (19, 20) , and chemical toxicity (7, 21) . These mechanisms will vary on a species-by-species basis, likely mediated by algal morphology and growth characteristics as well as water flow and reef heterogeneity (22, 23) .",

                "text": "Coral holobionts are comprised of the coral animal, the plant symbiont Symbiodinium, and a diverse suite of bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists and viruses that work with the coral to assimilate nutrients, prevent disease, and maintain a healthy equilibrium (24) , reviewed in (25) . Each coral species maintains a specific assemblage of microorganisms that may be influenced by interactions with macroalgae (13, 20, 21) . Numerous studies have shown that shifts in microbial community composition can be detrimental to coral health and may predispose corals to bleaching, infection, and mortality (26, 27) . Barott and Rohwer (23) outline the DDAM model (Dissolved organic material [DOM] , Disease, Algae, and Microbes); a feedback loop in which DOM released from macroalgae disrupts coral holobiont function and promotes the invasion of opportunistic pathogens and coral mortality, facilitating additional macroalgal growth and invasion on the reef. Chemical cues and warfare are often enlisted by benthic marine invertebrates, including corals, interacting for space on the reef, having distinct impacts on community structure and function (28, 29) . Macroalgae are also known to produce potent secondary metabolites (i.e. allelochemicals), which are energetically costly to produce but thought to inhibit herbivory (reviewed in 30, 31) , and the growth of pathogenic and fouling microorganisms (reviewed in 32, 33) . Algal allelochemicals have been attributed to a on October 25, 2016 by CORNELL UNIVERSITY http://aem.asm.org/ Downloaded from physiological deterioration of coral tissues (7, 34) and to a significant increase in the enzyme glutathione S-transferase activity (GST), an antioxidant and detoxification enzyme (21) . Current evidence suggests that macroalgal allelochemicals and the native macroalgal microbial assemblages, in addition to release of macroalgae-derived DOM, all play a critical role in shifting the coral holobiont equilibrium. This shift not only contributes to a decline in coral fitness, but also ultimately influences coral reef ecosystem structure. Lobophora variegata have been shown to be chemically damaging to most corals (14) , and produce allelopathic activity against pathogenic and saprophytic marine fungi (36) . Hydrophilic (i.e. water soluble) compounds produced by L. variegata demonstrated antibacterial activity against 93% of coral reef bacterial isolates, whilst lipophilic compounds caused significant growth in 94% of the isolates tested (13) . Both aqueous and organic crude extracts from L. variegata were also shown to cause significant shifts in the microbial communities associated with two common Caribbean corals, Orbicella faveolata and Porites astreoides (21) . Both the live L. variegata and extracts derived therefrom caused shifts in coral mucus communities when directly in contact with coral tissues as well as > 5 cm away from contact zones, demonstrating the significant potential for natural concentrations of macroalgal exudates to alter holobiont stability in competing corals (21) . The current study further investigates whether a Lobophora sp. from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) has allelopathic activity against cultured coral-associated bacteria, in addition to examining the specific microbial community changes that occur when Lobophora sp.

Morphologically similar samples of Lobophora were collected from a single site on Humpy Reef, GBR, Australia (23\u00b012'98\": 150\u00b057'805\") in June 2013. Collections were carried out by SCUBA and placed in zip lock bags at depth. Samples were frozen (-20 \u2022 C) immediately after collection and transported to the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in Townville, Queensland. Samples were extracted as described in Morrow et al., (13) . Briefly, the macroalgae were lyophilized for several days prior to chemical extraction. Non-polar compounds were exhaustively extracted in triplicate from 91.7 g dry weight of Lobophora sp. with ethyl acetate: methanol (1:1) under sonication and the filtered extracts pooled (= organic crude extract; OC). The macroalga was further exhaustively extracted in ethanol: deionized water (1:1) three times, again with sonication, to separate the polar chemistry and the filtered extracts pooled (= aqueous crude extract; AC). The two crude extracts were dried by rotary evaporation (B\u00fcchi rotovapor R-200), lyophilised and the percentage extract per gram dry weight of algal tissue determined on a microbalance.",

Isolates were also inoculated into wells containing the carrier solvent (2.5% ethanol in \u00bd strength marine broth) to serve as a control for growth effects. Outer wells were filled with sterile Milli-Q water to maintain a constant humidity and to minimise evaporation during overnight incubations. Plate lids were coated with a mixture of 2.5% Triton-X (a non-ionic detergent) and 20% ethanol to prevent condensation and to allow accurate spectrometer readings without removing the lid. Optical density measurements (OD 595 nm) were taken at time 0 hrs and after 24 hrs of growth (Wallac Victor2 1420 Multi-label Counter, Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). Growth values were arctangent transformed to meet normality and homogeneity, and a one-way ANOVA with TukeyHSD pairwise comparisons was conducted using the vegan package (48) in R (R Core Team 2015) to examine whether growth/inhibition of each bacterium differed significantly between the control and treatment extracts. Four treatments were mounted on each treatment colony (T C ): two algal extracts (AE), a shading/abrasion control (P), and a solvent control (S, Fig. 1 ). The treatments were prepared as follows: the algal extract was dissolved in 5% ethanol and incorporated into a molten non-toxic Phyta-gel (Sigma-Aldrich), at which point the ethanol evaporated. The molten gel-extract was then poured into a mould fitted with plastic mesh to facilitate gel handling and left to set (7) . The moulded gel-extract was cut into 5 cm strips, encased inside translucent plastic tubing to reduce immediate dissolution of the aqueous compounds, and loosely secured with zip-ties around coral branches (AE; Fig. 1 ). Solvent controls were prepared with 5% ethanol and Phyta-gel without extract (S); abrasion/shading controls consisted of mesh and translucent plastic tubing without gel, solvent or extract (P). The controls were applied to both the T C and the MC C . The treatments were monitored over 24 hrs, at which time; a) five branches were collected from T C exposed to algal extracts -the branches exposed to two algal extract treatments (AE); one solvent control (S); one abrasion/shading control (P); and one no-treatment control (NT); b) three branches were collected from MC C not exposed to algal extracts -one solvent (S); one abrasion/shading (P), and one no-treatment branch (NT), and finally, c) two no-treatment branches (NT) were collected from NMC C not exposed to algal extracts or controls ( Fig. 1 ).",

The branch was then sprayed with pressurised air from a blow-gun attached to a SCUBA cylinder and fitted with a custom sterile tip (50) . The freed tissues were collected in CMFSW solution, pelleted at 20,000 x g for 10 min, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. A total of 48 samples of genomic DNA were sent to the Australian Centre for Ecogenomics (ACE, Brisbane, Australia) for Illumina tagged-pyrosequencing using the prokaryote-specific primers, 803F/1392R, which amplify the V5 to V8 hypervariable region and broadly target both Bacteria and Archaea (51) . The forward and reverse reads were trimmed using trimmomatic (52) to a minimum length of either 250 base pairs (bp) or where quality fell below 20 in a 4 bp sliding window. Reads of less than 190 bp were discarded. These paired reads were then stitched together into a single merged read using pandaseq (53) , which also removed the primer sequences. Fastx_toolkit's fastx_clipper script trimmed off any rogue adaptor sequences and converted the output to fasta format (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). Fasta files for each sample were then merged into a single combined sequence file using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) script add_qiime_labels.py (54) . A table of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) was generated using QIIME version 1.8.0 script pick_open_reference_otus.py against the May 2013 Greengenes database at 97% identity using default settings. The resulting table was sorted and low abundance clusters (less than 0.01%) were removed using QIIME's sort_otu_table.py and filter_otus_from_otu_table.py scripts, respectively. A taxa summary was created using QIIME's summarize_taxa_through_plots.py (54) . A second OTU table was generated using the copyRighter tool to improve the accuracy of microbial community profiles (55) . ",

At 2 mg mL -1 , growth of Paracoccus bacteria showed the greatest overall sensitivity to Lobophora extracts, as exposure to both crude extracts and the active AC f 4 resulted in >80% growth inhibition compared to the control (Fig. 2 ). Pseudovibrio and Bacterioplanes were both strongly inhibited by AC and AC f 4, but experienced a reduced effect in response to OC (Fig. 2) . The coral resident, Marinobacter sp., was the only bacterium to show significant growth in response to AC and OC extracts, but was still strongly inhibited by AC f 4 (Fig. 2) . The Shewanella sp. isolate was the only bacterium that showed no response, neither growth inhibition nor stimulation, in the presence on October 25, by CORNELL UNIVERSITY http://aem.asm.org/ Downloaded from of the extracts or fractions (Fig. 2) . Overall, there were significant differences in growth response between bacterial isolates (ANOVA, F = 53.28, P < 0.001), between extracts (F = 22.1, P < 0.001), and the interaction between bacteria and extracts (F = 14.88, P < 0.001; Fig. 2 ).

With only two time points, it was beyond our scope to determine whether Lobophora sp. extracts induced a single compositional shift to an alternate stable state in the P. cylindrica microbiome, or whether prolonged exposure would continue to destabilize the community, as demonstrated in (78) . However, the increase in alpha diversity and abundance of pathogen-associated taxa (e.g. Alteromonadales and Rhodobacterales; 79) detected in coral tissues indirectly exposed to algal extracts, suggests that algal compounds can cause a colony wide disturbance, as theorized based on microbial DGGE profiles in (69) . Prolonged exposure to these algal compounds would likely induce coral tissue loss and morbidity as a result of microbial destabilization and overgrowth by opportunists such as Vibrio spp., as has been discussed previously (20, 78) . It has been suggested that environmental stress, such as algal overgrowth, can facilitate a were shown here, and previously (13) , to have strong antibacterial properties against coral bacteria that can allow for the proliferation of opportunistic bacteria, particularly at the site of interaction. The microbiome within the surrounding tissues became more diverse and variable, which may be driven by a decline in the regulatory abilities of the host or its native microbial population (81) . In fact, thermal stress resulted in the coral pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus suppressing both coral innate immune pathways (82) and the antibiotic properties of coral mucus (83) . Thus, allelochemical stress caused by encroaching macroalgae may elicit a community-wide destabilization of the microbiome, shift to pathogen dominance, and ultimately coral disease and/or mortality.",

Although the shift was more pronounced on coral colonies exposed to Lobophora extracts, microbial diversity increased within 24 hrs in comparison to in situ controls (EC). Prior to any exposure to algal extracts, corals demonstrated a reduction in sequences related to Hahellaceae as well as the appearance of new taxa and a significant increase in several other members of the community. These results highlight the importance of using non-transplanted corals whenever possible to study microbial community changes, and to be cognisant of these changes when conducting aquaria studies. Although every precaution was taken to ensure that corals were exposed to natural reef-water in flow-through aquaria established within 1 km of the collection site, the removal of coral colonies from the environment and aquaria conditions still fostered a change in the coral-associated microbial community structure. Others have suggested that aquaria conditions might disrupt microbial interactions (84) , and computer models have shown that a small reduction in antibiotic production by holobiont members can allow opportunistic pathogens to dominate if conditions thereafter are favourable to these organisms (80) . Thus, the importance of rigorous on October 25, 2016 by CORNELL UNIVERSITY http://aem.asm.org/ Downloaded from environmental controls when conducting experimental studies with corals is highlighted in this study, since the coral microbiome is highly sensitive to manipulation and can quickly shift (e.g. by transplanting into aquaria) potentially causing a misinterpretation of results.",

Several studies have demonstrated that Lobophora macroalgae have the potential to negatively impact coral larval settlement success and survivorship (86, 87) . The corticated, foliose brown alga can form dense mats rendering the substratum inaccessible to coral recruits (85) , and in some instances serving as an impractical surface for settlement (88) . Waterborne chemicals from macroalgae have been shown to influence coral settlement (16, 89) , and in the present study, Acropora millepora larvae were negatively impacted by aqueous (AC) and organic (OC) extracts from Lobophora macroalgae collected on the GBR. The OC extract generally resulted in reduced mortality, in comparison to the more soluble AC extract, which was cytotoxic to > 60% of larvae at equivalent concentrations. Experiments with lyophilised and briefly rinsed algal blades caused ~50% mortality, but more rigorous washing of blades in seawater reduced mortality to 0%, suggesting that the cytotoxicity is likely due to water-soluble compounds.",

Macroalgae reduced survivorship and settlement success of the common Hawaiian coral Montipora capitata, though these negative effects were reversed and coral settlement increased with the addition of broad-spectrum antibiotics (90) . Corals also respond to positive settlement cues associated with CCA (56) , which may partly originate from microbial biofilms (90) (91) (92) (93) . Thus, macroalgal compounds may indirectly affect larval settlement success and survivorship by influencing microbial activity, thereby influencing oxygen concentrations (22) and biofilm composition on settlement surfaces (93) , which potentially make them less appealing for settlement (89) and/or reduce survivorship by weakening larval resistance to microbial infections and ultimately causing death (90) .

One branch from each colony was collected in situ (Environmental Colony; EC) into sterile whirl-paks (Nasco Co., Fort Atkinson, WI), representing the naturally occurring microbial community. The coral colonies were transported back to OIRS in containers of seawater, and placed into experimental raceways with unidirectional running seawater (pumped from offshore of OIRS) within one hour of collection. Five colonies were selected at random for treatment (T C ) with macroalgae; three colonies were selected to serve as manipulated control colonies (MC C ); the remaining two served as non-manipulated control colonies (NMC C ). The five control colonies (MC C and NMC C ) were positioned at the in-flow end of both raceways reducing potential contamination from experimental colonies downstream, as shown in Fig. 1.

Shannon diversity indices were calculated for each cluster in QIIME. A permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA, using 10,000 permutations) determined whether spatial separation between clusters was statistically significant. Finally, a similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) was also employed to investigate which OTUs contributed most to the dissimilarity between clusters. The raw pyrosequencing reads were submitted to the NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive) under accession #SRP072509. Larval settlement and survivorship assays A series of coral larval settlement assays were conducted with Acropora millepora larvae to assess whether Lobophora sp. extracts and fractions resulted in a higher occurrence of mortality, or induced/inhibited larval metamorphosis. Extracts and fractions were re-suspended in methanol to five final concentrations (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg mL -1 ) and poured into 6-well plates. The methanol was evaporated via vacuum centrifugation (Savant SpeedVac SC210A), and each well was filled with 10 mL of 0.2\u00b5m-filtered seawater, to which a 5 x 3 mm piece of autoclaved crustose coralline algae (CCA) was added as a positive settlement cue (see (56) for more details). Finally, sixday-old swimming A. millepora coral planulae (n = 10), reared at the AIMS National Sea Simulator in November 2013 (see (56) for details), were introduced to each well. Eight replicates of each treatment and three controls (with and without evaporated solvent), as well as an inert plastic settlement control, were prepared. The treatments included AC and OC extracts and AC fractions of Lobophora sp. The A. millepora planulae (n = 10 per well) were also exposed to 5 x 5 mm pieces of lyophilized Lobophora blades that were either: a) washed (W) in filtered seawater for 5 hrs or, b) not washed (NW), but briefly rinsed to reconstitute and then placed into experimental wells. Planulae were exposed to each treatment for 24 hrs in 6-well plates at 27\u02daC. After 24 hrs of treatment planulae were scored as dead, swimming, or metamorphosed. Dead was defined as planulae that were not moving or showed signs of degradation. Swimming was defined as planulae actively searching the water column and sides of the chamber.

                "text": "Marine macroalgae are a rich source of antifouling and antibacterial compounds (reviewed in(61), producing secondary metabolites that can prevent bacterial communication, swarming, and attachment to surfaces(62)(63)(64)(65)(66), and hence play an important and dynamic role in ecological interactions. Few studies have examined how algal-derived compounds, including secondary metabolites and other DOM, influence coral-associated microbial assemblages. Many coral reefs are experiencing phase-shifts to macroalgal dominance, and Lobophora sp. in particular has taken advantage of environmental stressors at some localized sites. For example at some locations in the Caribbean the lionfish invasion has resulted in Lobophora sp. cover increasing from 15% in 2001 to 92% in 2009(15). Direct contact with Lobophora macroalgae has already been shown to cause a negative physiological effect on corals in the form of tissue necrosis and bleaching(7,9,14,15,67,68). Previous studies have also shown that crude extracts from Caribbean L. variegata, particularly hydrophilic compounds, have broad-spectrum bacterial activity that causes significant shifts in coralassociated microbial communities(13,21). Thus, while most other studies have focused on lipophilic organic compounds from macroalgae, the current study builds on previous microbial community profiling data(21), and further indicates that aqueous compounds produced by Lobophora sp.have a potentially negative impact on the fitness of corals at different life stages, possibly through affecting coral-associated microbial assemblages. on October 25, 2016 by CORNELL UNIVERSITY http://aem.asm.org/ Downloaded from In the present study, Lobophora-derived extracts inhibited the growth of most bacterial strains isolated from corals, with the exception of Marinobacter sp., which displayed enhanced growth in the presence of both aqueous and organic extracts. Nearly all bacterial isolates, excluding Shewanella sp., were strongly inhibited by a partly purified fraction of the aqueous crude extract (AC f 4), suggesting that Lobophora macroalgae possess a suite of antibacterial compounds that differentially target marine bacteria. The 1 H NMR and HPLC analyses indicated that AC f 4 is a complex mixture of polar compounds (i.e. sugars and polyphenolics; Supplemental Fig. 1). These findings provide additional evidence that Lobophora found on both the GBR and in the Caribbean (13) have the potential to disrupt coral reef microbial communities through the production of broad-spectrum antibacterial compounds. The current study also demonstrates that Lobophora sp. produce hydrophilic compounds that have the potential to cause shifts in the native microbial community structure associated with Porites cylindrica corals after in situ exposure for 24 hrs in aquaria. A shift was demonstrated largely within the Gammaproteobacteria, from an environmental community dominated by members affiliated with the Hahellaceae (order Oceanospirillales), to a community dominated by members affiliated with the Vibrionaceae (order Vibrionales). This shift has important implications for coral fitness as members of the family Hahellaceae are known to form close associations with healthy corals (see below references). Members of the genus Endozoicomonas spp. (family Hahellaceae) are commonly found in association with corals and other marine invertebrates, often making up a significant proportion of the host microbiome. In particular, Endozoicomonas spp. are found to comprise 70-95% of the microbiome in several Red Sea (Stylophora pistillata, Pocillopora damicornis, and Acropora humilis) and Caribbean corals (Porites astreoides; 69-72). These bacteria have also been shown to live endosymbiotically, forming large aggregations deep within coral tissues (71), potentially playing a role in bacterial communication and structuring via the production of quorum-sensing signalling metabolites and antimicrobial compounds (73). Recently Endozoicomonas spp. specificity was shown to map onto the different reproductive strategies of the coral host, suggesting that symbiont selection may be linked to life history (74). When corals are under stress, the relative abundance of Endozoicomonas spp. has been shown to decline significantly. For example, when exposed to high on October 25, 2016 by CORNELL UNIVERSITY http://aem.asm.org/ Downloaded from pCO 2 /low pH conditions found in naturally occurring CO seeps in Papua New Guinea, the coral Acropora millepora demonstrated a 50% reduction in Endozoicomonas-related bacteria in comparison to ambient control sites",

The long-term survival of coral reefs depends on the recruitment of juvenile corals, therefore the impact of macroalgae on settlement success and survivorship is of critical importance. Overall, this study provides additional evidence of the potential for macroalgae to cause detrimental impacts on coral-associated microbial communities and early life stages. Due to shifting baselines in coral habitats, increasing macroalgal growth driven by anthropogenic disturbances may impact coral life history traits through the disruption of coral-associated microbial communities that play a critical role in holobiont health. Extracts and fractions derived from Lobophora macroalgae were shown to significantly deter growth of bacterial cultures derived from coral reefs as well as cause an equilibrium shift in the natural coral microbiome, leading to an increase in potential pathogens. It should be noted that the extent of this shift may have been exacerbated by transplantation of the experimental colonies into aquaria. Macroalgae have species-specific impacts on coral hosts and their associated bacteria, sometimes having the potential to alter pathways related to bacterial stress responses, pathogenesis and symbiosis, as well as carbohydrate metabolism (23). These shifts are likely to further destabilise coral health and contribute to phase shifts from coral to algal dominated reefs, which is correlated with a higher microbial load, referred to as microbialization (94). To better understand the ecological relevance of the observed interactions in the present study, future research should focus on: i) isolating the active compound(s) responsible for Lobophora's potent chemical activity, ii) determining whether they are intracellular or surface bound, iii) whether they are produced by the alga or bacterial associates of the alga and, iv) elucidating the mechanisms by which they are released into the surrounding environment i.e., through direct contact or dissolution into the water column. Future work would also benefit from examining both the aqueous-and organic-derived compounds, which will likely lead to new discoveries in natural products research, and advance our understanding of macroalgal competition on coral reefs, particularly as coral reefs are subjected to increasing human-derived environmental stressors. Additional metagenomic and metatranscriptomic research would also provide insight into the mechanistic role of certain dominant microbial members, helping to infer the consequences of shifting community structure. on October 25, 2016 by CORNELL UNIVERSITY http://aem.asm.org/ Downloaded from",

Here we show that Mtb lacking the stringent response enzyme Rel Mtb was unable to slow its replication rate during nutrient starvation. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the nutrient-starved rel Mtb-deficient strain had increased metabolism similar to that of exponentially growing wild-type bacteria in nutrient-rich broth, consistent with an inability to enter quiescence. Deficiency of rel Mtb increased the susceptibility of mutant bacteria to killing by isoniazid during nutrient starvation and in the lungs of chronically infected mice. We screened a pharmaceutical library of over 2 million compounds for inhibitors of Rel Mtb and showed that the lead compound X9 was able to directly kill nutrient-starved M. tuberculosis and enhanced the killing activity of isoniazid. Inhibition of Rel Mtb is a promising approach to target M. tuberculosis persisters, with the potential to shorten the duration of TB treatment.",

Binding of the alarmone (p)ppGpp changes the sigma factor specificity of the RNA polymerase, allowing the binding of alternative sigma factors, which have unique promoter recognition and activity (6) . Recent studies have highlighted additional molecular mechanisms by which (p)ppGpp mediates bacterial persistence (7) , including its role as a central regulator of multidrug tolerance through stochastic induction and by environmental stimuli in a process called responsive diversification (7, 8) .",

                "text": "Unlike members of the gand b-proteobacteria lineages, which encode two functionally divergent RSHhomologs (RelA and SpoT) (9) , Mtb encodes a single bifunctional RSH enzyme, Rel Mtb , which is conserved in all Mycobacterium species (10) . Rel Mtb contains two catalytic domains, a (p)ppGpp hydrolysis domain (1 to 181 amino acids) and a (p)ppGpp synthetase domain (87 to 394 amino acids), and a regulatory C-terminal domain (395 to 738 amino acids) (11) (12) (13) . The synthesis of ppGpp and pppGpp is catalyzed by the (p)ppGpp synthetase domain through transfer of the 5\u2032-b,g-pyrophosphate from adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) to the 3\u2032-OH of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) or guanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (GTP), respectively (11) . Crystallography studies showed that the Mtb (p)ppGpp synthetase domain comprises five b sheets surrounded by five a helices (13) , and mutational analysis revealed that amino acids D265 and E325 are required for (p)ppGpp synthesis in vitro (14) . The (p)ppGpp hydrolysis domain comprises 11 a helices, including a (p)ppGpp-binding pocket between the second and the third a helices (13) , and amino acids H80 and D81 are critical for hydrolase activity but dispensable for (p)ppGpp synthesis (12) . The function of each Rel Mtb catalytic domain is dependent on the concentration of cation cofactors, including Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ (10) . Although rel Mtb is constitutively expressed at basal levels, (p)ppGpp synthetase activity is repressed by the C-terminal domain in the absence of stresses (11, 15) , and (p)ppGpp accumulates in Mtb during NS and in response to hypoxia and oxidative stress (5, 16) . The preponderance of evidence suggests that the classic model of (p)ppGpp affecting RNA polymerase promoter open complexes to alter gene expression during the stringent response may be conserved in Mtb, but the underlying molecular mechanisms may differ from those of model organisms (10) .",

Poly(P) accumulation in bacteria is transient and requires stress-induced accumulation of (p)ppGpp (6, 22) . Mtb expresses two poly(P) kinases (PPK1/Rv2984 and PPK2/Rv3232c) and two exopolyphosphatases (PPX1/Rv0496 and PPX2/Rv1026) to regulate intracellular poly(P) homeostasis (22) . The increased expression of ppk1 leads to poly(P) accumulation, which drives synthesis of (p)ppGpp through induction of the mprAB-sigErel Mtb signaling pathway (23, 24) . Through a positive feedback mechanism, (p)ppGpp can inhibit the hydrolytic activity of Mtb PPX1 and PPX2 (25, 26) , leading to further accumulation of poly(P). Poly(P) accumulation contributes to Mtb antibiotic tolerance (25, 27, 28) and reduced bacterial survival in the lungs of guinea pigs (27) . Conversely, poly(P) deficiency enhances Mtb susceptibility to INH and fluoroquinolones and also results in defective growth and survival in guinea pig lungs (29) . Therefore, the tight regulation of the stringent response pathway is essential for the organism's ability to survive long term in host tissues and for tolerance to bactericidal drugs.",

Specifically, we studied the susceptibility of Drel to INH during NS in vitro, as well as to human-equivalent doses of INH during the chronic phase of infection in BALB/c mouse lungs, when wild-type Mtb exhibits tolerance to bactericidal drugs (30) . On the basis of our encouraging preliminary data, we sought to develop a small-molecule inhibitor targeting Rel Mtb . High-throughput screening (HTS) of a~2 million GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) compound library using a recombinant Rel Mtb enzyme yielded 178 candidate molecules with a preliminarily acceptable safety profile. As proof of concept, we tested 39 of these compounds in a whole-cell assay against nutrient-starved Mtb and Drel. One of these compounds, X9, was found to have Rel Mtb -specific inhibitory activity and synergy with INH against nutrient-starved Mtb, offering an attractive new strategy for eradicating Mtb antibiotictolerant persisters in conjunction with conventional TB treatment.",

We focused more on tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle remodeling because it is functionally associated with energy metabolism and lipid biosynthesis, which have been implicated as key cellular activities during Mtb adaptation to growth-limiting conditions (32, 33) . We observed that the WT strain adapted to NS by down-regulation of its TCA cycle activity, except for the alpha-ketoglutarate pool size (Fig. 2C) . Conversely, nutrient-starved Drel failed to remodel its TCA cycle intermediates, which mimicked the pattern observed for exponentially growing WT Mtb, as most of the TCA cycle intermediates (2-methylcitrate, citrate, succinate, fumarate, and malate) remained similar to those of WT Mtb in 7H9. The restoration of acetyl-P, citrate, and aconitate levels in nutrient-starved Drel was relatively minor as compared to other TCA cycle intermediates, including reductive branch intermediates (malate, fumarate, and oxaloacetate). Methylcitrate cycle (MCC) intermediates, such as 2-methylcitrate, were not restored but rather more abundant in nutrient-starved Drel, suggesting that Rel Mtb deficiency is associated with greater MCC activity during NS. Therefore, TCA cycle restoration in nutrient-starved Drel may be directly or indirectly associated with dysregulated MCC activities. We also observed that the nutrient-starved WT strain down-regulated its lipid metabolism, including biosynthesis or degradation of fatty acids with various chain lengths, resulting in decreased pool sizes of precursors of longer chain fatty acids that are potential products of fatty acid synthase (FAS) I and substrates for FAS II (Fig. 2,  B and D). The deficiency of Rel Mtb was associated with partial activation of lipid metabolism during NS, as shown in replicating WT Mtb. The metabolite profiles of WT Mtb and Drel during exponential growth in nutrient-rich broth and during NS affirmed our hypothesis that Rel Mtb serves as a metabolic sensor to monitor NS and initiate stringent adaptation.",

Since the enzymatic conversion of the substrate luciferin to light by luciferase is ATP dependent, this assay has been used to quantify intracellular ATP content (37) . As shown in Fig. 3A , at day 14 following NS of the WT and rel Mtb -complemented (rel Comp) strains, there was a significant decline in intrabacillary ATP levels from 18 mM to 6.3 \u00b1 0.6 mM and from 18 mM to 3.5 \u00b1 2.2 mM, respectively, compared to Drel, in which ATP levels remained relatively constant (18 mM to 18.8 \u00b1 3.2 mM; P < 0.01).

This heterogeneous method is time consuming, laborious, and difficult to adapt to an HTS environment. For this reason, we developed and optimized a homogeneous assay based on the quantification of adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (AMP) using fluorescence polarization (FP). The assay principle is competitive binding to an antibody between a fluorescently labeled AMP probe and the unlabeled AMP produced during the reaction catalyzed by Rel Mtb (Fig. 5A ). The anisotropy of the fluorescent probe increases as the rotational mobility of the molecule decreases by interaction with the specific anti-AMP antibody. As a consequence of Rel Mtb activity, AMP is synthesized from ATP and GTP in the presence of magnesium (II). The newly generated AMP displaces this interaction, proportionally decreasing the FP exerted by reaction mixtures.",

Afterward, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined in two independent experiments, the rel Mtb essentiality assay with H37Rv and the nonessentiality assay with the H37Rv Drel mutant. The range of MIC in the rel Mtb essentiality assay was from 1 to 125 mM and from 4 to >125 mM in the nonessentiality assay. Compounds with MIC ratios at least twofold greater against WT Mtb versus Drel were grouped into 18 structurally diverse classes. To carry out a preliminary exploration of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) patterns of these compounds, these hits were expanded through a series of analogs that were selected from the GSK compound library on the basis of similarity and substructure searches. Approximately 1000 compounds were tested in the biochemical Rel Mtb and HepG2 assays. Further phenotypic characterization was performed with a selection of the most promising compounds from each family. Ten families were discarded on the basis of cytotoxicity, low chemical tractability, lack of SAR, or absence of the desired phenotypic profile. The remaining eight families (GSK-A, GSK-B, GSK-C, GSK-D, GSK-H1, GSK-I, GSK-K, and GSK-M) lacked significant cyto-toxicity issues, and in four of these series, substantially more potent representatives were discovered ( fig.

The development and validation of the enzymatic assay has been the first critical step toward identifying candidate small molecules with promise for targeting the stringent response in a novel way by targeting the ability of Mtb to persist. Our strategy used three separate assays formats: a highly sensitive FP assay, a phenotype whole-cell assay based on temperature stress to gain knowledge of on-target effects, and cytotoxicity determinations to assess selectivity. After applying cluster analysis and chemical filtering, the identification of several compounds from the GSK compound library exemplifies the power of our screening strategy. Our compound screen yielded 39 Rel Mtb inhibitor candidates, 11 of which showed at least eightfold greater activity against WT Mtb than the rel Mtb -deficient mutant during NS. The lead candidate, X9, alone killed nutrient-starved Mtb and significantly reduced the tolerance of these bacilli to INH, phenocopying Drel under these conditions. Furthermore, X9 lacked activity against nutrient-starved Drel and, overexpression of Rel Mtb partially reversed its anti-TB activity against nutrientstarved Mtb, consistent with on-target activity of the compound.",

(45) postulated that bacterial persisters are not susceptible to aminoglycosides because of decreased proton-motive force, which is required for aminoglycoside uptake. The exposure of persistent bacteria to specific metabolic stimuli (e.g., mannitol and fructose) rendered them more susceptible to killing by aminoglycosides, which target protein translation, an essential process during bacterial persistence. On the other hand, these metabolic stimuli did not promote killing of persisters by antibiotics with distinct mechanisms of action, such as quinolones or b-lactams. Previous studies have attempted to target the bacterial stringent response in other organisms. Wexselblatt et al. (46) synthesized a group of (p)ppGpp analogs and tested these as competitive inhibitors of Rel proteins in vitro. The same group developed a novel compound, Relacin, designed to inhibit RelA-mediated synthesis of (p)ppGpp, leading to a marked reduction in viability and spore formation of Bacillus anthracis (47) . Subsequently, SAR studies permitted the development of deoxyguanosine-based analogs of Relacin with improved potency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (48) .

Nutrient-starved Drel showed an unabated bacterial division rate as measured by loss of the replication clock plasmid, and the mean number of nutrient-starved Drel increased slightly, while that of the nutrient-starved WT strain remained stable. Primm et al. (5) found that Drel was relatively stable after 7 days of NS but declined b\u1ef9 log 10 CFU/ml after~120 days of NS. The modest increase in the bacterial density of nutrient-starved Drel after 7 days in our studies may be attributable to carryover of nutrients, since cultures grown in nutrient-rich broth were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) rather than pelleted and resuspended in the latter to prevent clumping over the 21-day observation period. Together, these data suggest that, although the mutant bacteria may be able to multiply for a limited number of cycles by scavenging scarce nutrients and using intracellular nutrient stores, eventually, the nutrient supply is depleted and the total number of viable bacteria declines as they futilely attempt to continue to divide. Assuming that mutant progeny bacteria carrying the plasmid and those lacking the plasmid die at equal rates, the net effect is a declining total number of mutant bacteria over time and a lower proportion of surviving bacteria carrying the plasmid (which is lost with each round of cell division). An alternative explanation is that there is differential stability of plasmid versus bacterial chromosomal DNA during stress exposure, although this has not been described previously in mouse lungs (31) or in macrophages (52) , and there is no reason to suspect that plasmid DNA is more unstable in Drel than in WT Mtb.",

These phenotypes are largely consistent with the available literature. The accumulation of (p)ppGpp in bacteria is known to alter the intracellular ATP:GTP ratio (10) , and Gengenbacher et al.

Singh et al. found that the deletion of rel Mtb causes mid-and late-log phase cultures of Mtb to accumulate less poly(P) (29) , and our data suggest that the stringent response is also required for the transient accumulation of poly(P) during Mtb adaptation to NS. Unlike the metabolomics profile associated with Mtb poly(P) accumulation in a ppx2/rv1026 knockdown mutant in nutrient-rich conditions (25), we found that poly(P) accumulation in nutrient-starved WT Mtb was associated with down-regulated reductive branch TCA cycle intermediates (succinate, fumarate, and malate) with reciprocal up-regulation of oxidative TCA cycle intermediates (alpha-ketoglutarate) (Fig. 2C) . Recent 13 C isotope metabolomics profiling of hypoxic Mtb (33) provides a possible explanation for the differences in TCA cycle remodeling observed between nutrient-starved WT Mtb and the ppx2 knockdown mutant grown in nutrient-rich conditions, both of which show activation of the stringent response, as manifested by poly(P) accumulation and antibiotic tolerance. This analysis showed that the induction of reductive TCA cycle intermediates in hypoxic Mtb is significantly attributable to the 13 C-labeled fraction, suggesting that hypoxic Mtb biosynthesizes reductive TCA cycle intermediates partly by using carbon substrates supplied in the media. Thus, during NS, Mtb lacks the carbon substrates to be used for the biosynthesis of the reductive branch TCA cycle intermediates, resulting in reduction of these intermediates. Nutrient-starved Mtb maintained high levels of alpha-ketoglutarate, which was not observed in the metabolic remodeling of hypoxic Mtb and which was kinetically matched to catabolic remodeling of glutamine. Activities required for glutamine degradation and alpha-ketoglutarate biosynthesis warrant further investigation as another metabolic strategy of Mtb adaptation to nutrient-limited environments.",

These findings may be explained by the potent antitubercular activity of these drugs against actively dividing Mtb, in which the stringent response is not activated. In contrast, during Mtb growth restriction, such as following exposure to NS, the organism exhibits antibiotic tolerance, manifested by a >100-fold increase in the MBC of INH (53) . We found that this antibiotic tolerance was completely reversed in the absence of a stringent response, as the MBC of INH against nutrient-starved Drel was identical to that against actively dividing WT Mtb in nutrient-rich broth. Our data are consistent with previous studies linking the stringent response with antibiotic tolerance in Mtb. Thus, exopolyphosphatase deficiency and poly(P) accumulation in Mtb, which lead to increased (p)ppGpp levels through the MprAB-SigE-Rel Mtb feedback loop (22, 23) , result in reduced susceptibility to INH (25, 27, 28) . Conversely, reduced poly(P) levels due to deficiency of PPK1 was associated with increased susceptibility to INH (29) .",

First, it is important to address whether the phenotypes of Drel described here are directly attributable to (p)ppGpp deficiency and/or poly(P) deficiency. Currently, we are unaware of reliable and reproducible methods to directly measure (p)ppGpp in Mtb. However, these phenotypes may be studied following site-directed mutagenesis of the (p)ppGpp synthetase and hydrolysis domains, as well as in poly(P)-deficient mutants (e.g., Dppk1 and recombinant knock-in strains of ppx1/rv0496 or ppx2/rv1026). Furthermore, the current studies used a rel Mtb deletion strain, which was incapable of inducing the stringent response during Mtb adaptation to NS. Future studies will focus on the generation and characterization of a conditional rel Mtb knockdown strain to determine whether down-regulation of the strin-gent response after Mtb adaptation to NS (and during chronic infection in animal lungs) leads to reduced bacterial viability and antibiotic tolerance. Although the lead compound X9 appears to inhibit the (p)ppGpp synthetase activity of Rel Mtb based on the enzymatic assays used for the HTS, it is unknown whether the compound binds to amino acid D265 and/or E325, both of which are required for (p)ppGpp synthesis. Future crystallographic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the recombinant enzyme will attempt to characterize the nature and location of X9 binding to Rel Mtb . Last, studies focused on the SAR of X9 and other Rel Mtb candidate inhibitors will guide the selection of a lead compound for pharmacokinetics and efficacy studies in animal models.",

The strains used for animal infections were twice-passaged, once through the guinea pig and once through the mouse.

The rel Mtb knock-in and empty vector strains were generated in WT CDC1551 Mtb strain using a conditional expression plasmid, pUV15tetORm, which was obtained from Addgene (plasmid no. 17975) (54) . To generate the rel Mtb knock-in strain, the segment containing the rel Mtb gene, including 2441 base pairs downstream, was cloned using Pac I and Acl I, the sense orientation under control of the tetracycline operator (TetO) responsive mycobacterial promoter (pUVatt relA knock-in). The segment containing attB and Int from pMH94 was cloned into puv15tetORm using the Mfe I and Acl I restriction sites to generate a single-copy plasmid conferring hygromycin resistance (55, 56) . For generation of the empty vector, the segment containing rel Mtb was replaced by the segment containing attB and Int from pMH94 using the Mfe I and Pac I sites (pUVatt empty vector). The integrating plasmids pUVatt rel Mtb knock-in and pUVatt empty vector were introduced into the WT CDC1551 Mtb strain by electroporation, and transformants were selected on hygromycin-containing 7H10 plates. Plasmid insertion was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",

Sherman, (31) ], which is slightly defective in replication in the absence of selection. The loss of this plasmid in nonselective media allows a direct measurement of cell division as a function of the ratio of cells containing the plasmid divided by the total number of cells. The rel Comp strain was not used in this assay because of a conflict with the selectable markers. Cells were maintained in media containing kanamycin (30 mg/ml) to prevent plasmid loss. To prevent clumping, which would affect the accuracy of the bacterial counts for these studies, cultures of WT and Drel strains grown in supplemented Middlebrook 7H9 broth were not centrifuged or washed with PBS to remove remaining nutrients. Instead, they were directly diluted either into PBS containing 0.05% tyloxapol (to assess bacterial growth and survival in NS conditions) or 7H9 media + OADC + 0.05% tyloxapol (to assess bacterial growth in nutrient-rich conditions), each lacking kanamycin. Since Tween 80 is relatively unstable and more likely to break down to oleic acid, which can serve as a fatty acid carbon source for the growth of mycobacteria (57) , the more stable detergent tyloxapol, which is not readily metabolized by mycobacteria, was used to prevent clumping in these studies. However, it is estimated that a volume of 1 to 2% of 7H9 broth was transferred during the dilution of cultures into PBS, thus introducing some nutrients into the latter.",

In the Rel Mtb essentiality assay, the H37Rv inoculum was standardized to 1.5 \u00d7 10 CFU/ml in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco), 0.1% glucose, 10% AS (0.5% albumin in 15mM NaCl), and 0.05% Tween 80 in a 96-well format and incubated for 10 days at 39\u00b0C. This inoculum (100 ml) was added to the entire plate, except for column 11, which was used as controls for inhibition. The wells in column 11 were filled with Drel mutant in the same conditions. In the Rel Mtb nonessentiality assay, the H37Rv Drel mutant inoculum was standardized to 10 CFU/ml in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco), 0.1% glucose, 10% AS (0.5% albumin in 15mM NaCl), and 0.05% Tween in a 96-well format and incubated for 7 days at 37\u00b0C. Resazurin measurements were done 48 hours after addition of 25 ml of dye solution. Fluorescence was measured using a Fluostar Optima fluorescence plate reader (BMG Labtech) equipped with a 544-nm excitation filter and a 590-nm emission filter.",

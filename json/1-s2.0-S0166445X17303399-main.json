    "abstract": "Heavy metals have become one of the main pollutants in the marine environment and a major threat to the growth and reproduction of stony corals. In the present study, the density of symbiotic zooxanthellae, levels of crucial physiological activities and the transcriptome were investigated in the stony coral Pocillopora damicornis after the acute exposure to elevated cadmium concentration. The density of symbiotic zooxanthellae decreased significantly during 12-24 h period, and reached lowest at 24 h after acute cadmium stress. No significant changes were observed in the activity of glutathione S-transferase during the entire stress exposure. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and the concentration of glutathione decreased significantly, but the activation level of caspase3 increased significantly after cadmium exposure. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis revealed 3538 significantly upregulated genes and 8048 significantly downregulated genes at 12 h after the treatment. There were 12 overrepresented GO terms for significantly upregulated genes, mostly related to unfolded protein response, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. In addition, a total of 32 GO terms were overrepresented for significantly downregulated genes, and mainly correlated with macromolecular metabolic processes. These results collectively suggest that acute cadmium stress could induce apoptosis by repressing the production of the antioxidants, elevating oxidative stress and activating the unfolded protein response. This cascade of reactions would result to the collapse of the coral-zooxanthella symbiosis and the expulsion of symbiotic zooxanthellae in the stony coral P. damicornis, ultimately leading to coral bleaching.",

                "text": "Stony corals are unique creatures living in shallow waters with relatively low nutrient levels and good illumination conditions (Zhang et al., 2015) . They compose most of the great reef ecosystems in tropical seas, and heavily depend on symbiotic relationships with zooxanthellae, specifically with the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium (Tong et al., 2017) . The zooxanthella lives within the intracellular vacuoles of the gastrodermal (endodermal) tissue, and provides the coral with nutrients through photosynthesis, a crucial energy source in an otherwise clear and nutrient-poor tropical waters (Ganot et al., 2011) . In exchange, the coral provides the zooxanthellae with the carbon dioxide and ammonium needed for photosynthesis (Shinzato et al., 2011) . However, owing to this distinct symbiosis, stony corals are more sensitive to changes in the marine environment, and exhibit systemic responses to environmental stress (Parkinson and Baums, 2014) . Because of climate change and environmental pollution, stony corals have been subjected to frequent and severe diseases over the past decades (Vidal-Dupiol et al., 2011) .",

During warming periods for example, stony corals undergo \"bleaching\" as a form of morphological and physiological response (Coles and Brown, 2003) , a process where the host corals either lose their symbiotic zooxanthellae, or the zooxanthellae's photosynthetic pigments degrade. The resulting collapse of the symbiosis between the coral and zooxanthellae causes decreased coral adaptation and increased mortality (Goreau and Macfarlane, 1990) . Studies suggested that oxidative damage due to an excess of respiratory burst and reactive oxygen species (ROS) could induce apoptosis, cell death and tissue abscission of stony coral, and finally result to coral bleaching (Downs et al., 2002; Lesser, 1997) .",

                "text": "Heavy metals are one of the main marine pollutants mainly coming from industrial discharges, urban/agricultural run-off and anti-fouling paints. Its distribution and effects on coral reefs have recently received considerable attention (Hudspith et al., 2017; Morton and Blackmore, 2001) . Heavy metal intoxications have been observed in the majority of coral reefs worldwide (Chen et al., 2010; Guzm\u00e1n and Jim\u00e9nez, 1992; Haynes and Johnson, 2000; Horwitz et al., 2014) . Stony corals are able to absorb heavy metals from the environment, and accumulate them in their tissues and skeleton through mineralization (Barakat et al., 2015; Darvishnia et al., 2016; Esslemont et al., 2000; Harland et al., 2009) . While some trace heavy metals such as strontium are essential to the growth and reproduction of stony corals (Meibom et al., 2003) , high levels of other heavy metals such as copper, cadmium, lead, zinc and nickel have been reported to effect fertilization success, glutathione (GSH) levels, tissue integrity, bleaching and death of some stony coral species (Mitchelmore et al., 2003; Mitchelmore et al., 2007; Harrison, 1999, 2005; Sabdono, 2009) . However, despite the high threat to heavy metal intoxication in most coastal environments, the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of heavy metals on stony coral remains little understood.",

Coral bleaching is characterized by the collapse of coral-zooxanthella symbiosis and the decrease in symbiotic zooxanthellae (Ganot et al., 2011) . In the present study, the systemic responses of stony corals towards acute cadmium stress, focusing on P. damicornis, were investigated to reveal its adaptation mechanisms. The change in the density of symbiotic zooxanthellae was determined first to understand the balance of coral-zooxanthella symbiosis after cadmium stress. Results showed that it decreased significantly during 12-24 h period after exposure to elevated cadmium, and reached the lowest level after 24 h. This demonstrates that an acute stress from cadmium (20 \u03bcg L \u22121 ) could induce a significant decrease of symbiotic zooxanthellae in the stony coral P. damicornis. This however was inconsistent with previous observations, which reported that the density of symbiotic zooxanthellae did not change significantly after cadmium stress (Mitchelmore et al., 2007) . The disparity in the observations could have resulted from the differences in cadmium concentrations used and the sampling time, since the insignificant change was observed between 4 and 14 days after exposure to cadmium (5 \u03bcg L \u22121 ). The present results demonstrated that acute cadmium stress could lead to the collapse of coralzooxanthella symbiosis and the expulsion of symbiotic zooxanthellae. The reason for the collapse after cadmium stress might be similar to the response after heat stress, attributed to the changes in the internal environment of the stony coral, such as the increase of ROS level (Lesser, 1997) , the activation of apoptosis (Tchernov et al., 2011) , and so on. The continued decrease of symbiotic zooxanthellae after acute cadmium stress could lead to coral bleaching, and even death, which could be the same thing happening in the stony coral P. damicornis.",

The temporal variation in GST activity was determined upon exposure to cadmium, which was the phase II metabolic enzymes in the detoxification process of all eukaryotes (Nicosia et al., 2014) . We observed that the GST activity did not change significantly before and after exposure to the heavy metal, demonstrating that acute cadmium stress (20 \u03bcg L \u22121 ) could not trigger the detoxification system in the stony coral P. damicornis. Several studies reported that cnidarians were able to accumulate heavy metal in tissues and skeletons, especially cadmium (Metian et al., 2015; Mohammed and Dar, 2010) . The ability to bioaccumulate allows the cnidarians to tolerate high levels of cadmium. For example, the 96 h LC and 6 h EC 50 reached as high as 946 and 355 \u03bcg L \u22121 for cadmium in the anemone Aiptasia pulchella, a usual cnidarian model for ecotoxicological studies in tropical marine environments (Howe et al., 2014) . Similarly, tolerance against heavy metals could have accounted for the insignificant change of GST activity in the detoxification system of the stony coral P. damicornis. This then suggests that although cadmium did not directly affect the physiology of the coral, its accumulation however decreased the symbiotic zooxanthellae, which could result to bleaching and then to death in the stony coral P. damicornis.",

This suggests that the high cadmium level (20 \u03bcg L \u22121 ) could suppress the antioxidant abilities of the stony coral P. damicornis.

The significant decreases of SOD and CAT activities in the present study could have been a result of the change in their expression or structure under cadmium stress. Previous studies reported that cadmium could change the conformation of SOD protein to decrease its enzyme activity, and cause oxidative stress-induced neural cell apoptosis (Huang et al., 2006) . It was also reported that cadmium stress induced the expression level of CAT mRNA, but suppressed its activity and decreased its protein content in Pisum sativum (Romero-Puertas et al., 2007) . Furthermore, the significant decline of GSH concentration supports the hypothesis that the antioxidant ability was suppressed by acute cadmium stress in the stony coral P. damicornis. Environmental stressors generally induce ROS levels in the internal environment of the organism: therefore, the decline of antioxidant production implied that the oxidative stress would become stronger under cadmium stress. This could even trigger apoptosis, collapse in the symbiosis, and bleaching of the stony coral (Baird et al., 2009; Lesser, 1997) .",

Consequently, we surveyed the activation level of caspase3 to understand the apoptosis status of the stony coral P. damicornis after acute cadmium stress. The activation level of caspase3 increased significantly after 24 h exposure to cadmium stress, demonstrating that cadmium also induced apoptosis in the stony coral P. damicornis. Apoptosis was also observed when the same stony coral P. damicornis suffered from heat and ammonium stresses (Tchernov et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2017) . Specifically, heat stress could induce apoptosis through TNF signal pathway and caspase3 in the stony coral (Quistad et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017) . In the present study, apoptosis was induced after cadmium stress because of the upregulated oxidative stressors in the internal environment through the repression of antioxidant production. An example of this is the accumulation of nitric oxide, which then induced apoptosis through caspase3 also in the stony coral P. damicornis (Hawkins et al., 2014) . Apoptosis would ultimately result to the collapse of the symbiotic balance between coral and zooxanthellae, and lead to the expulsion of symbiotic zooxanthellae causing bleaching.",

The unfolded protein response was also observed in two species of Acropora after heat stress (Ruiz-Jones and Palumbi, 2017; Traylor-Knowles et al., 2017) . In this study, the said response could account for the upward oxidative stress in the body of the organisms by repressing production of antioxidants, since ROS is known to induce the emergence of unfolded or misfolded proteins (Runkel et al., 2013) . These unfolded or misfolded proteins would accumulate in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and activate the unfolded protein response. If these proteins are not repaired within a certain time span or the disruption is prolonged, the unfolded protein response would lead to apoptosis (Erguler et al., 2013) . These studies corroborate our observation on the physiological activities during stressful conditions in the stony coral P. damicornis. On the other hand, the 32 overrepresented GO terms for significantly downregulated genes correlated well with the metabolic processes involving macromolecules, especially for nucleic acid. This further demonstrated that gene expressions could be regulated positively during acute cadmium stress, and mRNA transcription in the stony coral P. damicornis would be remodeled under elevated cadmium to maintain homeostasis and improve adaptability",

    "abstract": "Most associations between animals and their gut microbiota are dynamic, involving sustained transfer of food-associated microbial cells into the gut and shedding of microorganisms into the external environment with feces, but the interacting effects of host and microbial factors on the composition of the internal and external microbial communities are poorly understood. This study on laboratory cultures of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster reared in continuous contact with their food revealed timedependent changes of the microbial communities in the food that were strongly influenced by the presence and abundance of Drosophila. When germfree Drosophila eggs were aseptically added to nonsterile food, the microbiota in the food and flies converged to a composition dramatically different from that in fly-free food, showing that Drosophila has microbiota-independent effects on the food microbiota. The microbiota in both the flies that developed from unmanipulated eggs (bearing microorganisms) and the associated food was dominated by the bacteria most abundant on the eggs, demonstrating effective vertical transmission via surface contamination of eggs. Food coinoculated with a four-species defined bacterial community of Acetobacter and Lactobacillus species revealed the progressive elimination of Lactobacillus from the food bearing few or no Drosophila, indicating the presence of antagonistic interactions between Acetobacter and Lactobacillus. Drosophila at high densities ameliorated the Acetobacter/Lactobacillus antagonism, enabling Lactobacillus to persist. This study with Drosophila demonstrates how animals can have major, coordinated effects on the composition of microbial communities in the gut and immediate environment.",

The capacity of various microorganisms to exploit the animal habitat involves multiple traits, including mechanisms that evade or modulate the animal immune system (1) (2) (3) and metabolic adaptations to utilize host resources (4, 5) . Animal-associated microorganisms include pathogens, whose fitness is coupled to host disease and debility, and beneficial forms that variously contribute nutrients, confer protection, and deliver effectors that promote host performance (6) .

Open symbioses can be invaded by external microorganisms that are compatible with the host and are competitive with resident microbiota. As a result, the host is potentially more exposed to parasites and cheats than in a closed system but also has an enhanced capacity to modify the composition of its microbiota adaptively to changes in environmental circumstances (8, 9) . The shedding of microbial cells from hosts can alter the composition and functional traits of the microbial communities in the immediate environment, provide a source of compatible microbial inocula for other host individuals, including progeny, and promote dispersal of animal-associated microorganisms (10) (11) (12) (13) . These multiple studies indicate that the microbial communities in the external environment can both influence, and be influenced by, the microbiota in animals, but the scale of these reciprocal effects is largely unknown.",

Taxonomy assignment of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) clustered at 97% identity was conducted based on phylum-to-genus identities obtained by using the RDP classifier in QIIME trained on the Greengene reference database (May 2013), with additional information on species identities of the OTUs derived from NCBI StandAlone BLAST (the megaBLAST program is available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/html/megablast.html), using the 16S rRNA gene microbial database (March 2015), which also provides the percent sequence identity to the top hit, confidence bit score, and E value. Supplementary manual curation was applied that removed a single OTU annotated as chloroplasts and to correct species identities of a few OTUs guided by data obtained from full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences in previous studies (see footnotes for Table S1 in the supplemental material). OTUs with fewer reads than in the reagent-only control were excluded. To minimize inflation of diversity due to sequencing errors, the presence of artifactual OTUs that can be explained by sequencing errors was assessed by a modified version of the Poisson probability method used previously (26) . Briefly, the Poisson probabilities (PPois) for the occurrence of a single artifactual read at different sequence percent identities were calculated for each biological sample, based on a sequencing error rate of 1.07% (27) . The probability of a minor OTU arising from sequencing errors was determined by normalizing the PPois to the power of the read number of that OTU in a given biological sample (PPois read number of the OTU in the sample). OTUs classified as artifacts were pooled with major OTUs with the same BLAST top hit. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots of the bacterial communities were created with jackknifing (rarified to the lowest number of sequences) to avoid bias due to uneven read numbers across samples.The pyrosequence reads have been submitted to the NCBI Short Read Archive under accession number SRP049034.",

We also assayed unmanipulated eggs on day 0 and environmental samples and the Drosophila flies at 5 to 6 days posteclosion, i.e., on day 16.",

As illustrated in the weighted principal coordinates plot (Fig. 1C) , the microbiota in flies from the unmanipulated eggs generally resembled the egg microbiota. Although these flies also possessed some OTUs also present in the fly-free food on day 0 (99/244 OTUs), the environment (4/244 OTUs), or both (19/244 OTUs), these taxa collectively accounted for \u03fd6% of the total reads in the fly samples. Overall, the mean weighted UniFrac distance between the bacterial communities in these flies and the eggs was 0.09, and that between the flies and food on day 0 was 0.32 (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). These findings indicate that the microbiota of Drosophila is derived predominantly from the microbiota associated with eggs in our laboratory system. Reinforcing this conclusion, we have consistently failed to isolate Acetobacter from food vials that have not been exposed to Drosophila (unpublished data). Furthermore, the bacterial communities in the food bearing these flies shifted, between day 0 and day 16, to closely match the bacterial composition in the flies (UniFrac distance 0.02 to 0.03) (see Table S3 ).",

The Drosophila reared from dechorionated eggs bore a microbiota of higher diversity than those from unmanipulated eggs (see Table S2 in the supplemental material) that included various bacterial taxa, e.g., Actinobacteria, Sphingomonas, and Burkholderia (Fig. 1) , of low abundance in the fly-free food. Furthermore, the microbiota in the food differed between the Drosophila-free vials and the vials bearing Drosophila flies from dechorionated eggs. Specifically, the relative abundance of reads assigned to Bacilli in the food at day 0 (52 to 73% abundance) was sustained with the no-egg treatment at day 16, but much diminished (6% and 26%) in the presence of Drosophila flies from dechorionated eggs, being replaced by bacterial communities similar to that in the flies (Fig. 1B) . Overall, the composition of the food microbiota at day 16 containing flies raised from dechorionated eggs was similar to that of the flies in these vials, whereas the bacterial communities in the Drosophilafree vials underwent little change (the UniFrac distance between the food on day 0 and day 16 was 0.29 and 0.33 in vials administered dechorionated eggs and 0.13 and 0.16 in the Drosophila-free vials).",

As a definitive test of this hypothesis, we quantified the effect of egg number (0, 10, 30, and 60 sterile eggs in 10 replicate vials) on the bacterial complement of the food. Fly survivorship did not vary with egg density, with all treatments yielding ca. 70% live flies from the eggs (Kruskall Wallis analysis, H2 \u03ed 0.23, P \u03ed 0.89) (Fig.  2B) .

For the Acetobacter-free treatments, Lactobacillus was recovered from all vials, with a 10fold-greater mean density in vials with Drosophila (1.23 \u03eb 10 4 CFU mg of food \u03ea1 ) than without Drosophila (1.0 \u03eb 10 3 CFU mg of food \u03ea1 ) (mean values back-transformed from logarithmic values in Fig. 2C ), and this effect was statistically significant (log-transformed data: t 18 \u03ed 2.24, P \u03fd 0.05).

The nature of the microbiota-independent effects of Drosophila on the bacterial populations in the food remains to be determined but may include changes to the physical structure of the food by feeding activity and larval tunneling, or alterations to the chemical constitution of the food by release of enzymes and other bioactive compounds in regurgitant, saliva, and fecal material. Our study additionally shows that alternative Drosophila-dependent bacterial communities can be assembled on a single diet formulation (Fig. 1 ), confirming evidence from other studies that Drosophila can associate with many different bacteria (16, 21, 28) . These conclusions should, however, be tempered by the widelyrecognized limitations of amplicon analysis of microbial communities, including variation in the extraction and amplification efficiencies of different bacterial taxa, the inability of this method to discriminate between DNA from live and dead bacterial cells, and the artifactual inclusion of contaminating sequences, especially from reagents (29) (30) (31) . In our experiments, we made every attempt to minimize the limitations brought by these caveats, including the use of an optimized DNA extraction protocol and correction for sequences recovered from reagent-only controls (see Materials and Methods).",

One significant factor is the compatibility of the bacteria with both the Drosophila gut and the food; this factor likely contributes to the variation in the gut microbiota composition with diet in Drosophila (16, 17) and other animals with open symbioses (32) (33) (34) . Bacteria-bacteria interactions are also important, as illustrated by the replacement of the bacterial communities in fly-free food by bacteria of the genus Acetobacter introduced with the Drosophila eggs ( Fig. 1 ) and the suppression of Lactobacillus by Acetobacter in food bearing few or no Drosophila (Fig. 2) . However, Drosophila can influence the outcome of these among-bacterial interactions, as illustrated by the recovery of Lactobacillus in vials coinoculated with Acetobacter at high densities of Drosophila. The basis of the density-dependent suppression by Drosophila of the negative effect of the Acetobacter/Lactobacillus antagonism on Lactobacillus abundance may be multifaceted. For example, Drosophila feces or other products may provide nutrients utilizable by Lactobacillus but not Acetobacter, and the feeding activity and movement of Drosophila may disrupt the otherwise-coherent biofilm formed by Acetobacter on the surface of the food (unpublished observations), potentially reducing Acetobacter competitiveness.",

                "text": "The relationship between the bacterial populations in the Dro-sophila gut and the food cannot be understood fully without considering the costs and benefits of the association with the animal and microbial partners. The natural diet of Drosophila is rotting fruit and the microorganisms (yeasts and bacteria) that contribute to fruit degradation. Available evidence suggests that Drosophila benefits from the relationship by gaining access to nutrients, especially amino-N, lipids, and B vitamins, from the microorganisms (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) . This study reveals that the association can be costly to the bacterial partner. Specifically, the total abundance of Acetobacter in vials bearing Drosophila was depressed relative to that in fly-free vials ( Fig. 2A) . Potentially outweighing this cost is the likely benefit to the microbiota of host-mediated dispersal, achieved by the voiding of viable microbial cells in the feces (14, 15, 19, 40) . The magnitude of the costs and benefits to the bacteria of associating with Drosophila is expected to vary with conditions and traits of the different bacteria. For example, bacteria with relatively long retention times in the Drosophila gut are likely to be more favored in wild Drosophila populations than in laboratory cultures, where the continual access of flies to food is predicted to result in relaxed selection on the bacteria to persist for extended periods in the gut. The crucial outstanding question is the extent of coevolutionary interactions between the partners in open systems, as exemplified by the relationship between Drosophila and its gut microbiota. For example, the digestive and immunological functions of the insect gut may be calibrated for bacterial survival and shedding rates that optimize dispersal of beneficial microorganisms to microsites utilized by the insect host and its progeny, while the living cells of beneficial microorganisms may display adaptations that promote the release of nutrients valuable to the host (B vitamins and amino-N) and mediate putrefaction of fruit at rates appropriate to preadult development rates of the insect. The apparent absence of a taxonomically defined core microbiota in Drosophila (21) suggests that such coevolutionary interactions would be diffuse, involving guilds of microorganisms interacting with multiple animal taxa associated with a diversity of fruits. In addition, Drosophila-associated yeasts have been proposed to modify the fruit habitat to the benefit of Drosophila, a process interpreted as niche construction, and release volatiles that are utilized as foraging and oviposition cues by the insect host (41) . Bacterial partners may also contribute to these effects.",

This study on the relationship between Drosophila and its gut microbiota demonstrates that relatively nonspecific associations that apparently lack sophisticated behavioral mechanisms for controls over the microbiota can similarly play a role in shaping microbiota communities in the wider environment. Priorities for future research include quantitative analysis of the dynamics of bacterial transfer between the host and external environment (45) and investigation of how the principles of these interactions, identified under defined conditions on standardized food substrates, apply to the spatiotemporally complex habitat of a rotting fruit under natural conditions.",

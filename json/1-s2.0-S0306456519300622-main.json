Laboratory based studies investigating the mechanisms of thermoregulation in marine ectotherms, however, rarely consider key temporal elements of thermal exposure, such as the rate at which temperature changes. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus erectus, from a tropical coastal lagoon in Yucatan, Mexico, would exhibit variations in physiological and behavioural descriptors of thermoregulation when submitted to contrasting regimes during 30 days: temperature constant at 25\u00b0C (C 25); gradually increasing 1\u00b0C every 5 days from 25 to 30\u00b0C (GI 25-30); and constant at 30\u00b0C (C 30). Immediately after exposure, critical maximum temperature, thermal preference, oxygen consumption, partial energy balance, growth rate and survival of seahorses were measured. Seahorses exposed to GI 25-30 showed a significantly higher critical thermal maxima (37.8 \u00b1 0.9\u00b0C), preference (28.7 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C), growth (1.10 \u00b1 0.49%) and survival (97.6%) than those exposed to C 30 (36.5 \u00b1 1, 29.4 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C, 0.48 \u00b1 0.32%, 73.8%, respectively). Both high temperature regimes induced metabolic depression, but ramping resulted in a greater amount of energy assimilated (278.9 \u00b1 175.4 J g \u22121 day \u22121) and higher energy efficiency for growth (89.8%) than constant exposure to 30\u00b0C (115.4 \u00b1 63.4 J g \u22121 day \u22121 , 65.3%, respectively). Gradually increasing temperature allowed physiological mechanisms of thermal adjustment to take place, reflecting the capacity of juvenile H. erectus to respond to environmental change. Despite its advantage, this capacity is limited in time, since the cumulative effect of thermal exposure affected metabolic performance, eventually compromising survival. The study of seahorse response to thermal variations in the context of ocean warming needs to consider the temporal elements of thermal exposure to foresee its vulnerability under future scenarios.",

From an evolutionary perspective, the selective pressure of temperature has resulted in the development of long-lasting adaptive capacities to live in specific habitats (Crawshaw, 1977; Pigliucci, 1996) . However, there are considerable differences in the degree to which response to temperature occurs and is reversible (Pigliucci et al., 2006) , hence the need to define phenotypic plasticity as the limits of resilient changes in phenotype under a fluctuating environment (Bradshaw, 1965) . Acclimation has been considered a reversible form of phenotypic plasticity (Beitinger et al., 2000; Madeira et al., 2012) operating at short time scales (Terblanche et al., 2007; Rachalewski et al., 2018) , and has been an experimental condition frequently examined in a broad variety of thermal studies (Tepolt and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102406 Received 3 February 2019; Received in revised form 13 August 2019; Accepted 25 August 2019 Somero, 2014; Padilla-Ramirez et al., 2015; Madeira et al., 2016; Vinagre et al., 2016) .",

Seasonal and latitudinal variations in temperature determine the thermal tolerance of populations (Levinton and Monahan, 1983; Wehrtmann and Kattner, 1998; Morley et al., 2012; Bennett et al., 2018) , and laboratory based experiments have often manipulated acclimation temperatures to examine thermal tolerance in a variety of marine species (Eme and Bennett, 2009; Noyola et al., 2015) . Such manipulations have mostly consisted of abrupt changes and constant exposure to temperature followed by measures of critical thermal limits. These measures are based on either the time of survival at each temperature or the proportion of surviving individuals at a certain time (Lutterschmidt and Hutchison, 1997a) . Since abrupt thermal shifts are rare under natural conditions, authors have recommended exposing organisms to gradually changing temperatures (ramping), particularly when ecologically relevant thermal limits are being investigated (Terblanche et al., 2007) . The magnitude and rate in which temperature changes, as well as the starting point and duration of sub-lethal thermal conditions are important elements when the underlying mechanisms of thermo-regulation are being investigated (Terblanche et al., 2011) .",

With increasing (or decreasing) temperature, aerobic scope is preserved at the expense of increasing oxygen supply to the mitochondria, and the thermoregulatory capacity will consequently depend on the time of exposure to temperatures that pertain to an interval known as pejus (P\u00f6rtner, 2010) . In a thermal continuum, increasing temperatures in this interval will produce a decrease in growth and reproduction as the vulnerability of the population raises (Magozzi and Calosi, 2015) . At extreme temperatures, individuals reach a further thermal limit (pessimum) from which anaerobic mechanisms are activated (i.e. aerobic scope~0) to supply energy for cell repair and basic life maintenance (Sokolova et al., 2012) . These ideas constitute a conceptual model that has proved very useful to identify and explain the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in response to temperature. Nevertheless, empirical studies need to incorporate the relationship between time and its close interaction with thermal exposure explicitly in order to describe and predict the limits of thermal tolerance realistically.",

Despite the recent prominence of studies on thermal tolerance, few in the last years have focused on the effect of temperature on physiological and behavioural traits of seahorses (e. g. Planas et al., 2012; Aurelio et al., 2013) and gene expression of HSP and reproduction (e. g. Johnson, 2017; Qin et al., 2018) . Most, however, are confined to the aquaculture context (e.g. Wong and Benzie, 2003; Lin et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2010) . A few reports on syngnathids from temperate regions (e.g. Syngnathus acus, Russell, 1994; S. scovelli, Power and Attrill, 2003; H. guttulatus, Lin et al., 2006) have considered a possible thermal threshold~30\u00b0C after which fish growth, reproduction and escape behaviour (camouflage) decline and the individuals' survival may be at risk. Aurelio et al. (2013) suggested that early juvenile H. guttulatus have higher thermal sensitivity than adults and could display greater metabolic adjustments under extreme thermal stress. The lack of information on syngnathid populations from tropical regions, by contrast, is noteworthy.",

Results have shown juvenile H. erectus have a critical thermal maximum ranging from 33.1 \u00b1 1.4 to 36.2 \u00b1 1.2\u00b0C, and a minimum ranging from 7.0 \u00b1 0.7 to 11.9 \u00b1 2.1\u00b0C, depending on whether previous acclimation temperature was 18 and 30\u00b0C, respectively (Mascar\u00f3 et al., 2015) . The maximum lethal limits were established at 35.4 \u00b1 0.5 and 38.7 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C for the respective acclimation temperatures, but no deaths were observed when temperature decreased to < 4\u00b0C at a rate of 1\u00b0C per minute (Amaral, 2013). In addition, thermal preference in juvenile seahorses was 25.7 \u00b1 0.9\u00b0C whether seahorses had been previously acclimated to either temperature (Huipe-Zamora, 2015). Most outstanding was that seahorses kept at 30\u00b0C over long time periods (> 30 days) showed a significantly lower growth rate than those kept at 18\u00b0C, suggesting that 30\u00b0C is outside the optimus (sensu P\u00f6rtner, 2010) , and its detrimental effect will depend markedly on time of exposure. The present study aimed to compare the cumulative effect of a high and sustained exposure, to a gradually increasing temperature on the thermal tolerance and preference of juvenile H. erectus from a tropical coastal lagoon. Our intention was to relate the thermoregulatory response to measures of seahorse growth, survival and partial energy balance, including respiration, energy ingested, produced and assimilated (for definitions see Lucas and Watson, 2014) . Experiments were set to demonstrate that abrupt thermal change, combined with constant exposure to temperatures near pejus, might result in high energy demanding thermoregulatory mechanisms. A persistent exposure to a sublethal temperature should modify thermal tolerance and preference, and reflect in the aerobic metabolism by reducing energy supply for growth. By contrast, a gradual increase to a similar final temperature could allow seahorses to compensate for the energy cost associated with thermoregulation.",

Seahorses in C 30 required a preparation period to raise water temperature at a rate of 1\u00b0C day \u22121 for 4 days from 25 to 29\u00b0C. During this time, seahorses in treatments C 25 and GI 25-30 were maintained at 25\u00b0C. The fifth day of the preparation period was also the first day of the experimental period, adding up to a total of 34 days (Fig. 1) . Water temperature was increased by means of two 300 W submergible heaters (BioPro H-100) and a chiller (Resun\u00ae CL-600) directly connected to the water reservoir in the recirculation system. Thermal regimes were chosen to contrast a sustained exposure to a high but sublethal temperature of 30\u00b0C (Mascar\u00f3 et al., 2015) to one where temperature increases slowly from 25\u00b0C and does not exceed 30\u00b0C. Exposure for no more than 30 days was established to assure the survival of individuals and descriptors to be measured. A constant regime at 25\u00b0C was included as a control, since this was the temperature preferred by juvenile H. erectus and is considered optimum for its maintenance under controlled conditions (Huipe-Zamora, 2015). It should be noted that both the magnitude and rate of increase in the temperatures used in this study are well within those experienced by juvenile seahorses at Chelem (Mari\u00f1o-Tapia and Enr\u00edquez, 2010; Table  S1 ).",

Water temperature in the bath was rapidly increased to impede acclimation using a 1000 W heater (~1\u00b0C minute ; Lutterschmidt and Hutchison, 1997b) , and observations of seahorse behaviour and temperature were recorded every minute. The criteria for critical thermal maxima (CTM) estimation was the loss of equilibrium and pronounced shaking or spasms (Mascar\u00f3 et al., 2015) . Three control trials were conducted where another 24 seahorses (n = 8 from each treatment) were placed in chambers in a similar manner but water was maintained constant at the temperature to which they were last exposed in each thermal regime (Fig. 1) . Observations of seahorses from each treatment and its respective control were compared to assure that changes in behaviour were strictly due to thermal exposure. Survival was monitored for 24 h after trials and seahorses were returned to their respective aquaria.",

The thermal history of an individual has been pointed out as one of the main factors influencing critical thermal limits in marine ectotherms (Lutterschmidt and Hutchison, 1997a; Dallas and Rivers-Moore, 2012) . Both the temperature and duration of previous acclimation are known to modify the physiological and behavioural response to further thermal exposure (Vinagre et al., 2016; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2017) . Results in the present study were no exception, given that the CTM of seahorses previously maintained at a constant 25\u00b0C was significantly lower than of those exposed to higher temperatures. Moreover, the differences observed amongst seahorses in the C 30 and GI 25-30 regimes constitute evidence that the rate in which temperature increases determines the thermal tolerance and preference in this species. Juvenile H. erectus subject to gradual increments of 1\u00b0C were capable of an immediate and progressive response that occurred during the 5-day interval following each step. Such a time lapse probably enabled the kinetic stimulation of biochemical reactions by moderate warming (Madeira et al., 2016; S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2017) . This may have triggered compensatory physiological and biochemical mechanisms that were activated only after certain temperature-time exposures, thereby leading seahorses through the transition between a fully functional acclimation capacity to a condition of acclimation in protection (see P\u00f6rtner, 2010; Sokolova et al., 2012; Tepolt and Somero, 2014; Farrell, 2016) .",

Garcia-Rueda (2017) found that acclimation to fluctuating temperatures increased the range of thermal tolerance in Callinectes sapidus from the southern Gulf of Mexico but not in Octopus maya from the Yucatan Peninsula. The author explained this could be related to the ubiquitous nature of the eurythermal crab species, in contrast with the tropical octopus endemic to Yucatan. The extensive latitudinal distribution of H. erectus along the estuaries of the West coast of the American Atlantic (Fritzsche and Vincent, 2002; Lourie, 2004) has been used to explain the relatively large thermal polygon (171-302\u00b0C 2 ) and high phenotypic plasticity (4.7\u00b0C) estimated for the population in Chelem (Mascar\u00f3 et al., 2015) . Based on their findings the authors believed that populations of H. erectus in the southern Gulf of Mexico could be close to the upper thermal limit of the species, at which phenotypic plasticity reaches a threshold. In the present study, the phenotypic plasticity calculated for seahorses maintained under a constant thermal regime was 4.6\u00b0C but rose to 5.9\u00b0C when temperature was increased gradually, suggesting that not only the magnitude but the rate of thermal increase plays an important role in the adaptive response to temperature.",

The low ingestion rates amongst sea horses in C 30 and GI 25-30 indicated that exposure to temperatures above the optimal may limit the consumption of enough food to satisfy energetic demands. Appetite loss has been shown to be an immediate response to thermal (Noyola et al., 2013) and other conditions of environmental stress (Vernberg and Piyatiratitivorakul, 1998; Hulathduwa et al., 2007) , and food avoidance constitutes a behavioural mechanism displayed by animals in order to save metabolic energy that would otherwise be used for the highly demanding postprandial processes. However, that seahorses exposed to temperatures above 25\u00b0C ingested less food did not entirely explain the differences in growth rate observed throughout this study, and these were probably the result of events taking place after food ingestion.",

In the present study, routine oxygen consumption was high in seahorses exposed to 25\u00b0C, reflecting an optimum condition; but decreased markedly in individuals subject to higher temperatures. These results suggest that both a gradually increasing and a high and constant thermal exposure correspond to conditions beyond pejus for juvenile H. erectus, since both induced metabolic depression.

Not only did seahorses under ramping increase the total amount of energy assimilated but they were more efficient in the use of that energy for growth, as shown by the relative measures of assimilation and production of seahorses in those treatments. The progressively increasing temperature might have provided enough time for seahorses exposed to moderate warmth to respond by giving precedence to biomass production, particularly at the beginning of the ramp. As time went by, and temperature reached~30\u00b0C, part of the assimilated energy may have been gradually re-directed to maintenance activities. Whilst the temperaturetime combination in which this shift in energy direction occurred is still unknown, ramping resulted in seahorses with a low routine metabolism, but growth rates as high as those under optimal conditions. Thus, a future characterization of the physiological and biochemical stages through which seahorses transit from an optimal to moderate and severe stress conditions should take into account a temperature-time element intrinsically involved in thermal exposure.",

These results indicate that compensatory mechanisms were also activated among seahorses under constant thermal exposure, but these were clearly unsuccessful in the extent of the functional response they produced: not only did they fail in keeping the growth coefficient above 1% day \u22121 but were ineffective in maintaining survival of seahorses at levels above 80% after 30 days. In other studies, juvenile H. erectus kept at such temperature for periods longer than 30 days have also eventually died (Huipe-Zamora, 2015). These results clearly set 30\u00b0C as a thermal threshold in which seahorses may shift from a sublethal to a lethal condition depending on time of exposure. Sokolova et al. (2012) explored the links between metabolism, energy balance and stress tolerance in aquatic invertebrates and proposed that energy-related biomarkers could be used to determine the conditions when metabolic transitions from moderate stress to extreme stress occur. Considering the results found in the present study, we have modified the diagrammed summary presented by these authors to include the rate of thermal increase and time of exposure as important elements of the response to temperature in juvenile H. erectus (Fig. 7 ). When exposed constantly to 25\u00b0C, seahorses used 76% and 24% of assimilated energy for production and respiration, showing that ATP supply via aerobic metabolism is sufficiently high to cover the costs of growth (G), maintenance and other ATP-demanding activities (coloured boxes). When exposed to a gradually increasing temperature, seahorses ingested less energy and decreased the aerobic metabolism in absolute numbers, but maintained high energy assimilation and directed 89% of it to production. The result was an increase in the daily growth coefficient. By contrast, when exposed constantly to a high temperature, seahorses reduced the aerobic metabolism and only 65% of assimilated energy was used for production, most of which was for maintenance. Because the response to high temperature is energetically demanding (Sokolova et al., 2012; Magozzi and Calosi, 2015) , more energy was directed towards respiration and maintenance in those seahorses subject to the highest thermal stress (Fig. 7) .",

By contrast, a gradually increasing temperature enabled a further expansion of seahorse plasticity in response to warming, a feature that could represent a selective advantage amongst species from thermally heterogeneous habitats. Such an advantageous response, however, appears to be limited to a short period of time before the effect of exposure becomes chronic. Evidence in this direction has been previously reported both in juvenile H. erectus (Lin et al., 2009) and the tropical species form the Indo-Pacific, Hippocampus kuda (Lin et al., 2006) in studies conducted to improve culture protocols. These showed that moderately high temperature can promote growth and survival, increase fecundity and gonadosomatic index and reduce the duration of gonad development in seahorses kept at temperature as high as 29\u00b0C, but these benefits become compromised once thermal exposure reaches ca. 30\u00b0C (Lin et al., 2008; Aurelio et al., 2013) .",

Gradual thermal changes like the ones used in the ramp in the present study can be expected to occur in the coastal lagoons of the southern Gulf of Mexico and Yucatan peninsula, where H. erectus is distributed. In Chelem Lagoon, mean water temperature can rise from 18 to 30\u00b0C from February to July and August, a period of approximately 6-7 months (Jim\u00e9nez, 2012) . At the peak of the dry season (April-May), mean temperature at the centre of the lagoon can fluctuate between 22 and 30\u00b0C (Mari\u00f1o-Tapia and Enr\u00edquez, 2010), whereas shallow areas can register up to 36-38\u00b0C (CONANP, 2006) . Juvenile H. erectus are abundant in shallow waters, where the relatively dense submerged vegetation produces moderate hypoxia conditions during the dark hours of the day. Under such temporally heterogeneous environment, seahorses can use their physiological plasticity to survive and may momentarily take advantage of favourable combinations of temperature and hypoxia that stimulate biomass production. The effect of temperature on seahorse growth and survival under other ecologically relevant magnitudes and rates of thermal increment and hypoxia is something that remains to be investigated.",

Whilst the evolutionary history of the gender Hippocampus is not yet fully understood, the global distribution of seahorses reflects a major dispersion event (Teske et al., 2004) taking place in shallow coastal waters characterized by marked thermal fluctuations. Under this scenario, seahorses probably developed physiological adaptations to compensate for thermal changes occurring at different temporal and spatial scales. Such environmental conditions could have promoted the dispersion of the group in its evolutionary history and help to explain the amplitude of the thermal tolerance found in tropical populations of H. erectus today.",

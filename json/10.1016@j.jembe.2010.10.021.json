In this study, we compared the hemolytic, vasoconstrictor, and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activities of the crude aqueous extracts prepared from normal and bleached specimens of two hydrocorals collected in the Mexican Caribbean, Millepora alcicornis and Millepora complanata. Electrophoretic analysis revealed some differences between the protein profiles of the extracts prepared from normal and bleached specimens. Bleaching decreased, but not abolished, the hemolytic effect induced by the hydrocorals extracts and the phospholipase A activity of M. complanata extract. Furthermore, it did not modify the enzymatic activity of M. alcicornis extract and vasoconstriction elicited by both extracts. Our results suggest that the presence of the symbionts does not importantly influence the pharmacological and toxic effects induced by Millepora ssp. extracts, and indicate that cnidarians are the main source of the bioactive compounds.",

Particularly, the reefs of the Mexican Caribbean support large populations of Millepora alcicornis and Millepora complanata (Lewis, 2006) . When they come into contact with human skin, these species, commonly known as \"fire corals\", can cause severe pain, eruptions, and blisters as a result of the release of unidentified toxins (Sagi et al., 1987; Bianchini et al., 1988) . These toxins are also capable of inducing systemic toxic effects in humans, including nephrotic syndrome, acute renal failure, and pulmonary edema (Prasad et al., 2006) . Several studies have demonstrated that venoms from Millepora tenera, M. alcicornis, Millepora dichotoma, and Millepora platyphylla display lethal, hemolytic, dermonecrotic, and antigenic properties (Wittle et al., 1971 Middlebrook et al., 1971; Wittle and Wheeler, 1974; Radwan, 2002) .",

Bleaching, which is caused by elimination of algal cells from the symbiosis or by loss of algal pigments (Brown, 1997) , can be triggered by multiple factors (Douglas, 2003; Jones, 2004) , but most bleaching observed in the field is a result of elevated sea surface temperature associated with global warming in combination with high solar radiation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007) . It has been widely documented that bleaching is deleterious to coral reefs as bleached organisms display depressed growth rates, increased susceptibility to pathogens and mechanical damage, and reduced survivorship (Szmant and Gassman, 1990; Baird and Marshall, 2002) . However, up to now the impact of bleaching on the production of toxins by the cnidarians is unknown since our understanding of the relevance of the symbiosis to the synthesis of these toxins is very limited.",

Indirect evidence that the hydrocorals, not the symbiotic zooxanthellae, are the source of the vasoactive compounds was obtained when it was found that extracts prepared from bleached specimens displayed concentration-dependent vasoconstrictor effects that were not significantly different from those induced by extracts obtained from control specimens. These findings rule out the possibility that compounds such as zooxanthellatoxins (Asari et al., 1993; Nakamura et al., 1993) and zooxanthellamides (Onodera et al., 2004 (Onodera et al., , 2005 Fukatsu et al., 2007) could be responsible for the vasoconstriction induced by Millepora extracts.

These results support the hypothesis that the excitatory effect elicited by the aqueous extracts of M. complanata and M. alcicornis is caused by both heat-stable and heat-labile compounds. In this respect it is worth mentioning that toxins that have been isolated from cnidarians are primarily proteins or polypeptides with biological activities labile at temperatures above 60\u00b0C (Anderluh and Macek, 2002; Messerli and Greenberg, 2006) . On the other hand, several studies have demonstrated that the phylum Cnidaria is a rich source of bioactive secondary metabolites (Fenical, 2003; Blunt et al., 2004 Blunt et al., , 2005 Blunt et al., , 2006 Blunt et al., , 2007 . Therefore, it is very likely that the heat-stable vasoconstrictor compounds contained in the hydrocorals extracts are secondary metabolites. Nevertheless, considering that some thermostable peptidic toxins have been found in venoms from snakes and scorpions (Ali et al., 1998; Doley and Mukherjee, 2003) , the presence of this kind of toxins in Millepora species cannot be discounted.",

In addition, these extracts exhibited PLA 2 activity. Both hemolytic and enzymatic activities were abolished when the extracts were incubated in a boiling water bath for 20 min. It has been widely recognized that cnidarians produce cytolysins, which either form pores or hydrolyze membrane phospholipids (Anderluh and Macek, 2002; Nevalainen et al., 2004) . Thus, it is quite probable that the thermolabile toxins responsible for the hemolysis produced by Millepora extracts are mainly cytolysins with PLA activity.

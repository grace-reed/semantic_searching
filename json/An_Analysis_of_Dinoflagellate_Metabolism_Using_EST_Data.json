They are the sister group of the Apicomplexa, a group of intracellular parasites and photosynthetic algae including the malaria parasite Plasmodium. Many apicomplexan mitochondria have a number of unusual features, including the lack of a pyruvate dehydrogenase and the existence of a branched TCA cycle. Here, we analyse dinoflagellate EST (expressed sequence tag) data to determine whether these features are apicomplexan-specific, or if they are more widespread. We show that dinoflagellates have replaced a key subunit (E1) of pyruvate dehydrogenase with a subunit of bacterial origin and that transcripts encoding many of the proteins that are essential in a conventional ATP synthase/Complex V are absent, as is the case in Apicomplexa. There is a pathway for synthesis of starch or glycogen as a storage carbohydrate. Transcripts encoding isocitrate lyase and malate synthase are present, consistent with ultrastructural reports of a glyoxysome. Finally, evidence for a conventional haem biosynthesis pathway is found, in contrast to the Apicomplexa, Chromera and early branching dinoflagellates (Perkinsus, Oxyrrhis).",

In the asexual stage the majority of cellular ATP is synthesized through glycolysis and lactic acid production (Uyemura et al. 2004) . There is no evidence for a mitochondrial acetyl-CoA source, as the sole pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is located in the apicoplast (Foth et al. 2005) . Despite this, it is clear that the Plasmodium mitochondrion is functional (Howe and Purton 2007; Painter et al. 2007) . A recent metabolic analysis has shown that the Plasmodium TCA cycle is branched, bifurcating at 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and that malate is produced as a waste product (Olszewski et al. 2010) . The mitochondrial electron transport chain is missing a conventional complex I, replacing it with a single-subunit NADH dehydrogenase (Mogi and Kita 2010), and major components Chromera is a recently-discovered photosynthetic apicomplexan.

The diagram is based on two hsp90 and rDNA phylogenies inferred by Hoppenrath and Leander (2010). There is poor phylogenetic support for many dinoflagellate relationships, and so this diagram should be taken as a guide only. However, it is clear that Perkinsus and Oxyrrhis are early-branching dinoflagellates and the remaining groups are monophyletic.",

Although ESTs corresponding to the majority of enzymes were present, there were none encoding hexokinase, an enzyme which encodes an irreversible step in glycolysis. Instead, in Perkinsus only, a transcript encoding glucokinase was present, an enzyme which catalyses the same reaction but with a lower affinity for glucose (a protein alignment is shown in Supplementary Table S2 ). The use of glucokinase at the start of the glycolysis pathway has previously been reported in a number of protist lineages including Giardia, Trichomonas, Trypanosoma and Leishmania (C\u00e1ceres et al. 2007; Henze et al. 2001; Wu et al. 2001) , although many other eukaryotes contain both enzymes. Ciliates are also missing hexokinase (Smith et al. 2007b) , and instead contain a glucokinase (NCBI ref: XP_002287250). Thus, it would appear that the gene encoding a glucokinase has independently been transferred into the eukaryotic lineage several times (Henze et al. 2001) , and the presence in dinoflagellates and ciliates adds a further gene transfer event(s) to those already described. No transcript encoding glucose-6-phosphatase was identified. This is perhaps not surprising as glucose-6-phosphatase activity, if combined with a bidirectional glucose transport pathway, would lead to glucose efflux.",

It therefore seems likely that that the genes encoding a conventional pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit were lost prior to the separation of the dinoflagellate and apicomplexan lineages. These were then replaced by either PNO (in the early-branching dinoflagellate and Apicomplexa lineages) or with a bacterial-type E1 (other dinoflagellate lineages). Thus, the history of the pyruvate dehydrogenase in dinoflagellates is extremely interesting, for it involves two separate gene transfer events, each solving the same issue (the absence of E1 enzyme) in a different way. TCA cycle: The first step in the TCA cycle is the condensation of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA by citrate synthase to form citrate. Transcripts corresponding to citrate synthase were identified in the dinoflagellate EST databases. The second step is the conversion of citrate to isocitrate by aconitase, an Fe-S cluster protein. Most eukaryotes contain two forms of aconitase, one mitochondrial (involved in the TCA cycle) and a cytoplasmic version. Plasmodium and Tetrahymena contain a single aconitase (similar to the cytoplasmic version) dually targeted to the cytosol and mitochondrion (Smith et al. 2007b; van Dooren et al. 2006) . ESTs for a single isoform of aconitase were identified in the dinoflagellates. However, in contrast to the situation with Plasmodium and Tetrahymena, it was more similar to the mitochondrial isoform. It is possible that the ancestral alveolate contained both types of aconitase and the dinoflagellates subsequently lost the cytosolic form, whereas the ciliates and Apicomplexa lost the mitochondrial form, retargeting the cytoplasmic form.",

Transcripts were found encoding an isocitrate dehydrogenase which appeared to be NADP-linked, based on sequence similarity to other isocitrate dehydrogenases, and targeted to the mitochondrion (Danne and Waller 2011). No evidence of transcripts for cytosolic or NAD-linked isoforms was found. The NADPlinked enzyme may function in the reverse direction (isocitrate synthesis) in mitochondria of other organisms, although roles in the direction of isocitrate oxidation have also been postulated (reviewed by Sazanov and Jackson 1994). It is possible that dinoflagellates possess an NAD-linked enzyme with transcripts at low abundance. Alternatively, (and assuming the TCA cycle functions in the usual direction in contrast to the situation in Plasmodium (Olszewski et al. 2010)) the NADP-linked enzyme might be used for isocitrate oxidation. The resulting NADPH could be used directly, or the reducing equivalents transferred to NAD by a transhydrogenase, for which ESTs were also found. Biochemical data on the NADPH/NADP ratio in dinoflagellate mitochondria would help to clarify the role of the NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase. ESTs corresponding to an oxoglutarate translocator were identified in two Alexandrium species, indicating that 2-oxoglutarate produced by isocitrate oxidation could be exported from the mitochondrion if necessary. The fourth step, the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA by oxoglutarate dehydrogenase is possible, as transcripts encoding this enzyme were also found. However, no transcripts encoding 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase were identified in Perkinsus (although they were present in Oxyrrhis).",

The first step of the bypass involves 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase, a TPP-containing enzyme homologous to acetolactate synthase. Searching Perkinsus ESTs with the predicted protein sequence from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 identified a 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase homologue.

Allen et al.

Both the latter criteria are seen with dinoflagellates (Nash et al. 2008) .

Initially, pABA is synthesized in the chloroplast, and pterin is synthesized in the cytosol. Both are imported to the mitochondrion. Here, the pterin is activated and linked to the pABA by a bifunctional enzyme, HPPK-DHPS (6-hydroxymethyldihydroprotein pyrophosphokinase -dihydropteroate synthase) forming dihydropteroate. Glutamate is then attached to dihydropteroate by the enzyme DHFS (dihydrofolate synthetase). Transcripts encoding a potential HPPK-DHPS were identified in dinoflagellates, but no obvious DHFS transcript was identified. In plants, the next step is catalyzed by DHFR-TS (dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase), a bifunctional enzyme. Transcripts encoding a wellconserved DHFR-TS were found in dinoflagellates. At this point, the products (H 4 F) can either be exported to the cytoplasm or be retained in the mitochondrion. In both the cytoplasm and the mitochondrion the next step is polyglutamation. This is carried out by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) . No transcript encoding FPGS was identified in the dinoflagellate EST libraries, perhaps because such mRNA transcripts are at a very low abundance.",

Although much is known about mitochondrial protein import in model species, there is significant diversity across the protists, and protein sequences are divergent (e.g. Rada et al. 2011) . Imported proteins initially pass through the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. The TOM complex is composed of multiple subunits. Of these, only transcripts encoding a possible Tom40 and a possible Tom70 were identified in the dinoflagellate EST dataset.

Meanwhile, early branching lineages of dinoflagellates replaced PDH with PNO, usually found in anaerobic mitochondria. Given that Apicomplexa lack a mitochondrial PDH, it would appear that this gene loss/replacement event occurred early on in the alveolate lineage.

However, some question has been raised (10) about the reversibility of step 3 because of the fact that it previously had not been found possible to separate fibrin into partially polymerized fragments, f n. Since f, was not heretofore detectable in solutions of dissolved fibrin, it was thought that fibrin could be dissolved appreciably only in dissociating solvents so that a solution of virtually depolymerized fragments f would necessarily result (10) . It was also suggested (10) that step 3 is not \"truly\" reversible, but can be reversed only with simultaneous, complete reversal of step 2. Therefore, we are presenting evidence here that fibrin can be depolymerized to produce f, , i.e., that step 3 is \"truly\" reversible.",

A convenient medium for high solubility of fibrinogen (at least 70/o) and fibrin (of the order of 2-3%) was found to be 1 M NaBr at pH 5.2-5.3.

Since this equilibrium is being investigated by nitrogen analyses, the procedure of Lorand and Middlebrook (12) , involving dissolution in urea, is not suitable for this purpose. Hence, a solvent was used (1 M NaBr) which did not contain nitrogen. The slow solution process is greatly accelerated by constant, gentle (e.g., magnetic) stirring. To purif) the dissolved fibrin further, it was reclotted by again diluting the NaBr solution by a factor of 20, as above, with the same phosphate buffer (but containing no added thrombin).",

Nitrogen analyses carried out in this laboratory have demonstrated that the fibrinopeptide, which Lorand found in clot supernatants (3), is formed in step 1, which appears to be reversible. These analyses have been carried out on fibrinogen-thrombin mixtures in solvents for which hydrodynamic methods have shown that polymerization (i.e., steps 2 and S) does not talce place. Such solvents are 0.3 M KC1 at pH 5.0, 2 M NaBr at pH 5.6, and 1 M NaBr at pH 5.3. Of these, the 1 M NaBr has been found to be the most satisfactory from the point of view of high solubility and absence of denaturation. The absence of polymerization in this solvent was indicated by ultracentrifugal and flow birefringence measurements (see Figs. 1B and 2 ). The fact that proteolysis (the con- version of F to f in step 1) has taken place is indicated by accumulation of peptide as reaction proceeds, the presence of the peptide being followed by nitrogen analyses on the supernatant liquid remaining after T, F, and f have been precipitated with trichloroacetic acid.7 As found earlier by Laki (2), the sedimentation behavior of F and f are identical; the release of t'he fibrinopeptide in step 1 presumably does not appreciably affect hhe sedimentation propert'ies. Similarly, flow birefringence measurements on F and f indicate no difference between these two species (SW Fig. 2 ).",

By this electrophoretic criterion, the f-material prepared by dissolving fibrin in 1 M NaBr at pH 5.3, is seen to differ from F, presumably, of course, by virtue of the fact that I? has been split off.

Quantitative estimates of the additional free energy involved in breaking such hydrogen bonds (24) account for the apparent stability of the peptide bond(s) being split; i.e., in order to liberate P in a proteolytic reaction it is necessary to break not only a peptide bond but also a number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds which existed between P and f before proteolysis. Since P contains a large number of carboxyl side groups (21) these would be ionized in the pH range of interest (> 5.0) and could function as acceptors, being initially combined in hydrogen-bonding interactions with a number of tyrosyl, lysyl, and a-amino groups on f to make up the F molecule.",

The early stages of polymerization (step 2) would then be a bifunctional one l4 between A1 and DIH. The D2H donors and Az acceptors would not play a role here because there are too few groups available on these sites, thus rendering these sites less reactive for bonding the f molecules together. Also, AZ may not be ionized in the pH region (below 6.3 in 1 M NaBr) where only step 2 takes place, thus preventing cross-linking. Step 2 would then involve the formation of polymers fz , f3 , . . . f, by a bijunctional polymerization14 as shown for 12 The donor groups are located near each other in this schematic representation since it appears that the proteolytic action of thrombin is localized in one portion of the fibrinogen molecule (27) .

Unfortunately, the small variation of (P), with c, at low c, introduces large errors in the determination of the Kn's, these errors being cumulative as n increases. Thus, while this method of analysis indicates that the K,,'s are unequal and gives values of x1 vs. c, it is not possible to obtain precise values of the K, 's. We are presently investigating, from a theoretical point of view, the possibility that K, may increase with n due to entropy effects associated with the large size of the n-mer, but at the same time decrease as n increases due to large charge repulsions. A combination of both effects may account for the sigmoidal character of the curve of Fig. 5 . Further light could probably be shed on the nature of the K,'s by also studying the COpolymerization of F and f in the absence of thrombin. Further, it is felt that the anomalous light-scattering curves (Fig. 3 ) arise from polydispersity.14 It has been possible t,o obtain t,heoretical scattering curves of the form shown in Fig. 3 by postulating the existence of a mixture of fn's with an arbitrary number of discrete values of n. However, in the real case, all values for n must be admissible, so that the form of the arbitrary distribution function chosen for this computation is obviously not a unique one. Also, while one could match the initial portion of the scattering curve of Fig. 3 with a t,heoret,ical curve for monodispersed rods of a suitable value of n, such a value of n would have no significance as far as the distribution function is concerned.",

We may speculate on the reason for the distinction between steps 2 and 3. As already pointed out, DIH and A1 (see Fig. 4 ) are more reactive sites than D2H and AZ because the former sites contain more donor and acceptor groups. Thus, in the early stages of polymerization (and in polymerization in 1 M NaBr below pH 6.3) step 2 is favored. When f, becomes sufficiently long, then enough side groups have accumulated to increase the probability that f, will branch. Such branching will lead to the cross-linking required in gel format.ion. In 1 M NaBr below (but close t'o) pH 6.3, the hydrogen-bond breaking ability of the solvent may be just sufficient to prevent cross-linking between t(he DZH and A? sites if only a fraction of t,he acceptors on A? are ionized near pH 6.3. Above pH 6.3 all the acaceptors on the A2 site are assumed to be ionized and the 1 M NaBr then (-annot' prevent crosslinking hydrogen bonds if f, is long enough. If there is no KaBr present (e.g., in 0.3 M NaCl), then the hydrogen bonding between DJ-I and AZ (which contain few donor and accept'or groups) is not int-erfered with 3) appears to be suitable for equilibrium and kinetic st.udies of the polymerization process.",

These experiment,s demonstrate the reversibility of the polymerization steps (subsequent. to the thrombin-induced proteolytic action on fibrinogen) in fibrin formation. If fibrin is dissolved in 1 111 NaBr at pH 5.3 the monomeric form of activated fibrinogen f is obtained. If it is dissolved in 1 M NaBr at pH 5.8-6.1 a mixture of the monomer and a series of intermediate polymers f, is formed. The conversion of f to f, and vice versa is easily accomplished by control of pH from 5.3 t.o 6.1 and back. The monomeric form (solubilized fibrin at pH 5.",

    "abstract": "The taxonomy of zooxanthellae in marine invertebrate symbioses is not well understood owing mainly to their lack of reliable morphological di\u00a1erences. Nevertheless, previous work using protein and DNA electrophoreses has set the stage for advancing our taxonomic understanding of cnidarian zooxanthellae. Here we present the use of allozymes as genetic markers for distinguishing algal isolates from tridacnid hosts. Zooxanthellae from seven Tridacna and Hippopus species were isolated and maintained in axenic clonal cultures over many generations. Of 16 enzyme systems, a-and b-esterase (EST), esterase-F (EST-F), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were found suitable polymorphic markers of genetic di\u00a1erences among clonal cultures. Of 39 clonal isolates, 97% were found to be genetically distinguishable. This high extent of genetic variation in zooxanthellae within and between clam species was unexpected, and is di\u00a4cult to explain based solely on the general notion of asexual reproduction in symbiotic zooxanthellae. Our results are also consistent with the occurrence of sexual reproduction in clam zooxanthellae. The close genetic similarity of the symbionts of Tridacna gigas, the largest and fastest-growing clam species, and the di\u00a4culty of initiating their clonal cultures in the given nutrient medium, compared with the symbionts of other clam species, are further indicative of possibly distinct algal symbionts in T. gigas. These \u00a2ndings are discussed in light of current taxonomic understanding of these organisms.",

However, genetically similar taxa may be common to a number of taxonomically distant hosts (Rowan & Powers 1991a,b; McNally et al. 1994) . Under controlled conditions, some algal symbionts may infect other hosts (Fitt 1985) , but this does not always occur readily and may result in reduced numbers of infecting symbionts in time (Schoenberg & Trench 1980c) .",

The wild clams originally came from north-eastern, north-western, and western Philippines. As larvae, the cultured clams were initially infected with zooxanthellae extracted from parent clams that originally came from central Philippines and the Solomon Islands. Mantle clippings (51cm ) from each clam were homogenized in 0.45 mm Millipore-\u00a2ltered sea water (MFSW) using a blender, and \u00a2ltered on a double layer of cheese cloth to remove animal mucus and debris (Belda et al. 1993) . Zooxanthellae were collected and washed several times in MFSW by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min to produce freshly isolated zooxanthellae (FIZ). These were then analysed by electrophoresis or brought into crude culture in f/2 media (Guillard & Ryther 1962) at a constant temperature of 28 8C, irradiance level of 150 mE m 72 s 71 , and photoperiod of 12 h:12 h (Belda & Yellowlees 1995) . After a few days of incubation, freshly pulled Pasteur pipettes and an inverted microscope were used to isolate single motile cells from serial dilutions of a drop of zooxanthellae suspension placed in a Petri dish. Single cells were then incubated for at least a month in individual test tubes containing f/2 media, under the above conditions of growth. Viable clones were treated with a triple-antibiotic solution of penicillin G (125 g l ), streptomycin (62.5 g l ), and chloramphenicol (12.5 g l ) for 24 h (Belda 1994) . Sterility tests in nutrient broth were carried out periodically to check for bacterial contamination. Uncontaminated cultures were subcultured into 50-ml cultures and routinely transferred every two weeks. Subsequently, the clonal cultures were further puri\u00a2ed by re-isolating a single algal cell from each parent culture, and growing into a 50-ml culture or a one-litre culture in Fernbach \u00a3asks, under the conditions mentioned above.",

It is likely that our analysis only uncovered a small portion of the total genetic variation in these populations. Indeed, our preliminary analysis of the same clonal cultures using random ampli\u00a2cation of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) has demonstrated that all but a few clonal isolates are genetically distinguished by a single primer analysis (B. K. Baillie, V. Monje, V. Silvestre, M. Sison and C. A. Belda-Bailey, unpublished data) . Such data, in addition to the present results, clearly demonstrate that algae within giant clams are genetically diverse. Further research should establish whether the source of this high genetic variation was clonal mutation or sexual recombination. If clonal mutation was indeed responsible for the variations detected here, symbiotic zooxanthellae probably have little need for sexual reproduction since the degree of genetic variation a\u00a1orded by asexual reproduction is so large. Further study should also determine if the degree of variation detected in this study represents di\u00a1erent algal taxa or individuals within a taxon. Schoenberg & Trench (1980a) reported no detectable di\u00a1erences in the allozyme patterns of clonal isolates from the same host species (i.e. various cnidarian host species, with one T. gigas host individual). The reason for this may be that the PAGE method used in our study was more sensitive and allowed the resolution and detection of more allozyme bands, which were not easily resolved or detected by SGE. Our initial di\u00a4culties in resolving and detecting allozymes on starch gels, in contrast to PAGE, supports this premise. Separation by PAGE is on the basis of di\u00a1erences in charge, molecular weight, and shape (Hames 1990) ; whereas, separation of allozymes on starch gels is primarily due to charge di\u00a1erences (May 1992). Our EST allozyme patterns (\u00a2gure 1a) demonstrate an average of seven bands per isolate, whereas Schoenberg & Trench (1980a) reported an average of three for SGE. This is presumably due to the higher resolution available from PAGE.",

Therefore, it is possible that the bulk of the FIZ have allozyme patterns di\u00a1erent from those of the clonal cultures. In addition, some di\u00a1erences are likely due to the expression of di\u00a1erent zooxanthellal allozymes in situ.",

Among the interesting questions we further seek to address are: (i) do particular zooxanthellae improve clam performance; and (ii) do giant clams exchange or obtain new symbionts following initial infection? Results are forthcoming and will be reported later.",

We have used microarrays to investigate the changes in gene expression at various times after middle cerebral artery occlusion in human and rat brain. Results: Our results demonstrated a significant difference in the number of genes affected and the time-course of expression between the two cases. The total number of deregulated genes in the rat was 335 versus 126 in the human, while, of 393 overlapping genes between the two array sets, 184 were changed only in the rat and 36 in the human with a total of 41 genes deregulated in both cases. Interestingly, the mean fold changes were much higher in the human. The expression of novel genes, including p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), matrix metalloproteinase 11 (MMP11) and integrase interactor 1, was further analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Strong neuronal staining was seen for PAK1 and MMP11. Conclusion: Our findings confirmed previous studies reporting that gene expression screening can detect known and unknown transcriptional features of stroke and highlight the importance of research using human brain tissue in the search for novel therapeutic agents.",

The tissue surrounding this area (peri-infarcted region) is able to maintain some functions, such as ionic homeostasis and can be partially salvaged by blood recirculation [3, 4] .",

Limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in tissue regeneration has been gained from animal experiments using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model which replicates, in many aspects, the neuropathological changes following stroke in humans [5] . Although the contralateral side of the brain is not totally unaffected by ischemic damage, the collection of experimental and reference control tissue from the same animal is a better comparison than using sham-operated control in rats, while in human samples the only control tissue available is contralateral hemisphere. In addition, using contralateral tissue as a control and the direct comparison with stroke hemisphere provides the best model for validation as it removes inter-patient genetic variation and also minimises the differences in potential degradation between the target and reference mRNAs. This has been applied previously in both human [6, 7] and animal [8] [9] [10] studies. Rao et al. in particular observed very few differences in gene expression between sham and contralateral cortex at 24 h of reperfusion following MCAO in the rat [9] .",

Several experimental studies have examined alteration of gene expression in the postischemic rat brain using microarray technology [8] [9] [10] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , while blood genomic profiling in human stroke have been investigated in recent pilot studies [19, 20] (Table 1) .

                "text": "Until recently, gene expression profiling had not been applied to patients dying of ischemic stroke, in part because human brain autopsies are not regularly obtained. Although tissue obtained from brain autopsies is generally of lower quality than that of brain biopsies obtained from living patients, the majority of RNA transcripts and proteins in the human brain are reasonably stable (compared to other tissues such as blood and kidney) and degrade to only a minor degree following death, thus making autopsy tissue a useful source for the isolation of nucleic acids and proteins [21] . Previous studies evaluating the mRNA quality in human post-mortem brain tissue have demonstrated a minimal effect upon their overall relative stability and indicated that frozen brains up to 72 hours post-mortem can be efficiently analyzed [22] . In line with that, in previous human brain studies, tissue was obtained up to a maximum of 6 hours [7] , 40 hours [23] , 45 hours [24] and 69 [6] hours following death. Moreover, after comparing mRNA levels in autopsies and biopsies, Castensson et al. [25] found a general similarity in the levels between the two groups, and suggested that mRNA levels in brain autopsy samples can provide clues about the brain in vivo. Interestingly, Almeida et al. [26] found that, even if performed on degraded RNA, RT-PCR can be used to provide a reliable estimate of in vivo mRNA levels, maybe due to the similarities in the rates of degradation between the target and reference mRNAs. Recently, Vikman and Edvinsson [27] investigated the gene expression in human brain after ischaemia using samples 7-10 days post-stroke; however, they obtained their samples after a considerable delay of 2-3 days post-mortem and they focused mainly on mRNA expression of receptors.",

The Atlas 1.2 cDNA microarray was used to screen for differential expression of 1176 genes and significantly de-regulated genes were selected through image analysis. We further investigated whether the altered mRNA and protein levels of a subset of deregulated molecules in the postischemic brain could be reproduced in an in vitro model of neuronal and endothelial cell culture under conditions of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The findings confirmed previous studies reporting that parallel screening of gene expression can detect both previously documented and novel transcriptional features of the cerebral response to ischemia, and demonstrated significant differences in gene expression between human stroke and the animal model.",

No staining for MMP11 was seen in contralateral areas (Figure 3Di ), but an increase in its expression occurred in neurons following MCAO, in particular at 12 and 24 h ( Figure  3Dii ). MMP11 mRNA and protein levels remained unchanged in HFN and HBMEC exposed to conditions of oxygen-glucose deprivation.",

The present gene expression profile study is the first largescale microarray report showing altered expression of several genes following human stroke. These included genes participating in transcription, apoptosis, inflammation and neuroprotection. Many genes/proteins previously shown to be deregulated following stroke were reported in our study too e.g. IL-10 [30, 31] , PDGF [32] , STAT3 [33, 34] cellular localisation for three induced genes, INI1, PAK1 and MMP11.

P35/ Cdk5 causes PAK1 hyperphosphorylation, which results in PAK1 down-regulation and is likely to have an impact on the dynamics of the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in neurons during dendrite development [36] . Based on this evidence, these authors proposed the existence of a neuron-specific signalling complex involving Cdk5/p35-PAK1 that inhibits PAK1 activity in neurons. We have recently provided evidence for a potential role of Cdk5/p35 in the response to ischaemic injury as we showed association of Cdk5 with nuclear damage, by demonstrating co-expression of Cdk5 in TUNEL-positive neurons following human stroke and in propidium iodide-positive human foetal neurons following OGD [37] . Here, we have reported for the first time an upregulation in PAK1 protein levels in human and rat brain samples following MCAO and in HFN following oxygenglucose deprivation. Although in the animal model PAK1 protein levels returned to normal 3 days following stroke, some patients showed elevated levels for PAK1 at later time-points too. In both human and the animal model, neurons were the predominant type of cells stained positive for PAK1.",

Although other metalloproteinases have been studied extensively following stroke [40, 41] , there is no report of the expression of MMP11 following stroke in vivo or in vitro. Here we report an increase in protein levels of MMP11 following stroke in both human and rat brain, although the increase seen in man remained elevated much longer. Although MMP11 shares many similarities with other MMPs, it also differs in that it exhibits anti-apoptotic properties, a first-known activity for a MMP [42] . Moreover, although it is expressed in many processes involving tissue remodelling, cell migration and cell death, the pathways through which it participates in pathogenesis remain unclear, largely due to the lack of information on its substrates in vivo Many experimental trials of stroke therapies have failed to translate to human clinical trials and one possible way to improve the success rate can be through comparative genomics. As it has been recently commented, it is very surprising that the exciting developments observed in basic and clinical stroke research over the past two decades have occurred in parallel, with too little direct translation between bench and bedside [50] . Here, we have provided substantial evidence that, although the available animal models of MCAO may well be suitable to study the pathophysiological changes following the occlusion of a cerebral vessel, they may not entirely reflect the pathophysiological process through which stroke evolves in humans. The species difference is one of the main reasons accounting for the lack of success of bench to bedside translation in the stroke area. Limitations of our study include the fact that early acute phase changes in gene expression may have been missed since genes induced and returning to normal during the first 48 hours postischaemia in man could not have been detected. Moreover, since we analyzed pooled RNA samples, small changes in gene expression occurring in a minority of the samples may have been missed. However, there was only a small overlap of our results with prior studies in experimental stroke involving brain tissue, and the successful identification of novel ischaemia-related genes reported here suggests that performing a further study using whole genome microarrays would be valuable.",

All patients were admitted with large middle cerebral artery strokes confirmed by CT-scan or MRI. The patients, 10 male and 2 female, were aged between 51 and 86 years and had survived between 2-37 days following ischaemic stroke (Table 2) . Routine blood parameters were determined on admission. Full clinical examinations, including NIH Stroke Scale, were also carried out on admission. Excluded from the study were patients with recent history of head trauma, major cardiac, renal, hepatic or cancerous disease and obvious signs of infection after admission. Immediately after death the body was put in a cold chamber and tissue was collected within 6 h of death. Tissue samples were taken from infarct and peri-infarcted zones while controls were obtained from the contralateral hemisphere at the same time. The peri-infarcted areas were defined in tissue sections as the tissue immediately surrounding the infarcted core which contained some necrotic cells and showed evidence of tissue disorganisation confirmed by histology. Sections were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride which stains active mitochondria pink; therefore, non stained areas represented stroke affected cortical regions (data not included). Tissue specimens were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, kept at -70\u00b0C and a portion of each sample was processed for histology and stained with haematoxylin and eosin to determine tissue morphology [51].",

The corresponding samples from the non-ischemic control hemisphere were used to measure the normal mRNA abundance of the modulated genes in each tissue at each time point. RNA from three stroke patients was pooled for each patient survival group while RNA from three MCAO rats was also pooled at each time-point to improve yields in preparation of poly A + RNA. Although pooling was previously thought to affect data quality, Kendziorski et al. [56] have recently shown that inference was not adversely affected by pooling. The different patient groups were selected to match the three physiological stages following stroke i.e. the inflammatory (lasting up to a maximum of 5-6 days), the proliferative (lasting up to three weeks following stroke) and the remodelling/ maturation (starting during the third or fourth week).",

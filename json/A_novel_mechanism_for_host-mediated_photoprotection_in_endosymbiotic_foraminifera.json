                "text": "The benthic foraminifera Marginopora vertebralis Quoy and Gaimard, 1830, is a large, single-celled, calcifying microorganism belonging to the infrakingdom Rhizaria. It is typically found in coral reef ecosystems, where it is a major contributor to calcite export from the surface waters to the reef structure, with calcium carbonate tests (calcite skeletons) often dominating the sediment (Langer et al., 1997; Doo et al., 2012) . M. vertebralis forms a symbiotic partnership with one of the most important symbiotic algal species in tropical reef systems, the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium (Pawlowski et al., 2001) , renowned for living in endosymbioses with reefbuilding corals across the globe (Baker, 2003) . This partnership has evolved to make use of the abundance of light in the clear, nutrient-poor waters of the reef; whereby the host receives energy from the photosynthetic symbiont in the form of fixed carbon (Lee, 2006) in exchange for providing the symbiont with access to a rich supply of inorganic nutrients. Although light underpins the health and function of coral reef ecosystems, in excess, light can result in reduced photosynthetic efficiency, and if not protected against, damage to the photosynthetic machinery of the symbiont can ensue (Brown et al., 1999; Jones and Hoegh-Guldberg, 2001 ). Therefore, the success of photosymbiotic partnerships relies on the ability for the symbiont and host to regulate incoming irradiance with nutrient acquisition, serving two purposes: (1) to optimise carbon productivity by the symbionts, ultimately benefitting the host, and (2) to minimise the production of reactive oxygen species, which may damage both symbiont and host.",

                "text": "The ubiquity of Symbiodinium in reef symbioses has resulted in extensive research into understanding light regulation and stress responses in these microalgae (Iglesias-Prieto and Trench, 1994; Iglesias-Prieto and Trench, 1997; Jones and Hoegh-Guldberg, 2001) . In corals-the most extensively studied photosymbiotic system in tropical reefsphotoprotection is primarily regulated by the Symbiodinium, which have evolved mechanisms to dissipate excess energy as heat and thus protect their photosystems from damage (Brown et al., 1999) . It has also been shown that the coral host can contribute to light protection via accumulation of fluorescent proteins that absorb light in the harmful wavelengths (Salih et al., 2000; Dove et al., 2008) , or more directly via contraction or expansion of tissue, which modulates the light field around the symbionts within specific tissue layers (Brown et al., 2002; Dimond et al., 2012; Wangpraseurt et al., 2014) . Similar to corals, M. vertebralis is often found in shallow, well-lit waters of the sandy reef sediment (Sinutok et al., 2011) and, therefore, must balance incoming energy with photoprotection. Unlike corals, however, M. vertebralis are motile and as such can achieve photoprotection through relocation to more shaded habitats. Indeed, M. vertebralis has been shown to exhibit negative phototaxis; moving into a shaded environment when exposed to high light, a response proposed to be driven by the lightsensitive symbionts (Sinutok et al., 2013) . Their movement is, however, relatively slow (up to 8 mm h \u2212 1 ) (Khare and Nigam, 2000) and thus ineffective in providing immediate protection from damaging irradiances once exposed. One study has reported a different sort of phototaxis in stationary M. vertebralis, where the symbionts were observed to move vertically within the calcified test from the darker underside to the illuminated top-side (Ross, 1972) . Although not examined in any detail, this movement was assumed to be the result of flagellated Symbiodinium swimming towards the light inside the host test. Here we investigate whether intracellular phototaxis could be used as a means of photoprotection. We show that vertical migration of symbionts within M. vertebralis serves to rapidly and effectively protect the intracellular symbionts under high-light stress. This mode of symbiont migration represents a novel mechanism in which the phototaxis of the symbionts is host-mediated; the relocation of the symbionts being accomplished through host-derived actin filament contraction as opposed to driven by flagellated movement of the symbionts, as was previously assumed. Our study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism for host-mediated photoprotection that may serve as a platform for studying host-symbiont communication in other photosymbiotic organisms such as corals, providing a new means for investigating signalling between the ubiquitous Symbiodinium algae and its host.",

At each time point, the beaker containing the foraminifera was transferred to the PAM and a saturating pulse of light (saturating pulse width = 0.8 s; saturating pulse intensity 43000 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 ) applied to determine minimum (F O ') and maximum fluorescence (F M '). Individuals were then carefully flipped using forceps and the underside measured before being returned to their original orientation and placed back into the incubation bath. From these two parameters the effective quantum yield of PSII was calculated as (Schreiber, 2004) . In addition, prior to the experiment, foraminifera were darkadapted for 30 min and F O and F M recorded to calculate (Schreiber, 2004) . This was repeated at the end of the experiment in both control-and light-treated foraminifera, to measure recovered F V /F M. As a measure of photosynthetic performance at each specific irradiance, excitation pressure over PSII (Q M ) was calculated as 1- (Iglesias-Prieto et al., 2004) . As there was minimal spatial variability in fluorescence signal, all fluorescence values were therefore averaged across the organism. At each time point, three individuals from both light treatments were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C for pigment processing. Individual foraminifera were extracted in chilled 100% acetone containing vitamin E and sonicated for 30 min in iced-water in the dark, then stored in the dark at 4\u00b0C. After 24 h, 333 \u03bcl of polished water was added to reduce the acetone concentration to 90% v/v and sonicated for 15 min in iced-water. The foraminifer test was then removed and dried for area determination (see below). The acetone extracts were filtered directly into amber glass vials (Waters Australia Pty Ltd, Rydalmere, NSW, Australia) through a 0.2 \u03bcm PTFE 13 mm syringe filter (MicroAnalytix Pty Ltd, Taren Point, NSW, Australia) pre-wetted with acetone, and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until analysis via high-performance liquid chromatography following the methods of van Heukelem and Thomas (2001) . Pigments were identified by comparison of their retention times and spectra using calibration standards (DHI, H\u00f8rsholm, Denmark) and integrated using graphical software (Empower Pro, Waters Australia Pty Ltd). For area determination, each test was imaged and measured in ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012) , using the area integration function calibrated to a known standard.",

Histological examination demonstrated that the symbionts relocated to the far side of the foraminiferal test when incoming irradiance was sufficiently high (Figure 2b) . Although the animal tissue fluoresced both in red and green, the stronger red autofluorescence of the algal chlorophyll resulted in a clear red colouration where symbionts were present in the tissue. After 1 h under control light, the majority of the symbionts were close to the surface of the foraminifera (Figure 2b, left) . At moderate irradiance (400 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 ), the symbionts were distributed throughout the test (Figure 2b, middle) , whereas at the highest irradiance (800 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 ) the greatest symbiont density was seen in the undermost chambers of the foraminifera (Figure 2b,  right) .",

Cells incubated with a fluorescent membrane vacuole stain (Trautman et al., 2002) were highly fluorescent, showing the presence of a symbiosome encasing each cell (Supplementary Figure S2) . To further investigate the host mechanism of symbiont relocation, we measured symbiont movement in the presence of the actin filament inhibitor cytochalasin B. The reduction in the photosynthetic efficiency (\u0394F/F M ') of foraminifera exposed to high light, was greater in those treated with cytochalasin B (5 \u03bcg ml \u2212 1 ; Figure 3a ; P = 0.001), where the \u0394F/F M ' at 800 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 was zero (indicative of symbiont death) in six of the eight specimens, highlighting the efficacy of symbiont retraction in providing photoprotection. The addition of cytochalisin B resulted in a 70% reduction in symbiont retraction at 800 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 compared with the controls (Figure 3b ; Po0.001).

Importantly, cytochalasin B has been shown not to affect movement in ciliates or flagellates at concentrations up to 50 \u03bcg ml \u2212 1 (Carter, 1967) , more than twice the concentration employed in this study (5-20 \u03bcg ml \u2212 1 ). As such, it is unlikely that the cytochalasin B would have inhibited any movement driven by Symbiodinium.",

In the DMSO control treatment, we measured a 73% reduction in photosynthetic efficiency at high light compared with the controls (Figure 5 ; Po0.001), where effective quantum yield of PSII (\u0394F/F M ') in the control was 0.45 at 130 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 and dropped to around 0.12 at 800 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 , equivalent to the \u0394F/F M ' in the first set of experiments (Figure 1a) . In contrast, in the presence of DCMU, \u0394F/F M ' was 0.14 at control irradiances dropping below 0.05 at higher light ( Figure 5 ), where six out of the eight foraminifera had no variable fluorescence. We found that DCMU (10 \u03bcM) increased pixel intensity (symbiont retraction) by 20% and 27% in both the control (130 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 ) and high-light (800 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 ) treatments, respectively ( Figure 5 ; P = 0.001), showing there was an initial retraction (increased reflectance) of symbionts with the addition of DCMU. There was, however, no additional retraction with exposure to high light resulting in a 58% reduction in pixel intensity compared with control incubations ( Figure 5 ).",

                "text": "Photoprotection is essential in shallow reef systems where irradiance often exceeds the capacity for photosynthesis (Brown et al., 1999) . Therefore, to avoid cellular damage or a breakdown in the symbiosis, symbiotic partnerships are dependent on the ability of the symbiont and/or host to regulate incoming irradiance. In the present study, the photophysiological responses of the symbionts within M. vertebralis were consistent with general phototrophic responses to high light, with a decline in photosynthetic efficiency and increase in energy dissipation, all indicative of light stress (M\u00fcller et al., 2001) . However, the rapid recovery in photosynthetic efficiency and concomitant reversal of excitation pressure over PSII (Q M ) after return to low light suggests that long-term damage to the photosystem was largely avoided (M\u00fcller et al., 2001). In addition to increasing photosynthetic stress, we also showed that the symbionts relocated from the surface to the middle or underside of the foraminiferal test depending on the level of irradiance. These results demonstrate a correlation between the level of photosynthetic stress (light intensity) and the level of retraction, and thus protection. Although Symbiodinium showed photosynthetic plasticity, it is evident that the physical relocation of surface symbionts into the foraminiferal test contributed to preventing long-term photosynthetic damage. This is supported by a previous study which found that only 30% of the incoming irradiance was able to penetrate to the bottom of the test of M. vertebralis (Kohler-Rink and K\u00fchl, 2000) . In addition to the inherent shading effect of the test itself (Kohler-Rink and K\u00fchl, 2000) , the increased reflectivity of the test decreased the incoming irradiance by an additional 20% upon symbiont retraction. The efficacy of this photoprotective strategy is supported by the high photosynthetic activity measured in symbionts on the underside of the test during exposure to high irradiance and the rapid reversibility in photosynthetic quenching, Q M and xanthophyll pigment epoxidation of surface symbionts when incoming irradiance was lowered. Further support for the effectiveness of the protection offered by the host is provided by the fluorescence measurements in the presence of cytochalasin B, which showed that when vertical migration was prevented, the photosynthetic activity of the symbionts exposed to high light was severely inhibited with no variable fluorescence detectable in six of the eight specimens. It cannot be ruled out, however, that this effect might also have been a result of some inhibitory effect of the cytochalasin B on the chloroplast repair system in the symbionts. The small yet significant increase in pixel intensity (whitening) observed at the highest light level in the presence of cytochalasin B could in fact be attributed to loss of colouration from photobleaching of the chlorophyll in the immobilised symbionts. If so, this further supports the importance of this mechanism in the photoprotection of the symbionts in M. vertebralis.",

                "text": "The concept of phototaxis as a means for optimising light for photosynthesis in free-living microalgae is well studied. However, due to the inherent complexity of organisms living in symbioses, less is known about light regulation in symbiotic algae, and much less about the role of the host in this regulation. Until now, the only research on phototaxis in benthic endosymbiotic foraminifera has been focused on their propensity for seeking out shade through pseudopodal locomotion when exposed to high irradiances (Sinutok et al., 2013; Zmiri et al., 1974; Lee et al., 1980) . In the only other study reporting the observation of intracellular phototaxis in M. vertebralis, the movement was believed to be driven by the symbionts themselves through flagella propulsion (Ross, 1972) . However, the data presented here provides strong evidence for the phototaxic movement being host-rather than symbiont-driven: the coccoid, as opposed to gymnodinioid morphology of the symbionts is indicative of Symbiodinium in their non-motile, vegetative stage (Freudenthal, 1962) , and the presence of a symbiosome membrane around the symbiont cells preclude the likelihood that symbionts could propel or move themselves within the host tissue. We saw a significant reduction in symbiont retraction and symbiont movement within individual chambers of the foraminifera test when actin filament contraction was inhibited (Estensen et al., 1971) . This corroborates that the movement is host-mediated as well as provides the first insight into the mechanisms behind this movement. The ability to adjust intracellular symbiont position is likely an important means to optimise carbon production, calcification and minimise photosynthetic damage, and can be described as akin to the chloroplastic migration observed in phototrophic organisms, also known as chloroplast photorelocation (Suetsugu and Wada, 2012) . This lightdependent process optimises photosynthesis and photoprotection through dispersion or aggregation of the chloroplasts to maximise light capture or shading, respectively (Wada, 2013) . The action of chloroplast photorelocation is driven by the common motor proteins actin and myosin (Suetsugu and Wada, 2012) , which together with microtubules are responsible for the movement of cellular organelles in eukaryotic organisms. In the case of photosymbiotic organisms, however, the chloroplast is replaced by an entire algal cell. One of few known examples of photorelocation in a symbiotic organism is that of the single-celled protist Paramecium bursaria. Known as the 'green Paramecium', P. bursaria is symbiotic with the green, non-motile microalgae Chlorella. When exposed to high light, P. bursaria will aggregate its symbionts, presumably to shade both the host and the Chlorella cells, whereas it distributes the Chlorella cells evenly in low light, maximising light uptake (Summerer et al., 2009) . The phototaxis shown here demonstrates photorelocation in M. vertebralis as a means of optimising light capture and protection. The dynamic nature of the regulation of endosymbiont location by the host suggests that it is closely coupled with the intensity of the incoming irradiance and the time of exposure. Furthermore, the ability for M. vertebralis to move its symbionts within its test may explain its propensity to attach to opaque surfaces (Sinutok et al., 2011; Sinutok et al., 2013) , thereby eliminating light input from the attached side and thus optimise the efficacy of shading and photoprotection during the retraction of the symbionts.",

In high light, the photosynthetic stress experienced by the symbiont is converted to a signal that leads to reorganisation by the protist to ensure no damage to its energy-producing 'solar cells'. This not only reduces the likelihood of photosynthetic damage from increased reactive oxygen, but enables carbon fixation and possibly light-dependent calcification, as observed in other foraminifera (Hallock, 1981; Lea et al., 1995) , to continue unimpeded. By chemically reducing the photosynthetic efficiency of the symbionts (addition of DCMU), under control light conditions, partial retraction of symbionts was observed, indicative of photosynthetic stress. However, the addition of high light further quenched the photosystem to dysfunctional levels (\u0394F/F M 'o0.05) but did not induce any further vertical migration. The lack of movement under high light indicates a photosynthetically derived communication signal between partners, where the host's removal of its symbionts relies on an infochemical or signal that is generated by photosynthesis. Furthermore, as DCMU blocks the transport of electrons through the photosynthetic electron transport chain at the beginning of the photochemical pathway, it would suggest that any signalling molecule is a result of downstream processes, relying on photosynthates (ATP, NADPH) derived from photosynthetic electron transport and carbon fixation. One potential candidate signal molecule worthy of investigation could be a type of reactive oxygen that is produced during photosynthetic stress (Lesser 2006 ).",

We uncovered a novel mechanism for hostmediated photoprotection via the intracellular relocation of endosymbionts, whereby the host, upon receiving a signal from the symbionts, mobilises cellular proteins to relocate the symbionts deeper within its calcium carbonate test, thus providing protection and ensuring the health of the partnership. Furthermore, the behavioural response described here suggest phototaxis is driven by symbiont stress signalling, where the infochemical is derived from downstream processes of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Our findings highlight the central importance of the host in photosymbiotic photoprotection. The dynamic nature of the photoregulatory response described here opens up new avenues to investigate symbiont-host stress physiology and symbiont-host signalling for other photosymbiotic species, such as corals, where the largest knowledge gap is the communication or signalling between the host and the symbiont during physiological stress that results in coral bleaching, the catastrophic collapse of the symbiotic partnership.",

(a) Effective quantum yield of PSII (\u0394F/F M ') for the surface (circles) and underside (triangles) of Marginopora vertebralis exposed to constant light (CL; black) and increasing light (IL; blue) over 3 h (200, 400 and 800 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u22121 ) with a final hour of recovery (130 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 ) (n = 8). (b) Excitation pressure over PSII (Q M ) on the surface of M. vertebralis (circles; n = 8) and the de-epoxidation ratio of photoprotective pigments (bars; n = 3) exposed to constant low (130 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 ) light (black) and increasing irradiance over 3 h+recovery (blue). (c) Relative change in average pixel intensity on the surface (circles) and underside (triangles) of M. vertebralis exposed to constant (black) and increasing light over 3 h+recovery (blue) (n = 5-8). (d) Spectral reflectance as a percentage of a pure white standard measured on the surface of M. vertebralis exposed to increasing irradiances. Arrows indicate characteristic absorption wavelengths of Symbiodinium: chlorophyll a (435-440, 675 nm), chlorophyll c (460 nm) and peridinin (480-490 nm), dashed lines indicate s.e.m. (n = 8). (e) Total integrated reflectance at the surface of M. vertebralis exposed to increasing irradiances over time (T0-T3) (n = 8). (f) Photographs illustrating the sequential whitening (from top left to bottom right) of one M. vertebralis exposed to high light. Scale bar = 5 mm. Data represent mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Asterisk (*) indicates values that are significantly different between light treatments and superscript letters denote significantly different over time (Po0.05).

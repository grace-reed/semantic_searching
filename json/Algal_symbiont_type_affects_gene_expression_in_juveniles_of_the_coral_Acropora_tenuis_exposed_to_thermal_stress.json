The responses of corals associated with different Symbiodinium clades to thermal stress are not well understood, especially at a gene expression level. Juveniles of the coral Acropora tenuis inoculated with different algal types (clade A or D) were exposed to thermal stress and the expression levels of four putative stress-responsive genes, including genes coding green and red fluorescent proteins, an oxidative stress-responsive protein, and an ascorbic acid transporter, were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR.

The intensity of green fluorescence increased with temperature in clade D symbionts harboring juveniles, but not in juveniles associated with clade A symbionts.

Large-scale coral bleaching has been ascribed to increases in seawater temperature induced by climate change resulting from the greenhouse effect (Glynn, 1993; Crabbe, 2008) . Coral bleaching is a breakdown of the symbiotic association between reef-building corals and their symbiotic algae, dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium. Symbiodinium spp. consist of nine clades (AeI) (Baker, 2003; Coffroth and Santos, 2005; Pochon and Gates, 2010) . Symbionts of clades A, B, C, and D are commonly associated with metazoan hosts (Baker, 2003) , while clade C, E, F, G, H, and I are associated with large soritid foraminifera (Pochon and Pawlowski, 2006; Pochon and Gates, 2010) . They are further divided into many subclades and strains (Coffroth and Santos, 2005) .",

The clade D Symbiodinium has been characterized as heat-or stress-tolerant based on its increased prevalence in the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific corals after bleaching events (Glynn et al., 2001; Toller et al., 2001; Baker et al., 2004; van Oppen et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2008) . However, few studies have compared stress responses among corals hosting different Symbiodinium clades. In the high temperatures and turbid conditions of the north-eastern Indian Ocean, clade D Symbiodinium were more diverse and frequently observed than clade C in coral hosts (LaJeunesse et al., 2010) . Colonies of Acropora millepora that had shuffled their dominant endosymbiont from C2 to D following bleaching exhibited higher photochemical efficiency and greater symbiont densities than C2-dominated colonies when exposed to heat stress (Berkelmans and van Oppen, 2006) . On the other hand, Acropora tenuis juveniles associated with clade C1 symbionts showed much greater thermal tolerance than those associated with clade D symbionts based on photochemical efficiency measurements (Abrego et al., 2008) . These results suggest that corals associated with different subclades of Symbiodinium might show different stress responses.",

Recent studies have examined the gene expression patterns during thermal stress using cDNA microarrays as well as other gene expression analysis tools (Desalvo et al., 2008; Rodriguez-Lanetty et al., 2009; Voolstra et al., 2009) . Heat shock proteins, superoxide dismutase, lectin, antioxidant proteins, and other genes have been identified as stress biomarkers in reefbuilding corals (Downs et al., 2000; Hashimoto et al., 2004; Csasezar et al., 2009; Vidal-Dupiol et al., 2009) . Additionally, corals contain fluorescent proteins (FPs) (Dove et al., 2001) , which have also been identified as stress response protein because the expression of a GFP-homolog was found to decrease under high temperatures (Smith-Keune and Dove, 2007) . FPs also reduce the photoinhibitory effect of high levels of solar radiation, which in conjunction with thermal stress leads to bleaching (Salih et al., 2000) . Finally, GFP might have the ability to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Bou-Abdallah et al., 2006) . FPs may therefore be possible indicators of the thermal stress within host coral cells.",

This may be in part due to the difficulty of maintaining corals associated with monoclonal Symbiodinium cells of different types for stress exposure experiments. We previously established a model system by infecting aposymbiotic Acropora tenuis primary polyps with a monoclonal population of cultured Symbiodinium cells (Yuyama et al., 2005) . The objective of the present study was to compare the stress response of A. tenuis juveniles harboring different Symbiodinium clades. For this purpose, we infected aposymbiotic A. tenuis juveniles with a monoclonal population of cultured Symbiodinium cells. Two different Symbiodinium types (clades A and D) were used in this study, because we had difficulty to inoculate A. tenuis juvenile polyps with other cultures (clade B, F) or freshly isolated homologous Symbiodinium (clade C) (Yuyama et al., 2005 (Yuyama et al., , 2010 . Changes in the gene expression patterns of FPs as well as FP content in juveniles were studied. Other stress-responsive proteins, including an oxidative stress-responsive protein and an ascorbic acid transporter, were also analyzed.",

We selected four genes of interest from an EST library (Kii et al., 2007) and a high-quality cDNA expression profiling (HiCEP) library (Yuyama et al., 2010) of A. tenuis to investigate their expression analysis. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) coding genes were picked from the EST library and an oxidative stress-responsive protein and SLC23 genes were picked from the HiCEP library. The expression levels of these genes were investigated by real-time PCR, which was performed in triplicate using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the mean values were calculated. The data were analyzed using an ABI StepOne Plus\u00d4 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).

However, few studies have examined the stress responses of a coral associated with different symbiont types at the gene expression level. Recently, Desalvo et al. (2010) conducted stress experiments using fragments from a single colony of Montastraea faveolata containing different symbiont types and found that the host transcriptomic states were more highly correlated with symbiont type than thermal stress. Maintaining adult colonies associated with a known monoclonal population of Symbiodinium is generally difficult because, in many corals, single colonies harbor different types of Symbiodinium. Voolstra et al. (2009) studied gene expression in coral larvae of Acropora palmata and M. faveolata after exposure to Symbiodinium strains with different compatibilities. They found that the host transcriptome remained almost unchanged when colonies were inoculated with competent symbionts, whereas extensive transcriptomic changes were reported for symbionts that failed to establish symbioses. Here, we inoculated juvenile polyps of A. tenuis with monoclonal populations of clade A and D Symbiodinium and compared the expression responses of four stress-related genes to thermal stress. Since A. tenuis adult colonies may have multiple types of Symbiodinium, juvenile polyps inoculated with monoclonal Symbiodinium provide effective experimental system to study how symbiont clade affects stress response of the host coral. This is the first study to show that different symbiont types modulate the host stress response differently at the gene expression level.

For example, Smith-Keune and Dove (2007) showed the downregulation of a GFP-homolog of A. millepora adult colonies at 32 C and 33 C. They suggested that the GFP-homolog can be used as a sensitive marker of heat stress given that the decreased gene expression preceded damage of the photosystem II of algal symbionts, as measured by PAM fluorometry. In addition, Rodriguez-Lanetty et al. (2009) reported that in aposymbiotic larvae of A. millepora, the expression of a fluorescent protein homolog, DsRed-type FP, decreased in response to elevated temperature. They further suggested that DsRed-type FP and the colorless GFP-homolog reported by Smith-Keune and Dove (2007) might be the same. However, we found that the expression patterns of GFP and the RFP-homolog changed in the opposite direction when juveniles associated with different Symbiodinium types were exposed to thermal stress. Despite the lack of biological replicates in this study, the present results suggest that the stress response of the coral is not unidirectional, but that it changes direction depending on the symbiont type. Quantification of the GFP content within the juveniles also revealed that the GFP content increased in response to thermal stress in clade D symbionts harboring juveniles, but not in clade A symbionts harboring juveniles.",

The oxidative stress-responsive protein and the Na \u00fe -dependent ascorbic acid transporter family SLC23 (Takanaga et al., 2004) are potential candidates for stress markers in corals. Ascorbic acid is an effective antioxidant and an essential cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions. Ascorbic acid peroxidase plays a central role in the ascorbic acid/glutathione cycle and is a key enzyme in the reduction of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conversely, other symbiosis-related genes such as those encoding lipase and sulfate transporter were downregulated by thermal stress in juveniles associated with either clade A or clade D symbionts (data not shown).

Palmer et al. (2009) showed that coral FPs exhibited significant H 2 O scavenging activity. These studies suggest that FPs might have antioxidant activity as well as photoprotective functions. If this is the case, different contents of FPs might imply different tolerance against oxidative stress under high temperature. Thus, different expression patterns of FPs in juveniles associated with clade A and clade D symbionts under thermal stress may result in different stress tolerances in these juveniles. However, the present results showed that algal density decreased under thermal stress (32 C, 24 h) in both juveniles associated with clade A and clade D symbionts (Fig. 1) . Further studies are necessary to clarify how GFP gene expression and GFP content affect the stress tolerance of juveniles of the coral. In many corals, distinct morphs are found that differ greatly in their concentration of FPs (Dove et al., 2001) . We observed that the GFP content was higher in juveniles associated with clade D Symbiodinium than those associated with clade A symbionts and that the fluorescence intensity increased significantly at high temperatures in clade D harboring juveniles. These results suggest that the amount of GFP, and hence coral color, might be affected by Symbiodinium types as well as environmental conditions.",

Specifically, gene expression decreased at high temperatures if juveniles were associated with clade A symbionts but increased if they were associated with clade D symbionts. The direction of change in gene expression may depend on the extent of oxidative stress within the cell, and the intracellular oxidative stress of the host cells may vary depending on the symbiont type even when exposed to the same stress conditions. If this is the case, gene expression might be upregulated at low to moderate stress levels but downregulated under conditions of greater stress. Another possibility is that symbionts of different types modulate host gene expression differently by some unknown mechanism. The present results were obtained using juveniles of a coral and further studies are needed to understand how symbiont type affects stress response of adult colonies in the field. The present study highlights the possibility that changes in the expression of stress marker genes may be bidirectional depending on the symbiont type of the coral.",

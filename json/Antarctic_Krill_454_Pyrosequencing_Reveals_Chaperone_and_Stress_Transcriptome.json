    "abstract": "Background: The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a keystone species in the Antarctic food chain. Not only is it a significant grazer of phytoplankton, but it is also a major food item for charismatic megafauna such as whales and seals and an important Southern Ocean fisheries crop. Ecological data suggest that this species is being affected by climate change and this will have considerable consequences for the balance of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Hence, understanding how this organism functions is a priority area and will provide fundamental data for life history studies, energy budget calculations and food web models. Methodology/Principal Findings: The assembly of the 454 transcriptome of E. superba resulted in 22,177 contigs with an average size of 492bp (ranging between 137 and 8515bp). In depth analysis of the data revealed an extensive catalogue of the cellular chaperone systems and the major antioxidant proteins. Full length sequences were characterised for the chaperones HSP70, HSP90 and the super-oxide dismutase antioxidants, with the discovery of potentially novel duplications of these genes. The sequence data contained 41,470 microsatellites and 17,776 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs/ INDELS), providing a resource for population and also gene function studies. Conclusions: This paper details the first 454 generated data for a pelagic Antarctic species or any pelagic crustacean globally. The classical ''stress proteins'', such as HSP70, HSP90, ferritin and GST were all highly expressed. These genes were shown to be over expressed in the transcriptomes of Antarctic notothenioid fish and hypothesized as adaptations to living in the cold, with the associated problems of decreased protein folding efficiency and increased vulnerability to damage by reactive oxygen species. Hence, these data will provide a major resource for future physiological work on krill, but in particular a suite of ''stress'' genes for studies understanding marine ectotherms' capacities to cope with environmental change.",

Whilst these species fascinate the public, they represent the apex of a complex food chain, the keystone species of which is the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba [1] . This shrimp-like crustacean is not only a major prey item for these animals, but is also a significant consumer, grazing on the phytoplankton bloom in the austral summer and on algae under the sea ice in winter. In a more global context, it has been suggested to be the most abundant eukaryotic species in the World's Oceans [2] existing in large schools or swarms with densities that may be between 10,000-30,000 individual animals per square metre [3, 4] . Current catches are 125,000-150, 000 tonnes per year [5] , but at its peak in 1982, krill fisheries comprised 13% of the global annual catches of crustaceans [6] . Hence, E. superba with a circumpolar distribution plays not only a pivotal role in the Antarctic ecosystem, but also significantly impacts on the economy of the Southern Ocean fishing industry [1, 7] .",

More recently, research efforts have also focussed on stock estimates and distributions, again with regard to fisheries exploitation [7] . Whilst catches have remained relatively stable and never reached the maximum TAC (total allowable catch) defined by the regulatory body the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), there is growing concern about decreasing krill stocks and any consequential effects on both the Southern Ocean ecosystem and the fisheries industry [9] .",

The ice provides an essential habitat and food supply via ice algae for these animals over the winter period [10, 12] . The southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean includes the Antarctic Peninsula, which is experiencing some of the most rapid rises in sea water temperature on the planet [13] with a 1uC increase in the surface layers of the Bellingshausen Sea in 50 years [14, 15] and reduced winter sea ice duration [16] . This continued and rapid temperature rise has profound implications, not only for krill stocks, but also for broader food web interactions in the Southern Ocean [10, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and for the fishing industry [7, 9, 23] .",

One of the main drivers for understanding krill biology has been the fisheries' requirements for stock forecasting and conservation measures, but this is now joined by concerns over climate change effects and the requirement to take a more holistic over-view to understand food web structures [7, 24, 25] . However, there is very little knowledge of processes at the tissue, cellular or molecular level. As a consequence, and given the pivotal role of this key species in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, detailed physiological and molecular studies are critical if we are to understand this species and its responses to a changing environment. Such studies would provide fundamental data for a deeper understanding of life histories, as well as important parameters for energy budget calculations and models [26] .",

Therefore cellular, tissue and molecular data can only be derived from either individuals recently sampled from the sea, with the concommitant stresses involved or from laboratory manipulations of aquarium held animal stocks. Hence a fundamental issue for the future progression of these studies will be the linking of laboratory developed assays with wild caught sampling [27, 28] . The physiology of E. superba has been studied in a number of laboratory based experiments for periods of up to 5 months using non-specialised facilities [25, 26, 29] . Some of these studies have highlighted the diversity of problems encountered when working on a pelagic species, such as krill adapted to living in swarms with social aggregations [29, 30] . These studies have emphasized the necessity of understanding stress responses in this species as an a priori to improve experimental protocol and also to provide a baseline laboratory physiological metric for such comparative field sampling [26, 30] as such molecular analyses can provide a more detailed description of animal condition over observational physiology approaches [31] . To date there are only 3095 ESTs from E. superba in the public databases, but the classical ''stress genes'' are largely absent from these gene sets [32, 33] .",

After cleaning the data and removing small reads, 699,248 reads containing 205,888,141 bases with an average read size of 293 bp were entered into Newbler [34] for assembly. These assembled into the 22,177 contigs (261,280 reads) which were used for the further analysis. Because the aim of this project was to conduct a preliminary characterisation of the krill transcriptome, with, as described below, an emphasis on chaperones and stress-related genes for future analyses there was a requirement for longer sequences of good quality which would enable us to distinguish between gene family members. Hence the descriptive analysis presented here utilised only the contigs produced by the assembly. Whilst the singletons potentially contain useful lowly expressed sequences, they also contain a substantial proportion of artefacts derived from cDNA synthesis, sequencing and contamination [35] . However these will be retained within our databases and utilised when more targeted pyrosquencing experiments (using both 454 and short reads) will generate an enlarged transcriptome. The contigs ranged in size from 137 bp to 8515 bp, with an average size of 491.9 bp. 48 contigs were greater than 3kb and 94 contigs comprised more than 300 reads, with the largest contig of 8515 bp comprising the most reads with 740 sequences. Self BLAST of this dataset produced only 625 matches with a value of e 2100 , indicating a low level (,3%) of redundancy in the assembly of the reads. The contigs contained 41,470 repeat sequence motifs in coding and/or UTR regions (microsatellites), of which 339 comprised over 7 exact repeat units (Table S1 ). There were 27,776 SNPs/INDELS present in 3,980 contigs designated as high confidence by the Newbler program (Table S2) , although a further circa 25,000 SNPs were identified at lower confidence level as defined by Newbler [34] Hence these provide significant resources for researchers in allied fields and will fuel investigations into, for example, population structure and gene flow dynamics in this crucial pelagic species.",

Although this seems rather low, the number of matches is higher when compared to those of other non-model marine invertebrates which have recently been subjected to 454 transcriptome analyses (c.f. 12% in the blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, 17% in the Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica and 23.9% in larvae of the coral Acropora millipora [35] [36] [37] . This is due to the phylogenetic position of E. superba within the Arthropoda, a phylum which contains a number of species that have been subjected to whole genome sequencing programmes. The prime example of these is the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the insect vectors of human disease such as Anopheles gambiae (www. vectorbase.org). Of these, the Drosophila genes, in particular, are well annotated (www.flybase.org). However, E. superba is a marine invertebrate and more closely related (within the sub-phylum Eucrustacea, super-order Eucarida) are a number of commercially important seafood species, such as the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon and the fleshy prawn Fenneropenaeus chinensis. These have been subjected to several medium-scale EST projects in the past and comprise the majority of the 33,813 nucleotide entries and 400,793 ESTs for the Eucarida in the public database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (as of 15/ 05/10). BLAST sequence similarity searches against these more morphologically and physiologically similar species produces a greater number of matches (35-43%) ( Table 1 ) and some of these, particularly the immune-related genes, are well annotated and characterised [c.f. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . To date E.superba is poorly represented in the database with only 3095 ESTs [32] [33] , of which over 80% were represented in the transcriptome presented here ( Table 1) . The E. superba mitochondrial genome has been almost completely sequenced on two occasions with the aim of producing markers for exploitation and management of krill fisheries resources [43, 44] . Whilst a previous 454 run on a non-model species, Mytilus galloprovincialis produced enough mitochondrial reads to enable alignment of this new data against the relevant mitochondrial sequence [36] , this was not possible on the krill data, as only 8 mitochondrial genes (cytochrome c oxidase, subunits 1, 2 and 3, ATP synthase subunit 6 and NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1,2,4 and 5) were present in our dataset, which may be due to the fact that non-normalised libraries were produced from a single source of krill material. Sequencing of the transcriptomes of krill subjected to different treatments will almost certainly enhance the identification of mitochondrial genes.",

These most commonly expressed sequences with an associated database match represented a varied mix of functional groups ( Table 2) . The largest contig, with a length of 8515bp also contained the highest number of reads (740). BLAST sequence similarity searching of this contig produced a match with an E-value of 0.0 against the shrimp, Litopenaeus vannemei b-1,3-glucan binding protein (bGBP-HDL) [39] ( Table 2 ). The full length of this 1454 amino acid protein was represented in the krill contig. Not surprisingly, given the E-value, there was strong conservation at the amino acid level with 41.2% identity and 59.4% similarity between the two putative proteins. There was also conservation of the precursor N-terminal domain and processing sites for the mature peptide. However, out of the 4 Oglycosylation and 5 N-glycosylation sites found to be preserved between the two Penaeid shrimp and crayfish bGBP-HDL proteins, only 2 and 1 respectively were present in the krill sequence, indicating potential differences in post translational modification [39] . Functional characterisation of the shrimp protein revealed a dual function: binding of b-glucans trigger the activation of this pattern-recognition protein and the prophenol-oxidase system, which is a central component of the shrimp innate immunity defence system, but bGBP-HDL is also involved in lipid transport [45, 46] . Whilst the definition as to which of these functions predominates is not possible within the confines of this descriptive study, the second most common sequence was fatty acid synthase, a key enzyme in the production of fatty acids. The Antarctic environment is subject to extreme seasonality with huge phytoplankton blooms during the austral summer [47] [48] [49] and strong seasonal physiology is known for many Antarctic species [50, 51] . The krill samples used for this transcriptome were caught during the summer and hence during the period when the animals were taking advantage of the ready food supply to fuel the seasonal increase in metabolism, growth and reproduction [52, 53] . This latter process is also supported by the presence of vitellogenin, a major reproductive protein.",

The relatively high levels of vigilin may potentially be linked to those of vitellogenin, as although it is suggested to play a general role in RNA metabolism [54] , it has been specifically shown to stabilise vitellogenin transcripts in some species [55] . The seemingly odd presence of an apoptosis-related gene (contig19379) is almost certainly linked to the processes involved in ecdysis and moulting. Again, this is a process with increased activity in the austral summer, being linked to nutritional status and environmental conditions [56] . Overall, this initial survey of the pyrosequencing data substantiates a previous molecular study, which indicated that krill sampled in the summer were far more active than those sampled in winter [33] .",

In the cytosol, there are two main pathways involving either HSP70 or prefoldin [61] . The HSP70 route is non-specific, whilst prefoldin seems to specifically act in conjunction with the chaperonin that contains T-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) proteins. In the ER, the route is, again, either via an HSP70 gene family member: BiP (binding protein) or calreticulin/calnexin. Numerous components of all of these chaperone pathways are present in the E. superba dataset. These will be described below, of which, given our research interests, the HSPs will be characterised in most detail.",

Whilst HSP70 is the ''classical'' stress gene, the expression levels and regulation of these gene family members in Antarctic species is of particular interest for two reasons: protein folding is more difficult at low temperatures and in the limited examples studied to date, Antarctic species show enhanced expression of these genes [63] [64] [65] [66] with one adaptation to the cold being the permanent expression of the inducible form in the fish [63, 64, 66] and also the lack of the classical heat shock response (HSR) [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] .",

Ten sequences showed the most sequence similarity to the classic inducible form of HSP70. The alignment of the 9 nonredundant sequences ( Figure S1 ) showed that only contig 02253 was complete. The nucleotide sequence of this contig putatively codes for a protein of 668 amino acids. The percentage identity of the deduced amino acid sequence of contig 02253 compared with orthologues from other crustaceans is very high, between 78-84%, confirming the remarkable conservation of this family. As could be expected, this percentage is even higher when you only consider comparisons within the super order Eucarida (.81%) or outside the class Malacostraca (,79%). More detailed analysis of this full length protein sequence reveals the presence of three signature motifs of the HSP70 family: IDLGTTYSCV (amino acids 9-18), IFDLGGGTFDVSIL (amino acids 196-209), IVLVGGSTRIP-KIQKL (amino acids 334-349). Interestingly, at the C-terminus there are four repetitions of a tetrapeptide sequence (GGMP) ( Figure S1 ). Certain of these repetitive peptides have antigenic properties [70] and are also implicated in the association between HSP70 and HSP90 in a multichaperone complex. The ATP/GTP active site is also identifiable via the motif: AEAYLGAT (amino acids 133-138) and a potential bi-partite nuclear targeting sequence KRKHKKDPADNKR at amino acids 252-264. The terminal sequence motif of the HSP70 family identifies their cellular location, with the EEDV sequence motif at the end of contig 02253 attesting to its cytoplasmic localisation [71] , whereas HDEL and PEAEYEEAKK characterise members localised to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria respectively.",

The differences between these 3 sequences are possibly explained by the multiple origin of the animals used and therefore constitute allelic variants. A fourth sequence, contig 06573, was relatively short (423bp) and closely resembles the previously described contigs. However, it may represent another form due to the signature situated at amino acid 189 (STGQ) ( Figure S1 ). Whilst this sequence is at the end of the read and therefore the quality is less assured, these supplemental amino acids are also present in the HSPs of other crustaceans. For example, there is a short succession of amino acids intercalated at a similar position (amino acid 191 in the alignment in Figure S2 ) in the two HSP70 isoforms of the hydrothermal vent shrimp, Rimicaris exoculata, as well as in the crab, Dromia personata and the oysters Ostrea edulis and Crassostrea gigas ( Figure S2 ). Whether contig 06573 represents a duplication of the HSP70 gene in E. superba is difficult to exactly determine without the full length sequence and extensive PCR amplification between sequence fragments, which is planned in a future study. However, there is evidence of a duplication of HSP70 genes in Antarctic species; in the molluscs Laternula elliptica, Nacella concinna, but also the crustacean Paraceradocus gibber [65, 69, 72] and other crustacean species known by their capacity to respond to thermal shock namely, Rimicaris exoculata [73] , Palaemonetes varians [74] and Macrobrachium rosenbergii [75] amongst others.",

Two cytoplasmic HSP90s exist in human (HSP90 a and b) and have been reported in other vertebrates. In the invertebrates, only one protein form has been characterised, although in Mytilus galloprovincialis it may be the product of either one or two genes [77] and only one form has been cloned in the crustaceans Peneaus monodon and Metapenaeus ensis [78, 79] . Recently, two different HSP90s have been identified in the crab Portunus trituberculatus [80] . Analysis of the two ptHSP90s showed that both were most similar to the vertebrate HSP90a and are the result of a duplication of the orthologous vertebrate HSP90a gene [80] . Comparisons were made between these two crab sequences and the E. superba sequences across a common region of 128 amino acids. EusHSP90-1 shows most similarity to the HSP90-1 of Portunus (86.7% amino acid identity) (79.7% with ptHSP90-2 and 74.2% with EusHSP90-2). Likewise EusHSP90-2 is also most close in terms of identity to ptHSP90-1 (78.1%) than to the second form (76.6%) of ptHSP90.

Hence these molecules are the result of an independent duplication event and the high variability between the paralogues observed in the Euphausia indicate that this phenomenon was very ancient in this taxa. This hypothesis is in accord with the results observed in the Peneids, which at the phylogenetic level are intermediate between the Euphausia and the Brachyura and only appear to have a single HSP90 gene [78, 79] . The HSP90 sequences from a number of invertebrates belonging to the Panarthropoda were aligned ( Figure  S4 ) and show the conservation of the protein in this taxon (Figure 1 ). Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses using the Chelicerate Ixodes scapularis as an outgroup generated congruent trees positioning krill as the sister group of the decapods ( Figure 2 ).

However, this shows considerable differences with EusHSP90-1 (24% identity over the region concerned) and does not contain the cytosolic signature EEVD at the extreme C-terminal. Further analysis of the BLAST results indicated that this sequence is actually more similar to TRAP1 (Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) Receptor-Associated Protein 1) or HSP75, even though some of the database matches have been designated as HSP90 (Aedes aegypti and Culex quiquifasciatus). This example demonstrates some of the confusion over the naming of these genes, as in Homo sapiens, where all of these variant names have now been potentially designated as HSPC5 [57] . The alignment and percentage identity calculation between the putative E. superba sequences and TRAP1/HSP75 genes from different invertebrates and vertebrates showed significant conservation of this molecule in different taxa (Figure 3 and Figure S5 ). This homologue of the HSP90s is localised in the mitochondria [83, 84] . Although the precise function of these molecules is yet to be determined, they are implicated in cellular stress resistance pathways and therefore are involved in the general functioning of the cell cycle, cellular differentiation and apoptosis. It is evident that the mitochondria play an essential role in cellular homeostasis under stressful conditions as well as the control of intracellular Ca 2+ , energy generation and apoptosis (see also section on other identified chaperones including mitochondrial genes). Despite their sequence similarity to the HSP90 genes, the TRAP1 family exhibit significant functional differences [83] . They are particularly studied for their role in cancer defence and represent targets of interest in anti-cancer therapies [85] .",

In addition, a number of other cytosolic chaperones and co-chaperones were present, some of which appear to have mainly chaperone functions (e.g. HSPa4l (contig09322)), whilst others interact with, and control the action of other chaperones. Of particular note were contigs with high sequence similarity to the HSP70 co-chaperones DnaJ, chaperonin (contig 01709) and HSPBP1 (contig06138). This latter protein interacts with HSPA1A, an HSP70 family member and has been shown to inhibit the action of HSPA1A and therefore impact on degradation of target proteins. The DnaJ proteins are an extensive gene family which directly stimulate the ATPase activity of the HSP70 chaperones, but also determine the activity of HSP70s by stabilising their interactions with substrate proteins [89] . All members of this gene family contain a J domain, but they have been divided into 3 main groups depending on what other domains are present in the protein. In humans, so far there have been 4 type A, 14 type B and 22 type C DnaJ proteins described [57] . In the E. superba dataset 18 contigs potentially comprising at least 13 different family members over all three groups were present (Table 4) , indicating a similar complement of these genes in krill compared to vertebrates. Of the full data set, only 2 small heat shock proteins were identified in contigs 05090 and 05374. These are difficult to define as they are not very conserved between species. Finally, three non-overlapping contigs were identified with high sequence similarity to Hop. This is the gene name for the HSC70/HSP90 organising protein and mediates the association between these two chaperones. However, as stated previously, the cytosolic chaperone system with the prevalence of HSP70 gene family members is not the only cellular chaperone system or pathway.",

Although calnexin and calreticulin are some of the most abundant chaperones in the ER, they are either not detected, or present in trace amounts in the BiP complex described above. Evidence suggests that these two networks are spatially separated and that as secreted proteins mature they are transported inside the ER from one network (BiP) onto calnexin/calreticulin [90] . These two genes are putatively represented by a full length contig for calreticulin (00826) and a partial 39 clone (08163) for calnexin. Whilst these two genes share a high degree of amino acid similarity and functionality (Ca 2+ binding, lectin-like activity and recognition of mis-folded proteins), they have distinct cellular localisations which affect their mode and sphere of action. Calnexin is an integral membrane protein, whilst calreticulin is a luminal protein and thus more mobile. In addition to their role as chaperones, they also play a significant role in ER Ca 2+ binding and storage. Hence they are also involved in Ca 2+ homeostasis and ER-dependent Ca 2+ signalling [92] and therefore are potential candidates for understanding responses to stress both in terms of protein turnover, but also cellular signalling.",

In contrast, contig13343, in spite of having an N-terminal ATPase domain, has many amino acid differences with the classical HSP70s and to date, most research has indicated a primary role in the mammalian immune response. Similar to the ER, the mitochondria also has its own chaperone system. Two co-chaperones were putatively identified: HscB (contig 12123) involved in iron-suphur cluster assembly and contig 16412 which showed high sequence similarity to GrpE, the main HSP70 co-chaperone in the mitochondria and equivalent to the cytosolic DnaJ [93] . As regards the main HSP70 family member in this organelle, this is GRP75 (HSPA9) (contig 10241). This protein is not induced by heat, but by other forms of stress e.g. glucose deprivation and oxidative injury.

Hence they are proposed as important multifunctional hubs in cellular networks [97] . As such, even subtle environmental perturbations are proposed as being able to profoundly affect not only chaperone production, but also the functions of the whole cell network [97] . Whilst all major components of the various chaperone systems were identified in this study, despite extensive searches, transcription factors controlling the expression of many of these were not present in the dataset. Sequences with strong sequence similarity to either the Heat Shock Factor (HSF) or the Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) transcription factors were not identified.

In this respect, catalase, a major antioxidant enzyme previously described in the clam [99] is only represented by a single contig (08109) (match: 6.5e 222 ) matching the very 39 end of the gene (from amino acids 425 onwards). This small amount of predicted amino acid sequence does not really allow for effective annotation or comparisons with other species.",

This heteromeric protein comprises 2 subunits: a heavy (H) and a light (L) chain. The heavy chain is ubiquitous and contains the catalytic ferroxidase centre which is responsible for the oxidation of iron and allows iron uptake and release. The light chain is catalytically inactive [100] . The sequence described here is the heavy chain variant, containing the feroxidase motif. In line with previous findings with other crustacean ferritins, the E. superba sequence shares more amino acid sequence identity with the human (53.6%) rather than the Drosophila heavy chain (35.9% identity at the amino acid level) substantiating the theory of differential evolution of the insect ferritins [101] . This protein is well described as being expressed in response to oxidative stress and hypoxia, but interestingly, it has also be shown to be elevated in response to freezing in the marine snail (Littorina littorea) [102] . This may explain the relatively high expression levels in this Antarctic crustacean, although it has also been shown to play an immune role in marine invertebrates [38, 103] .",

The remaining were assigned as cytosolic forms and further designated into putative gene family members, based on sequence similarity searches (Table 6 ). Of the 10 contigs which contained either full length or almost full-length sequences, it was possible to differentiate 8 genes putatively belonging to the omega, sigma, delta, theta and mu families. Of the latter, 4 contigs showed significant matches against the mu family, but three of these (08776, 10471 and 03844) are potentially allelic variants, sharing approximately 85% identity and 93% amino acid similarity. This is in contrast to contig 06543, which also showed sequence similarity to the mu family, but shared only 64.7% identity to the other putative family members and therefore was designated as a separate gene. Previous examination of the E. superba ferritin gene, showed this to be evolutionarily more similar to the vertebrate, than the insect lineage. The reverse is true of the GSTs, with the identification of a putative delta GST. Recently a delta GST has been described in the Chinese mitten crab [107] and the data presented here substantiate these findings that the delta GSTs are also present in the Crustacea and not restricted to the more traditional insect taxonomic groupings.",

Three distinct types have been identified in eukaryotes depending on the metal ions found at the active site: iron SOD (Fe-SOD) (found only in prokaryotes and plants to date), manganese SOD (Mn-SOD) and copper/zinc SOD (Cu,Zn SOD). Surprisingly searches of the E. superba dataset identified 4 putative SOD genes ( Table 7) . Two putative Mn-SOD transcripts were clearly differentiated via the manganese superoxide dismutase signature (DVWHHAYY) and then further defined using BLAST sequence similarity searching into the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms ( Table 7) . Analysis of the Cu,Zn SODs was more complex. An alignment of the two putative Cu,Zn SOD protein sequences from E. superba with those of other Eucrustacea identified the conserved amino acid residues for binding Cu and Zn and the signature motifs of Cu,Zn SODs in both genes (Figure 4 ). There are two forms of this gene documented in a variety of species [110] : an intracellular and an extracellular form [111] . However, the two E. superba sequences did not contain either the consensus header or consensus tail sequences (KAVCVL and GVIGT respectively) associated with the intracellular form [110] . Sequence analysis showed that the two E. superba transcripts shared only 32.9% identity and hence were not the result of alternative splicing, as has been found in Caenorhabditis elegans [112] . Duplicated Cu,Zn SOD variants have been identified in Xenopus laevis [113] , but the genome of this species is known to be tetraploid and hence this situation may not be unexpected. There is very little data on the genome evolution of the Eucrustacea, but, to date, there is no evidence of extra genome duplications in this taxa and therefore the two transcripts in E. superba potentially represent a novel species-specific gene duplication.",

It is suggested that animals living in constant cold temperatures may be more vulnerable to damage by reactive oxygen species, due to slow cell and protein turnover rates and the consequent accumulation of oxidised proteins [99, 114] , however examination of the databases shows a complex pattern of Cu,Zn duplication in the Arthropoda. Bombyx mori, the silk worm, has both intracellular and extracellular Cu,Zn genes. In contrast Culex quinquefasciatus, the Southern house mosquito, has 4 different putative genes for Cu,Zn SOD (B0WC98, B0WNS9, B0X9L3, B0VZ56), all of which are different with the latter two containing the intracellular motifs. The two extracellular variants, only show 17.2% identity and 26.9% similarity at the amino acid level, but do contain the required motifs for Cu,Zn SOD, i.e. duplication of both the intraand extracellular forms. A more complicated story arises with 5 putative genes for SOD in Drosophila sechellia (P61854, B4HNH5, B4HMD6, B4ICF4 and B4HT88). The last accession number describes a Mn-SOD, P61854 is the intracellular form of Cu,Zn SOD whilst the other 3 genes (181, 264 and 270 amino acids respectively) all appear to code for different variants of extracellular Cu,Zn SOD. In the Eucrustacea, to date, only one form of Cu,Zn SOD has been identified with the exception of the sea louse, Caligus clemensi, which has two, but these can be clearly differentiated into an intracellular and extracellular form. In Antarctic marine species, gene duplication events have fuelled adaptations to the cold, particularly in the case of antifreeze proteins [115] and this extra SOD may be another such example.",

Contig15252 was shown to be most similar to a copper transport protein in the Southern house mosquito (Culex quinquifasciatus) (accession number: B0X8C6). Also two contigs (02344 and 02345) comprised non-overlapping clones with sequence similarity to the ER localised hypoxia upregulated protein (Hyou1). Whilst this latter protein is a member of the HSP70 family and therefore may play function as a molecular chaperone and participate in protein folding, its critical role is thought to be cryoprotection triggered by oxygen deprivation. Signature motifs for Cu-Zn superoxide dismutases are indicated by the blue lines under the consensus. The four amino acid residues required for binding copper and four amino acids required for binding zinc are indicated by arrows, as well as two cysteines residues (SS) for the disulphide bridge [110] . Putative N-glycosylation sites for contig03139 only are indicated by the red lines under the consensus and the predicted signal peptide (again for contig03139 only) is marked in italics and underlined.

The most highly expressed genes are concerned with lipid and seasonal metabolism. However, the classical ''stress proteins'', such as HSP70, HSP90, ferritin and GST are also highly expressed, which lead us to carry out an extensive characterisation of both the cellular chaperone system and the major antioxidant proteins ( Figure 5 ). Knowledge of these gene networks is particularly pertinent in the study of Antarctic marine species in terms of both their adaptations to living in an extreme environment, but also to their responses to climate change. In a recent study on the transcriptomes of Antarctic notothenioid fish 177 protein families were shown to be over-expressed compared with temperate relatives, many of these were genes involved in protein biosynthesis, protein folding, lipid metabolism and antioxidants [116] , similar to Figure 5 . Summary of most highly expressed chaperone and ''stress'' transcripts in E. superba. Picture of E. superba from the Bellingshausen Sea continental shelf, taken onboard RRS James Clark Ross cruise JR230 (benthic pelagic coupling cruise) by Pete Bucktrout (British Antarctic Survey). Gene names in red = 400+ copies in the transcriptome data, Green = 200-400 gene copies and blue = less than 200 gene copies. Genes labelled (i) and (ii) plus boxed in the diagram are duplicated genes and their analysis fully described in the main text. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0015919.g005 those described in this paper. These were hypothesized as required adaptations to living in the cold and validate some of the proposed costs of living in such an environment, such as decreased protein folding efficiency [117] and increased vulnerability to damage by reactive oxygen species [99] .",

                "text": "As more Antarctic transcriptomes become available it will be possible to determine how wide-spread altered expression patterns, gene duplication events and even altered cellular networks are in Southern Ocean or indeed, polar animals. E. superba is a pelagic species and experimental work is always limited by availability and ship time. The mere act of recovering the animals from the sea via trawls is stressful and it will always be difficult to partition the stress effects of the sampling regime from the experimental changes to the transcriptome. As such, there is a need to identify not only the stress response, but also the trade-offs associated with enhanced ''stress gene'' production. It is already known that some Antarctic species permanently express the inducible form of HSP70 as well as other HSP70 family members [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] . In more experimentally amenable species it has been shown that there is a demonstrable energetic cost associated with the production of heat shock proteins [118] and as yet we have no knowledge of the effect of this in terms of altered transcription patterns in Antarctic species or how it will affect their response to climate change effects. Is the stenothermal nature of Antarctic marine species solely a result of adaptation to living in a cold constant environment for so long, or is it a trade-off effect of survival? Recent large-scale EST and 454 studies [37, 116] and the data described here, are starting to provide the building blocks towards more detailed studies across a range of Antarctic species with the ultimate aim of providing ecosystem level answers to the costs of life in the cold.",

All of the krill were taken by target fishing, mainly using a pelagic net (RMT8), based on observations of krill swarms using an EK60 echo sounder at 38 and 120KHz. The nets were towed for only a short time and, after hauling, the krill were transferred as quickly as possible to the cold room at 1-3uC for sorting. Catches were made at different times of the day (00:50, 06:00, 07:00, 14:00 and 20:30) and samples flash frozen before being stored at 280uC. RNA was isolated from whole animals using the RNeasy system with on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen) according to manufacturers instructions. RNA was initially qualified using a standard spectrophotometer and a pool of 6 animals prepared for library production. 1.5mg of pooled sample of krill total RNA was used for the library production, with the RNA purity additionally checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer. The cDNA library was constructed using the Creator TM SMART TM kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). In brief, total RNA was reverse transcribed to first stand cDNA coupled with (dC) tailing and CDS III primers (both containing SfiI digestion site sequences) following a step of template switching and extension by reverse transcription. The second strand cDNAs were then amplified using long-distance PCR with Advantage 2 PCR enzyme system (Clontech Laboratories Inc.). The quality of cDNAs was then visually checked by loading the cDNAs on a 1.1% agarose gel. The cDNAs were then purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The second strand cDNAs (5 mg) were then subjected to sequencing library construction and pyrosequencing using GS FLX Titanium system (Roche applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation centre (Montreal, QC, Canada) using the standard GS FLX protocol.",

Such applications have been greatly facilitated by the ability to label the protein of interest genetically with fluorescent proteins from jellyfish or coral (6) (7) (8) . This method overcomes many of the difficulties associated with chemical modification, including yield, selectivity, and the need to modify proteins in vitro (9) . However, the size of naturally occurring fluorescent proteins (\u03fe20 kDa) limits the resolution of distance measurements, and in many cases it represents a significant structural perturbation to the protein under study. Moreover, the fluorophore typically can be introduced only at the C or N terminus of a protein, and it is relatively insensitive to the local environment.",

                "text": "The use of small synthetic dyes allows investigation of local changes in distance or polarity with high precision and without significant structural perturbation of the protein. Nevertheless, most reactive dyes must be introduced into the protein in vitro, they exhibit relatively low chemoselectivity, and they are often limited to accessible positions at the protein surface (9) . Moreover, mutagenesis of the target protein is often required to generate unique sites for derivatization. Recently, strategies have been developed to label proteins with small fluorescent dyes in vivo. One of these methods makes use of cell-permeant, biarsenic dyes that bind to their target protein through two arsenic-dithiol interactions (10) . Another approach exploits a biotin ligase that recognizes a hydrazide-reactive ketone substrate that can be attached to a 15-mer acceptor peptide and subsequently linked to a hydrazide-derivatized fluorophore (11) . It has also been shown that a highly promiscuous O 6alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase, fused to a protein of interest, can be labeled by fluorescent O 6 -benzylguanosine derivatives (12) . However, all of these approaches rely on the introduction of specific dye-acceptor motifs, peptides or proteins that restrict the sites of modification and can introduce undesired structural perturbations into the protein to be analyzed. Finally, in vitro mutagenesis with suppressor tRNAs chemically modified with fluorescent amino acids can be used to label proteins with fluorescent probes site-specifically, but this method is largely limited to in vitro systems affording small quantities of proteins (13) (14) (15) (16) .",

To encode this amino acid in yeast genetically, a previously reported Escherichia coli amber suppressor tRNA\u035eleucyl-tRNA synthetase pair (tRNA CUA Leu5 \u035eLeuRS) was used. This pair is orthogonal in yeast, i.e., tRNA CUA Leu5 does not crossreact with any of the endogenous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and LeuRS does not accept any endogenous tRNAs as substrates. This pair has been used to incorporate a number of structurally diverse amino acids into proteins with high fidelities and good efficiencies in yeast (19) .",

These amino acids form a hydrophobic pocket around one \u2425-methyl group of leucine in the x-ray crystal structure of the homologous Thermus thermophilus LeuRS (Fig. 1B) (20) . Because this binding pocket largely consists of side-chain atoms, mutations might be expected to accommodate novel amino acid substrates without significant perturbation of the LeuRS polypeptide backbone. To evolve a LeuRS specific for 1, a selection scheme was used in which the codons for Thr-44 and Arg-110 of the gene for the transcriptional activator GAL4 were both converted to amber nonsense codons (TAG) (21) . Suppression of these amber codons in the MaV203:pGADGAL4(2TAG) yeast strain leads to production of functional full-length GAL4, which drives expression of genomic HIS3 and URA3 reporter genes. These genes complement histidine and uracil auxotrophy, allowing clones harboring active synthetase mutants that aminoacylate endogenous amino acids or 1 to be positively selected on synthetic dropout (SD) medium (containing dextrose) supplemented with 1 mM 1. Negative selection of synthetases that accept endogenous amino acids is carried out by growth on SD medium lacking 1 but containing 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid, which is converted into a toxic product by the URA3 gene product (21, 22) .",

Recent structural and biochemical studies have shown that hydrolysis of a cognate activated or charged leucine at this site is prevented by steric repulsion between one or more active-site amino acids and a \u2425-methyl group of leucine. Mutation of one such residue, Thr-252, to alanine (T252A) results in efficient hydrolysis of aminoacylated tRNA Leu (23, 24) . Consequently, to enhance fidelity of LeuRSB8, the T252A mutation was introduced (LeuRSB8T252A). Analysis of the suppression efficiency with hSOD-33TAG-His revealed relatively low yields of protein in the presence of [0.29 mg\u035eliter hSOD-33TAG-His 6 harboring 1 after nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) purification]. However, the T252A mutation resulted in a marked reduction of hSOD expression in the absence of 1. Previous studies of the suppression efficiency of an amber suppressor E. coli tRNA Tyr \u035eTyrRS pair in yeast indicated that suppressor tRNA levels can limit overall protein yields (S.C., unpublished results). To increase tRNA expression, three copies of tRNA CUA Leu5 with flanking regions from yeast suppressor tRNA SUP4, which are known to contain an RNA polymerase (pol) III promoter, were inserted into the plasmid pLeuRSB8T252A (25, 26) . These multiple tRNA genes were placed under the control of an additional phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) promoter, resulting in an \u03f74-fold enhancement (1.11 mg\u035eliter) of expression of hSOD harboring 1 at position 33 ( Fig. 2A) .

To demonstrate the utility of dansylamino acid in studies of protein structure and function, it was used as an environmentally sensitive reporter of protein unfolding (13, 17, 18) . hSOD has a Greek-key \u2424-barrel fold with an external loop and short helical regions at one barrel face near the active site, which contains the copper and zinc ions (27) . Loop IV of this region is additionally connected by a disulfide bond (Cys-57 and Cys-146) to \u2424-strand 8 of the barrel (Fig. 3) . Monomeric hSOD has been shown to undergo reversible and complete unfolding in the concentration range 0-3.5 M guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) (28) . To analyze local changes in the barrel core and outer rim regions during unfolding, 1 was incorporated at two different positions, Gln-16 and Trp-33 ( Fig. 3) . Position 33 lies on the barrel at the center of \u2424-strand 3, the first N-terminal strand of Greek-key 1 (27) ; surface residue Gln-16 forms the N-terminal tip of \u2424-strand 2 adjacent to Greek-key \u2424-strand 3. When 1 was incorporated at positions 16 and 33 in hSOD, the fluorescence intensity increased slightly at both positions (11% and 3% for positions 16 and 33, respectively). The max of 1 also blueshifted compared with the free amino acid (\u03f714 nm and 27 nm for positions 16 and 33, respectively). These spectral changes likely reflect partial shielding by surface side chains or dielectric differences between bulk water and the protein hydration shell. GdmCl denaturation only weakly affected the emission intensity and wavelength of the Gln-16 3 1 mutant ( Fig. 4 A, C, and D) . However, increasing the GdmCl concentration from 0 to 5 M caused a significant redshift in the max (528-544 nm) and decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the Trp-33 1 mutant (Fig 4 B-D) . The most striking effects were observed at low GdmCl concentrations (0-1.5 M) followed by moderate changes from 1.5 M to 3.5 M GdmCl and a relatively small change between 3.5 M and 5 M GdmCl (Fig. 4) . These results suggest that relatively large environmental changes occur at position 33 during protein unfolding. Previous NMR studies have revealed transitions from the native state to intermediate states of similar structure at 0-0.5 M GdmCl and a subsequent complete transition to an unfolded state at 3.5 M. At 2 M GdmCl, the intermediate states and the unfolded state are present in a 1:1 ratio, whereas only the unfolded state is present at \u03fe3.5 M GdmCl. Changes in 1 H- 15 N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation NMR spectra indicate that the loop regions and \u2424-strand 3 are the first to be affected at low concentrations (0.5 M), whereas other \u2424-strands are affected only at higher concentrations (28) . The observed spectral response of 1 at position 33 corresponds well with these findings. In contrast, the fluorescence of mutant protein with 1 at position 16 did not show a large response to unfolding, indicating low changes in local dielectric during structural transitions near this side chain. Removal of copper and zinc ions or reduction of the disulfide bridge resulted in similar unfolding behavior at sites 16 and 33. These studies demonstrate that unnatural amino acid 1 provides a useful probe of structural transitions at defined sites in proteins.",

The T252A mutation was introduced by using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) with primers LRST252AFwd (5\u0408-ACA CTA CCC GCC CGG ACG CGT TTA TGG GTT GTA CCT A-3\u0408) and LRST252ARev (5\u0408-TAG GTA CAA CCC ATA AAC GCG TCC GGG CGG GTA GTG T-3\u0408).",

                "text": "Vector Construction. Vector pLeuRSB8T252A\u0408 was constructed as follows. E. coli tRNA CUA Leu5 and its flanking sequences were assembled by overlap PCR with the following primers (1Fwd, 5\u0408-ATC CCG ACC GGT AAG CTG CTA GCC TCT TTT TC-3\u0408; 1Rev, 5\u0408-GAA GAA AGA GTA TAC TAC ATA ACA CAT ATA CAA TTG AAA AAG AGG CTA GC-3\u0408; 2Fwd, 5\u0408-GTA TAC TCT TTC TTC AAC AAT TAA ATA GCC CGG ATG GTG GAA TCG GTA GA-3\u0408; 2Rev, 5\u0408-CAG CGC GAA CGC CGA GGG ATT TAG AAT CCC TTG TGT CTA CCG ATT CCA CC-3\u0408; 3Fwd, 5\u0408-TCG GCG TTC GCG CTG TGC GGG TTC AAG TCC CGC TCC GGG TAT TTT TTT GT-3\u0408; 3Rev, 5\u0408-CGG CTC TAG ACA TAA AAA ACA AAA AAA TAC CCG-3\u0408). The 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 sequences are identical to the flanking sequences of yeast suppressor tRNA gene SUP4, which is known to contain a pol III promoter (25, 26) . This combined tRNA CUA Leu5 -SUP4 sequence was digested with AgeI and XbaI and repetitively inserted into the AgeI\u035eNheI sites of vector pLeuRSB8T252A to yield three copies of this gene in one direction in the same vector. Subsequently, a PCR DNA fragment including the 650-bp upstream sequence of yeast PGK1 ORF was inserted into the AgeI\u035eNheI site to introduce an additional pol II promoter for transcription of the tRNA region. Vectors pC1SOD-33TAG-His 6 and pC1SOD-16TAG-His 6 were constructed as follows. S. cerevisiae strain 208708 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. This strain produces Cu\u035eZn SOD from a 2-m leu2-d plasmid. This plasmid was extracted, and a BamHI restriction fragment of \u03f72 kb containing the SOD gene was gel purified and inserted into the BamHI site of pBKJYRS; the larger BamHI fragment was recircularized to produce plasmid pC1. A gene encoding His -tagged hSOD with or without an amber codon at position 33 was used to replace the NcoI\u035eSalI fragment of SOD in pBKJYRS. The amber mutation 16TAG was introduced by using the QuikChange method with primers Q16TAGF (5\u0408-GAA GGG TGA CGG CCC AGT TTA GGG TAT TAT TAA CTT CGA GCA GAA G-3\u0408) and Q16TAGR (5\u0408-CTT CTG CTC GAA GTT AAT AAT ACC CTA AAC TGG GCC GTC ACC CTT C-3\u0408). The resulting pBKSOD plasmids were digested with BamHI and inserted into pC1 to give pC1SOD-33TAG-His 6 and pC1SOD-16TAG-His 6 . These plasmids were transformed into the MJY125-derived strain SCY4 (MATa, ade2-101, ura3-1, leu2-3,112, trp1, his3-11, \u232cCYB2::kan [cir 0 ]) by a lithium acetate method and plated on SD medium (\u03ealeucine). Plasmids pLeuRSB8, pLeuRSB8T252A, and pLeuRSB8T252A\u0408 were transformed into the obtained strains by using a lithium acetate method and plated on SD medium (\u03ealeucine, \u03eatryptophan).",

A Nicotiana hybrid (Nicotiana. tabacum \u00d7 Nicotiana glauca) shows limited male fertility and could be used as a bioconfined PMP platform. Effective assessment of gene flow from these plants is augmented with methods that utilize fluorescent proteins for transgenic pollen identification. Results: We report the generation of a pollen tagging system utilizing an orange fluorescent protein to monitor pollen flow and as a visual assessment of transgene zygosity of the parent plant. This system was created to generate a tagged Nicotiana hybrid that could be used for the incidence of gene flow. Nicotiana tabacum 'TN 90' and Nicotiana glauca were successfully transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens to express the orange fluorescent protein gene, tdTomato-ER, in pollen and a green fluorescent protein gene, mgfp5-er, was expressed in vegetative structures of the plant. Hybrids were created that utilized the fluorescent proteins as a research tool for monitoring pollen movement and gene flow. Manual greenhouse crosses were used to assess hybrid sexual compatibility with N. tabacum, resulting in seed formation from hybrid pollination in 2% of crosses, which yielded non-viable seed. Pollen transfer to the hybrid formed seed in 19% of crosses and 10 out of 12 viable progeny showed GFP expression. Conclusion: The orange fluorescent protein is visible when expressed in the pollen of N. glauca, N. tabacum, and the Nicotiana hybrid, although hybrid pollen did not appear as bright as the parent lines. The hybrid plants, which show limited ability to outcross, could provide bioconfinement with the benefit of detectable pollen using this system.

Previous investigations have ascertained the utility of gene flow tracking with fluorescent proteins (FPs) [1] [2] [3] [4] . These studies have shown that green fluorescent protein (GFP) is an effective tool for the purpose of gene flow tracking and can be targeted to various organs and tissues within plants, including pollen. This technology, in effect, could be used in an environmental monitoring system, one of the many uses of FPs in plants [5] . One drawback of using native GFP as a marker in plants is the signal-to-noise ratio at GFP's maximum excitation wavelength of 395 nm, often resulting in autofluorescence of plant tissue components [6] . Fluorescent proteins emitting in the red/orange spectrum that require longer wavelengths for excitation have lower levels of autoflorescence in plant tissues compared to blue or UV light [6] . One such widely used orange fluorescent protein (OFP), DsRed, is derived from Discosoma sp. its mutant variants have higher extinction coefficients and quantum yields [7] . Coral-derived FPs should be useful for monitoring gene flow.",

Long-range pollen tracking was conducted in canola species to assay pollen movement in real time (e.g. immediate detection of tagged pollen) using traps at various distances within field and greenhouse experiments. This method is quicker and less laborious for determining pollen flow than analyzing progeny from recipient plants (e.g. antibiotic screening, PCR, FP screening) [8] . Drawing upon this previous body of work, it is logical to conceptualize a method to determine bioconfinement efficacy using FP tagging utilizing an improved fluorescent protein for plants.",

Recently, we have shown that GFP tagging in vegetative plant tissues of this hybrid allows for gene tracking and assists with sterility assessments [9] . Here we describe a modified system to tag pollen that is applicable to a realtime assay of pollen flow from FP-tagged plants. Our goal was to engineer each Nicotiana species for pollenspecific expression of an OFP gene that also had vegetative tissues that expressed a GFP gene. The transgenic plants could then be crossed to obtain interspecific hybrid Nicotianas that had FP genes contributed from each parent. To achieve this goal, parent plants N. tabacum 'TN 90' and N. glauca were Agrobacterium-mediated transformed to synthesize the OFP tdTomato-ER in the pollen and bred to homozygosity, and then crossed to create the transgenic interspecific hybrid. Manual greenhouse crosses were performed to assess sexual compatibility and functionality of the system. ",

The mgfp5-er gene encodes a GFP that emits green light (\u03bb max = 509 nm) when excited by wavelengths of blue (465 nm) or ultraviolet (UV; 395 nm) light and targeted and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within cells. GFP in transgenic plants is observable by UV light illumination in the dark or epifluorescence microscopy, and is quantifiable using fluorescence spectrometry [10, 11] . tdTomato-ER, is a DsRed variant that is a tandem dimer OFP (\u03bb max = 581 nm and excited by green light (554 nm) that is also retained in the ER [7, 12] . To create dual FP marker vectors, the Gateway compatible vector backbone pMDC99, containing a hygromycin resistance cassette, and pMDC100, containing a kanamycin resistance cassette, were utilized as Gateway destination vectors [13] . An entry vector containing a pollen-specific promoter, LAT52 [14] , driving expression of the OFP tdTomato-ER and a nos terminator was recombined with the destination vectors, creating the intermediate vectors pMDC99-tdTomato-ER and pMDC100-tdTomato-ER. Subsequently a GFP expression cassette (containing CaMV35S-mGFP5-ER-nosT) was amplified from pBIN19-mGFP5-ER and cloned into the intermediate vectors, creating the binary vectors TD-GFP-H (containing hygromycin selection) and TD-GFP-K (containing kanamycin selection), respectively ( Figure 1 ). These vectors were identical except for the antibiotic resistance genes to facilitate screening by using dual antibiotic selection after hybridization of Nicotiana species to incorporate both constructs into the F hybrid.",

Many of the immature pollen grains apparently did not synthesize sufficient tdTomato-ER for visual detection. The FP was only obvious in larger, more mature hybrid OFP pollen and did not appear to fluoresce as brightly as TN 90 TD-GFP-K and N. glauca TD-GFP-H. The pollenspecific promoter LAT52, regulates gene expression during microspore mitosis, allowing transcription until Figure 4 Average relative fluorescence intensity for N. glauca TD-GFP-K T 1 lines. Leaf tissue from a non-transgenic N. glauca line and eight transgenic T 1 lines were excited at 395 nm and measured at an emission of 509 nm with a spectrofluorometer. Fluoresence intensity values were normalized to an average measurement of N. glauca negative control plants outside the spectral range of GFP emission. For N. glauca n = 2, TD-GFP-K lines 1 n = 26, line 2 n = 34, line 3 n = 31, line 4 n = 16, lines 5 and 6 n = 33, line 7 n = 28, and line 8 n = 24. Error bars represent the standard error from the mean and different letters indicate significant differences at P < 0.05. a Crosses listed by (female \u2640 \u00d7 male \u2642). b Refers to numbers of each plant used in crosses with respect to the plant order in the genotypes column. 12 crosses were attempted between each pair of plants, except one pair of hybrid OFP and SN 2108 where 11 crosses were made. c A 'cross' is constituted by a pollen transfer from one plant to the flower of another plant.",

Fluorescently-tagged pollen is highly distinguishable from non-tagged pollen, and shows low autofluorescence. The plants produced in this study further increase the number of tools available for gene flow studies. Crossing studies demonstrated that hybrid OFP plants had low fertility and provided bioconfinement by limiting successful crosses made to the maternal line, N. tabacum. As pollen tracking is possible with this fluorescently tagged hybrid, more research is needed to determine the efficacy of pollen detection with this system and how it relates to bioconfinement in a field setting.",

N. glauca and TN 90 plants have been bred for homozygosity of tdTomato-ER, resulting in hybrid OFP plants. All white light images (A), (C), (E), (G), and (I) were captured at 80 ms exposure time. Panels (B), (D), (F), (H), and (J) are epifluorescent microscopy images using green light excitation and orange light emission. Panels (B) and (D) were captures at 50 ms exposure time. Panels (F) and (H) were captured at 80 ms exposure time. Panel (J) was captured at 180 ms exposure time."

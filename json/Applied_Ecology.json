BIOREMEDIATION Chances are, if one were to ask a group of environmental engineers to define \"environmental biotechnology,\" there would be agreement among them that it has to do with putting biology to work to treat pollutants. Biotechnologists might agree, but may emphasize the \"technology\" over the \"environment\" in the application. Many scientists and engineers who apply life science principles will enthusiastically agree with the two quotes above. The bioengineer may also add that the field is more inclusive than simply solving problems, but also would use living organisms to find better ways to prevent pollution, such as innovative, green technologies like harnessing algae as energy sources. Certainly, all of these statements are correct, but none completely characterizes \"environmental biotechnology.\" The environmental engineering community may limit the use of the term \"environmental biotechnology\" to apply exclusively to microbes (although, they would also likely appreciate the role of plants in phytoremediation). Indeed, some engineers consider environmental biotechnology to fall completely within the domain of microbial ecology [67,69]. Microbial communities are able to degrade and detoxify contaminants in any environmental media, most commonly in water and soil, but also in sediment and biosolids (i.e., sludge). They can also convert the various organic compounds to compounds that can be more readily used to produce energy, e.g., methane (CH) [68]. These results are generally achieved via microbial metabolism, especially catalyzed redox reactions.

Most engineering texts are devoted to applications of sciences, so it should come as no surprise that the likelihood is fairly strong that a book pulled from the library shelf with \"environmental biotechnology\" in its title will largely if not exclusively deal in applications involving the degradation of pollutants. Although most bioengineering and scientific literature does indeed focus on the environmental applications of microbial ecology and biotechnologxy, the systems view requires that both the environmental applications and the environmental implications be considered together.

When these found their way to soil and water, they presented major challenges to treatment, because the microbes had not previously come into contact with these compounds, so their ordinary metabolic processes of oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and other mechanisms lacked the ability to degrade these more complex chemical compounds. Sanitary engineering pioneers, such as Ross McKinney at the University of Kansas, knew that microbes are highly adaptive, especially in conditions of food scarcity and stress. Microbes (often soil bacteria, e.g., Pseudomonas spp.) became acclimated to various chemicals by withholding their ordinary food sources, requiring the microbes to adapt their own metabolic processes to make use of the previously unknown chemicals. Thus, the natural \"pollution controls\" provided by native microbial populations were adequate to deal with waste products under historical conditions. That is, the systems were not yet overwhelmed by amount and type of pollutant. The capacity began to be exceeded as the amounts increased exponentially as a result of industrialization and urbanization, and with increasingly complex molecules entering the environment as either intentionally synthesized as consumer products and drugs or emissions from combustion and other industrial and urban processes [73] .",

More persistent compounds will require intensive treatment systems that enhance the degradation either chemically or microbiologically by bacteria, including species of Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Mycobacterium.

When operating effectively, cells are the factories that turn nutrients and energy into biomass through the processes of photosynthesis, metabolism, and ion exchanges in microbes and plants.

In fact, one of the key indicators of an environmental system's conditions is the availability of ample O 2 concentrations. When O 2 concentrations are depleted, the system becomes anoxic and less capable of sustaining diverse populations. Like other types of pollution, oxygen depletion can be direct or indirect. Some agents elicit direct toxic responses; however, certain contaminants are particularly harmful because they use up resources in the environment at the expense of other organisms. So, it is important to systematically consider rising and falling O 2 levels. Microbes are directly and indirectly involved in changing oxygen budgets in all environmental systems. That is, the available molecular oxygen determines abundance and diversity of microbial populations, which in turn use oxygen as a function of the metabolic processes, which affect the overall diversity, productivity, and sustainability of an ecosystem or the health of the organism in which the microorganisms reside.",

For example, lowering dissolved O 2 in surface waters will first adversely affect more sensitive aquatic species, such as trout, salmon, and other game fish. The lower O 2 concentrations may actually benefit \"rough\" fish like carp and buffalo until the waters are almost completely devoid of dissolved O 2 . Effects also vary according to life stages. Often, at lower oxygen levels, mature fish may live but not be able to reproduce effectively. Figure 7 .3 shows that the combination of vulnerabilities during these different life stages will determine the ability of an aquatic population to thrive, or at least survive (in this instance, in saltwater). For example, below 4 mg L \u00c01 dissolved O 2 an adult trout may not suffer acute effects, but trout larvae or young-of-the-year fish may not survive. Dissolved oxygen (DO) criteria apply to both continuous and cyclically depressed oxygen levels. If O 2 concentrations are continuously above the chronic criterion for growth (4.8 mg L \u00c01 ), the aquatic life at that location should not be harmed. When dissolved oxygen conditions at a site fall below the juvenile/adult survival criterion (2.3 mg L \u00c01 ), oxygen is insufficient to protect aquatic organisms. Thus, when conditions lead to persistently depressed oxygen levels, the DO concentrations will fall between the growth and survival levels. The duration and intensity of these depressed oxygen levels requires ongoing monitoring and, when necessary, actions may need to be taken to ensure that the aquatic ecosystem remains healthy [4] . Actions may include mechanical methods, e.g., aeration fountains, and decreasing the allowable amounts of oxygen-depleting compounds in effluents reaching the water body. It should be noted that even at very low O 2 concentrations, there may be sufficiently high amounts to elicit biodegradation. For example, in subsurface soils, recent studies have indicated that contaminant biodegradation is occurring aerobically at O 2 concentrations previously thought to be too low for such remediation. Thus, the so-called \"two-category\" model of oxic/anoxic conditions is likely too simple for real-world applications, because it requires a threshold O 2 concentration above which aerobic biodegradation is supported by electron-donor contaminants (e.g., petroleum-derived hydrocarbons), and below which anaerobic bacteria degraded electron-acceptor contaminants (e.g., chlorinated ethenes). There is a concentration at which both processes occur simultaneously [61] .",

As they studied these processes, they realized that various genera of microbes had the ability to use detritus on forest floors, suspended organic material in water, and organic material adsorbed onto soil particles as sources of energy need for growth, metabolism, and reproduction. The engineers correctly hypothesized that a more concentrated system could be fabricated to do the same thing with society's organic wastes. Thus, trickling filters, oxidation ponds, landfills, and other wastewater and solid waste treatment systems are merely supercharged versions of natural systems (see Discussion Box: Landfill Bioreactors).",

                "text": "No matter where one lives in most of the world, chances are good that a pile of solid waste is nearby. Greater than 230 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) is generated in the United States annually, of which 57 percent reaches an MSW landfill [75] . Most of the MSW landfills currently in service are regulated under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, mainly to minimize risk to human health and the environment. Much of the potential risk from MSW landfills results from the migration of contaminated leachate and landfill gas (LFG). Thus, bioengineers are challenged to address contamination in two phases, liquid and solid, which are transported offsite by advection and other processes (see Table 2 .9). In North America, landfill regulations call for a system that minimizes liquid infiltration into the solid waste mass by controlling the amount of moisture allowed into these landfills. These so-called \"dry tomb\" landfill designs produce strata within the bioreactor system with low moisture content. Although this decreases the amount of leachate, it also severely limits biodegradation, because moisture is a limiting factor for biofilm production and microbial metabolism. Thus, the likelihood of undegraded contaminants increases, as does their associated risk because the exposure integration time is protracted. These exposures include emissions from fugitive dust, combustion from the flare, microbial releases, and the migration of contaminants through soil, groundwater, and surface waters. This is the rationale for long-term monitoring around these sites, e.g., current regulations require leachate and LFG emissions to be monitored for at least 30 years after closure of a landfill site or even longer if there is reason to believe the risks continue after that time.",

That is, the age of the waste will affect the amount of oxidation ereduction, pH, and other important environmental conditions within each of the landfill's cells. As can be seen in Figure 7 .7, the different landfill stabilization phases often overlap and can be viewed with regard to each phase's role within the system. The initial phase results in aerobic decomposition followed by four stages of anaerobic degradation. Thus, the majority of landfill decomposition by 6 Dissolved oxygen sag curve downstream from an oxygen-depleting contaminant source. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in Curve A remains above 0, so although the available oxygen is reduced, the system remains aerobic. Curve B sags where dissolved oxygen falls to 0, and anaerobic conditions result and continue until the DO concentrations begin to increase. D S is the background oxygen deficit before the pollutants enter the stream. D 0 is the oxygen deficit after the pollutant is mixed. D is the deficit for contaminant A which may be measured at any point downstream. This indicates both distance and time of microbial exposure to the source.

Also, the microbial environment must be habitable for the microbes to thrive. Sometimes, concentrations of compounds can be so high that the environment is toxic to microbial populations.

Commonly used groundwater treatment approaches include air stripping, filtering with granulated activated carbon (GAC), and air sparging. Air stripping transfers volatile compounds from water to air (see Figure 7 .10). Groundwater is allowed to drip downward in a tower filled with a permeable material through which a stream of air flows upward. Another method bubbles pressurized air through contaminated water in a tank. The air leaving the tank (i.e., the off-gas) is treated by removing gaseous pollutants. Filtering groundwater with GAC entails pumping the water through the GAC to trap the contaminants. In air sparging, air is pumped into the groundwater to aerate the water.

Other times, special targeted and cultivated strains, including genetically modified microorganisms, with known abilities to degrade certain compounds, are injected into contaminated soil and groundwater. Many bioremediation experts favor biostimulation over bioaugmentation because almost every subsurface, indigenous microbial species has likely already developed enzyme production systems that will break down the contaminants.

This type of remediation stimulates the growth and metabolism of aerobic bacteria in contaminated soil by applying a vacuum at depth underground. Holes are drilled around the perimeter of contamination. Air is pulled from the surface to the lower pressure zone created by the vacuum pump, and flows through the contaminated soil. If the organic contaminants have a sufficiently high vapor pressure (i.e., volatile organic compounds), they will be pulled from the vadose (unsaturated) zone of soil or other unconsolidated matter, will flow upward and will enter a chamber in which the vapors are treated. Obviously, the two limiting factors for bioventing are the vapor pressure of the contaminants and the permeability of the soil. Another variation is biosparging, wherein air is pumped into and through groundwater in the saturated zone to enhance volatilization and biodegradation.",

Numerous factors may account for why bioremediation does not follow the theoretical decay expected if degradation depended only on total concentration of the contaminant chemical species. Microbial populations not only must degrade soil concentrations that are (readily) available to the microbes, but also the water-borne fraction (e.g., in the water-filled pore spaces of the soil and unconsolidated media). For nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs), which comprise many of the organic contaminants, much of the contaminant is not in a soluble form. Many contaminants have strong affinity for soil particles due to their sorption coefficients, so they resist diffusion. They may also be physically encapsulated within the soil matrices. The bioengineer may need to consider conditioning the soil and pore water (e.g., with surfactants) to overcome some of these factors that limit contact between microbes and chemical contaminants. Figure 7 .14 illustrates an idealized biodegradation growth curve, which has well-defined stages. The extent and duration of each stage will of course vary according to the microbial species and environmental conditions.",

Accelerated growth rate phase: Following acclimation, the microbes propagate at an increasing rate. There are two major processes that allow for the degradation of chemical compounds by microbes: a. The most effective is when the organisms use the contaminant as a food source for their growth, metabolism, and reproduction. This is accomplished by the microbe's ability to produce enzymes that catalyze the chemical contaminant as a carbon source (hence, that is why bioremediation is often a good choice for organic contaminants). In addition, the chemical contaminant is also a source of electrons that the microbe needs to extract for energy. That is, the chemical is the microbe's oxygen acceptor during respiration. The microbe produces enzymes that hasten the process of breaking chemical bonds and transferring electrons from the contaminant to an electron acceptor (oxygen for aerobic respiration, and metals [e.g., iron and manganese] and inorganic chemicals [e.g., nitrates and sulfates] for anaerobic respiration). b. A second, less effective process is known as \"secondary utilization.\" Microbes can transform chemical contaminants although the reaction provides no direct benefit to the microbial cell. Probably the most common, at least bestunderstood secondary utilization process is co-metabolism, wherein the microbes break down chemicals coincidentally with enzymes that they normally synthesize for metabolism or detoxification. A case is the methane-oxidizing bacteria that happen to degrade chlorinated hydrocarbons, benzene, phenol, and toluene by producing enzymes needed to transfer electrons to methane (i.e., the bacterium's normal electron acceptor). The normal methane oxidation enzymes auspiciously degrade the chemical contaminants, even though the chemicals cannot serve as the primary food source for the bacteria.",

Microbiologists and other biologists describe first-order processes using a half-life, whereas engineers commonly describe first-order processes using a first-order rate constant. This is because the rate of change relates directly to the constant. Also, in the presence of simultaneously operating first-order processes, such as biodegradation, the rate constant for the combined effect can be calculated as the sum of the individual rate constants. Transport and fate models can be evaluated using this property, because numerous processes can be combined into a single calibration parameter [15] .

Acidogenic microbes convert the feedstock sugars and amino acids into carbon dioxide, molecular hydrogen (H ), ammonia (NH 3 ), and organic compounds with the carboxyl functional group (ReCOOH), i.e., the organic acids. Next acetogenic microorganisms convert the organic acids into simpler acids, e.g., acetic acid, with the H 2 and NH 3 remaining in the mixture. The final step is methanogenesis, also known as biomethanation. This consists of methanogenic bacteria converting this mixture into methane (CH 4 ) and CO 2 . ",

Usually, heavy metal treatment involves changing oxidation states to alter toxicity and mobility. However, there is also growing use and potential for biosorbents to remove metallic wastes. Biosorption is bioenergetically neutral, because metabolism is not involved. Various biosorbents have been used, e.g., eggshells, bone, peat, and compost. The rate and amount of biosorption are limited by a chemicalesubstrate kinetic equilibrium and by the biosorbent's surface area and composition [74] . This also applies to bacterial biosorption, mainly at and across the bacterium's biofilm of living bacteria, but dead cells have also been shown to sorb metals. For example, living Bacillus sphaericus biosorbs arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr). Dead B. sphaericus also biosorbs Cr. In a laboratory study [74] , living cells of the two tolerant B. sphaericus strains sorbed 6 to 47% of Co, Hg, Fe, and As. Living and dead cells of B. sphaericus OT4b31 sorbed 25 and 44.5% of Cr, respectively, and B. sphaericus IV(4)10 biosorbed 32 and 45%, respectively. The differences are attributed to the absence of an active metabolism in dead cells, as well as to environmental factors (e.g., pH variation) and possibly to S-layer proteins' ability to entrap metallic ions. The S-layer is a monomolecular layer of identical proteins and glycoproteins of the bacterial cell envelope that can account for as much as 15% of the bacterium's protein content [65] . This attraction can occur in both living and dead cells.",

The movement and change of substances (e.g., nutrients and contaminants) across phase boundaries and compartmental interfaces can be envisioned as the separation and joining of films. The two-film model depicted in Figure 7 .18 demonstrates the relationship between the liquid 2. The environmental literature is not completely consistent in its use of the term \"phase.\" The term may be interpreted to mean exactly what physical chemists have defined, i.e., phase is the distinct state of matter in a physical system. Such matter is identical in chemical composition and physical state and separated from other material by the phase boundary as represented in Figure 7 .12. However, phase may be more akin in environmental contexts to \"fractional solubility,\" meaning that a substance can be found in varying amounts in different solvents. One of the most common examples of fractional solubility is demarcation between the concentration of a contaminant in the \"organic phase\" and \"aqueous phase\" as represented by the octanolewater partition coefficient (K ow ), discussed in this chapter. Another less commonly applied connotation of environmental phases is its synonymous usage with environmental \"media\" or \"compartments.\" for example, one may hear environmental engineers discussing the transport of a contaminant from the water phase to the air phase, or the soil phase to the water and air phases. Context, in fact, is important in many environmental discussions, and reading in context is often the only way to know what a publication means. Because environmental science, engineering, and technology draws from so many fields, numerous terms (e.g., particle) have various meanings which can only be understood within the context of the specific discussion. Furthermore, even within the environmental disciplines, uses of terms like phase will vary. For example, air experts may use the physical chemists' definition when discussing phase distributions within a stack gas, but may use the solubility fractionation definition when discussing the transformation and transport of a pollutant between a raindrop and the air (i.e., air-water partitioning). Likewise, soil and water scientists may apply the physicochemical definition of phases when in the laboratory (e.g., measuring the amount of a liquid or solid-phase analyte volatilizing to the gas phase from the gas chromatograph's column and carried as a gas to the detector). However, in the field they may refer to phase distribution as the movements among soil, water, and air compartments.",

Assuming complete mixing in the bulk phases and equilibrium between the substance's molecule and the molecules of the interface, for a substance to move from the gas phase to the liquid phase, it must first migrate from the bulk gas phase into the gas film, then diffuse through the gas film (a function of the gas' partial pressure), before crossing the interface. After it crosses the interface, the substances must diffuse through the liquid film and mix into the bulk liquid (a function of the substance's concentration in the liquid). This means that all resistance to movement occurs as the substance's molecules diffuse through the films to reach the interface region. That is why the two-film theory is also referred to as the double resistance theory. In liquid-to-gas transport, the concentration in the liquid changes as it moves from the bulk liquid phase through the liquid film. The rate of mass transfer from one phase to the other then equals the product of the amount of the substance being transferred times the resistance the substance receives when moving through the films. Thus, the difference in a contaminant's partial pressure in the bulk gas and at the interface is known as the gasside impedance, whereas the difference in a contaminant's concentration in the bulk liquid and at the interface is known as the liquid-side impedance [18] . Therefore, chemical reactions can occur in the bulk liquid, in the bulk solid, but also within the film.

Waste is applied in a circular rotating manner to prevent pooling or uneven deposits. The interstices and openings between the media allow for air penetration throughout the system. In addition, air can be supplied by blowers from the bottom of the reactor, migrating upward through the bed. This makes most of the trickling filter aerobic. The treated waste that moves downward through the bed subsequently enters a quiescent tank in which the microorganisms that are sloughed off of the rocks are settled, collected, and ultimately disposed of.

Loading requires a balance between sufficient food available for the microbial population that is returned from the settling basin to the aeration tank.

Wetlands naturally contain diverse and abundant microbial populations. They combine these with growth, nutrient extraction, photosynthesis, and ion exchange processes of plants (see Figure 7 .27 and the Phytoremediation section later in this chapter). For example, gasoline-contaminated groundwater has been bioremediated using a radial-flow constructed wetland system in Casper, Wyoming. In this system, subsurface beds of crushed concrete reclaimed from a closed refinery were insulated with 6-inch layers of mulch. Above these layers bulrushes, switchgrass, and cordgrass were planted in separate sections of the wetland system. About 700,000 gallons of water are passively treated each day, with large reductions in benzene and other hydrocarbons. The rock/mulch insulated layers allow biological activity to continue throughout the year, even in the cold Wyoming winters. The passive system is also cost-effective All three systems make use of microbes, nutrients, and oxygen, but the active system increases the contact between the microbes and organic matter by mechanically mixing the sludge layer (which contains the organic contaminants to be degraded) with the water in the lagoon. The engineered wetland also incorporates plant processes in the degradation process. Source: Refs [20, 21] . (estimated construction costs were about 20% of a pump and treat system that can meet similar criteria, e.g., air stripping and catalytic oxidation) [21] .

The biochemodynamics of the bioreactor affect anaerobic digestion rates, including temperature, pH, and concentration of toxic substances. The conventional anaerobic treatment process consists of a reactor containing waste and biosolids (sludge containing large microbial populations). As in the aerobic activated-sludge systems, these biosolids can be added continuously or in semi-batches, whereupon they are mixed in the bioreactor. In theory, the anaerobic digester is a once-through, completely mixed, reactor. If so, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) equals the solids retention time (SRT). This means that efficiency depends directly on the contact with the biosolids, i.e., the SRT. However, HRT and SRT can be decoupled for increased FIGURE 7.30 Anaerobic treatment system. Note in the photo the lighter substances that have migrated to the surface. These may be fats that have been separated physically during the treatment process, or bubbles from gases, such as methane, that are produced when the anaerobes degrade the wastes. Note that although this is an anoxic chamber, a thin film layer at the surface will be aerobic because it is in contact with the atmosphere. Photo courtesy of Vallero DJ. bioremediation efficiency. For example, an anaerobic upflow filter (AF) can substantially improve anaerobic degradation volumes and rates, because the filter can catch and sustain high concentrations of biosolids. By holding the solids, attenuated SRTs allow for much larger throughput, which is needed to degrade low-strength organic wastes under feasible environmental conditions (e.g., ambient temperatures and barometric pressures). A bed upflow reactor is another anaerobic system, but depends on the sorption of biomass on the surfaces of media. This is done by passing liquid solutions of the organic compounds to be treated upward through a bed of sand-sized particles at a velocity necessary to fluidize and partially expand the sand bed. More recently, the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket process (UASB) takes advantage of the inherent properties of flocculation and settling of anaerobic sludge, allowing for much higher HRT loadings and partitioning of gases (e.g., H 2 , CH 4 ) from the sludge solids. The UASB is based on two biochemodynamic processes (see Figure 7 .29): separation of solids and gases from the liquid and degradation of biodegradable organic matter. If heavy mechanical agitation is avoided, unlike the other aerobic digesters, a separate settler with a biosolids return pump is not needed, so reactor volume can flow consistently through the systems. Unlike the fluidized-bed reactor, high-rate effluent recirculation and pumping are also eliminated. The biogas production enhances continuous contact between substrate and anaerobes.

Various species of plants, depending on the contaminant, soil, climate, and local conditions are planted and grown. Some are harvested like crops (e.g., grasses) and others maintained for removal and sequestration of the contaminants for longer time periods. The harvested materials can be treated and recycled by various methods, including composting and other bioremediation approaches and thermal processes, depending on the sequestered pollutants (e.g., content and form of halogenated and metallic compounds). This procedure may be repeated as necessary to decrease soil contaminant levels down to target cleanup concentrations. If thermally treated, e.g., incinerated, emissions and ash residues must meet regulatory requirements, including disposal as a possible hazardous waste. Nickel, zinc, and copper are metals that have been particularly amenable to phytoextraction because hundreds of plant species have mechanisms for their uptake and absorption.

As evidence, biologists have observed the behavior of the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, leading them to some rather widely used approaches to seek biomimicry. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites. Part of their survival depends on their ability to insert genes into plant hosts, eliciting a crown gall, i.e., proliferation of cells near the soil surface. The genetic information for infecting the plant's neoplasmic growth is encoded within the plasmid. The Agrobacterium infection entails the transfer of DNA (T-DNA or Ti) to a random site in the plant genome. This natural capability to transfer genes has been put to use by bioengineers in biotechnologies. That is, agrobacteria are used to send foreign genes into plants by cutting out the bacterial T-DNA of the plasmid and replacing it with the desired foreign gene. This has been done on various species of dicotyledonous plants.",

In this sense they resemble the retroviruses, but differ in that the plasmids are actually \"naked\" forms of DNA. That is, plasmids do not encode genes necessary to encase the genetic material for transfer to a new host. The foreign DNA is introduced with this recombinant DNA technology and still must be transmitted through the germ line so that every cell has the same modified genetic material. Bioengineering's use of plasmid host-to-host for genetic modification relies on the transfer of genetic material directly by conjugation, i.e., modifying in-host gene expression so as to enhance the uptake of the genetic element by transformation [45] . Microbial transformation with plasmid DNA is not parasitic, nor is it symbiotic. It simply provides a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer within a population of microbes and typically provides a selective advantage under a given set of environmental conditions. Engineering plasmids also can instill an ability of microbes to change nutrient cycling, such as bacteria fixing elemental nitrogen or to degrade persistent organic compounds by advantageous microbial metabolism and growth in hostile, nutrient-deprived conditions [46] . Genetic modification, whether by transfection or from transposons' ability to carry genes to cells, may well end up giving the modified organisms competitive advantages over natural species within an environmental niche. From a systematic, environmental perspective, this certainly can be good for environmental cleanup, because the advantage can increase biodegradation. However, it can be bad if the competitive advantage changes microbial diversity in a negative way. Also, some of the proteins produced may be toxic and disrupt the life cycles of other organisms.",

Ex situ bioremediation allows for more variety in techniques, from entirely \"natural\" approaches of land application of sludges and wastewater, to land farming of contaminated materials, to bioreactors making use of genetically modified microbes, co-metabolism, and enzymatic processes. Up to a few decades ago, many of these processes were \"black boxes,\" in which the result was rather well understood, but the specific mechanisms were not. As these mechanisms became better understood, engineers were able to replicate and to enhance the use of microbes in engineered systems, i.e., bioreactors. This imparts greater control over the degradation processes and, as a result, can expedite the rate of the biotechnological processes (e.g., specifically enhanced microbes) and physicochemical processes (adding nutrients and dissolved oxygen, changing redox) taking place in the bioreactors.

This is difficult in natural microbial populations, but because genetically engineered bacteria rarely function in the wild, tools are needed to characterize their actual and expected behavior in the environment. To address these challenges, bioengineers can apply the so-called \"omics\" tools, beginning with genomics, i.e., characterizing the complete genetic information of these organisms. Some currently used tools include methods to monitor electron acceptance and electron donation, enzyme probes to measure microbial functional activity in the environment, functional genomic and phylogenetic microarrays, metabonomics, proteomics, and quantitative approaches for genetic testing (e.g., quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction [Q-PCR/qPCR] or kinetic polymerase chain reaction). Figure 7 .34 illustrates one conception of the use of omics tools to predict outcomes of environmental biotechnologies, especially in ecosystems. Genomics, including functional genomics, proteomic and systems modeling characterize community population ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, and ecosystem dynamics. Usually, DNA extracted from an environmental sample is cloned from a library or affixed to beads, and then directly sequenced. Following assemblage of the sequence, the computational identification of marker genes allows for the members of the community to be identified and phylogenetically classified. Thereupon, probes can be designed for later population-scale experiments (i.e., structure). Identification of the marker genes within fragments, along with other characterizations (e.g., GC content bias and codon usage preferences) allows for assigning sequence fragments into groups that correspond to one type of organism (i.e., \"binning\"). Functional capabilities of communities are described by computationally annotating genomes, i.e., predicting genes and assigning function using characterized homologs and genomic context. Information and knowledge pertaining to the presence of the genes also allows for the application of other \"omics\" approaches, including evaluation of the extracts of proteins and RNA transcripts from the environmental sample. Such investigations inform and enhance systems modeling efforts, which in turn can be applied to understanding and predicting ecosystem dynamics and lead the way to future investigations [32] .",

Thus, abstraction becomes even more necessary, but the concomitant uncertainties can be increased as organismal and environmental system uncertainties are propagated. This spectrum in Figure 7 .35 will be better characterized as better data are gathered. The advantage of computational approaches, however, is that they can be based on the first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology, whereas typical environmental models have often had to rely on probabilities and site-specific characteristics. That is to say, stochastic and deterministic models can benefit from the information that can be input from computational tools (e.g., metabonomics and proteomics). At present, however, the most commonly employed models rely on differential equations that characterize those biochemical and biophysical interactions among system components that are thought to represent a particular aspect of the system (e.g., dynamic properties of protein expression that would not be seen looking at individual proteins) [34] . Thus, appropriately scaled mathematical models that capture the underpinning principles at work in biochemical processes set the stage for computational models that continuously improve predictions of environmental consequences. This three-stage loop is shown in Figure 7 .36. For example, the effect on ecosystem function and structure (Figure 7 .34) from an introduced genetically modified microbe will be better characterized in the biochemical and mathematical models, but these systematic impacts ultimately depend on the computation approach. However, the improved systems biology and engineering better informs the biochemical model, which improves the mathematics and further enhances the computational model's predictive capacity.",

Both passive biotechnological systems, such as natural attenuation, and active remediation systems, such as pump and treat, including those using genetically modified microbes, require extensive and elaborate monitoring for regulatory compliance, process control, and performance measurement. This can be measured directly by analysis of soil and groundwater samples in an analytical laboratory. These monitoring activities often include quarterly groundwater or soil sampling required for periods up to and exceeding 30 years. Unfortunately, these direct measures of bioremediation are often expensive and sample collection and analysis is often time-consuming [42] . In fact, measurement data are almost always extended using models, such as simple and direct interpolation between sampling points. Indirect measures of bioremediation are not meant to replace analytical testing of samples, but can be useful as surrogate indicators of bioremediation success. In this case, measuring NO emissions and modeling attendant toluene remaining in a contaminated site can decrease the number of samples requiring expensive analysis, and can allow for a real-time, integrated, and system-wide measure of remediation.",

NO emitted from soils represents a significant source of atmospheric NO. However, it is difficult to study the influence of soil variables on NO flux under field conditions because the net flux of NO between soil and atmosphere results from myriad processes that operate simultaneously and are regulated independently from each other, as well as other processes that are interdependent and affect one another (e.g., nutrient cycling, which affects the soil's ionic strength, which in turn affects pH and nitrogen speciation).

This is an instance of how certain genetically modified strains can help in bioremediation. For example, if the bacteria can gain resistance to toluene toxicity, the initial shock when the microbes come into contact with the wastes would be reduced. Despite its toxicity, however, toluene has been demonstrated to be readily bioremediated in a manner similar to other substituted benzenes, which account for a large share of contaminants found in the environment [45] . This suggests that the structural activity relationships of toluene are indicative of those of other aromatic contaminants.

However, in reality, when monitoring wells are analyzed near plumes undergoing active biodegradation, the samples are seldom entirely depleted of one or more of these electron acceptors. There are seldom such \"bright lines\" in the field. For example, facultative aerobes, those that can shift from oxygen to anaerobic electron acceptors (especially nitrate), can change electron acceptors even when molecular oxygen is not completely depleted. This can be attributed to the fact that redox potentials for oxygen and nitrate are not substantially different (at pH 7, O 2 \u00bc \u00fe820 V and NO \u00bc \u00fe740 V, compared to CO 2 \u00bc \u00c0240 V). Also, the apparent divergence from pure thermodynamics in the field may simply be a sampling artifact, which can be attributed to the way monitoring is conducted. For example, monitoring wells do not collect water from a \"point.\" Rather, the screens (the perforated regions of underground piping through which water enters) are set at 1.5 to 3 m intervals, so waters will mix from different vertical horizons.

However, each compound has specific physicochemical properties that will affect its reactivity and movement in the environment. As evidence, the BTEX compounds of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes usually compose only a small amount (ranging from about 15 to 26%) of the mole fraction of gasoline or jet fuel [47] . However, largely because the BTEX compounds have high aqueous solubilities (152e1780 mg L \u00c01 ) compared to the other organic constituents (0.004 e1230 mg L \u00c01 ) in these fuels, they often account for more than two-thirds of the amount of the contaminants that migrate away from the LUST. Also, soils are seldom homogeneous, so even if the contaminant is well characterized, how it will react and move is largely affected by the media's characteristics, such as their potential to sorb pollutants. Ease of implementation and sensitivity are both important considerations when deciding how to address environmental problems.

In turn, this information provided the toluene degradation parameter from which soil microbial activity could be matched with NO emissions from soil. Thus, the predictive model was developed by comparing the laboratory studies to the model output using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for linear regressions. The laboratory results indicated that microbial populations grew with respect to toluene concentration significantly (P 5% and most P values 1%), so this allowed for a mathematical relationship between microbial population size and toluene degradation [58] . Also, the mass of NO released from soil in chambers had a direct relationship to microbial population size. Thus, a numerical model could be developed to link toluene concentrations in soil with NO flux measurement. This led to the development of a numerical model using ordinary differential equations, which could be evaluated from actual, direct measurements of the chemical undergoing degradation (toluene) and of the chemical being released by the microbes (NO).",

Specific identification of the actual microbial species producing the NO, however, is not necessary to link the rates of decomposition of organic contaminants to NO production. Although there were good correlations between the NO production rate and toluene degradation, long-term NO production that accompanies toluene degradation should be measured in future research, because this may offer insights as to how nitrifying bacteria growth and metabolism can be associated with biodegradation.

The model used an indirect, noninvasive metric (NO) to estimate rates of microbial population growth and the concomitant breakdown of toluene. The ratio of NO emission to toluene degradation was positively correlated across all levels of toluene concentrations and incubation times, meaning that NO emissions can be a good surrogate measure of toluene contamination in soil, if the duration of toluene incubation or initial soil toluene concentration is known. Therefore, NO flux from soil measured in the field may help to estimate the rate of toluene degradation in the soil and thus provide an ongoing metric of remediation success, an indication when soil remediation has met target concentrations, and a simple and integrated complement to postclosure monitoring (e.g., a spike in NO production and application of this model may indicate the presence of a new carbon source, which should be investigated). The simulated toluene concentration, number of soil microorganisms, and NO flux as a function of time showed statistical significance (P < 0.01) for all levels of toluene concentration with the experimental data. This finding supports the adequacy of the model for supporting the NOetolueneesoil microbial relationship. The mathematical model derived in this study suggests a novel approach for characterizing and predicting the fate of other toxic aromatic compounds in soil. Because the results of the investigation were based on experimental data and the analysis was conducted under specific environmental conditions, the emphasis throughout the research focused on specific rather than general features of the dynamics. However, the results can presumably be extended to other bioremediation systems with different environmental conditions, so long as these systems are evaluated using the protocol described here.",

Nitric oxide may prove a valuable indicator of bioremediation of air toxic (i.e., toluene) concentrations. The model found that chemical concentration, soil microbial abundance, and NO production can be directly related to experimental results (significant at P < 0.01) for all toluene concentrations tested. This indicates that the model may prove useful in monitoring and predicting the fate of toxic aromatic contaminants in a complex soil system. This can be valuable in predicting the duration of such contaminants in soil sinks, but may also prove useful to environmental decision making. The model developed from this research may prove useful in predicting emissions of oxides of nitrogen from soils contaminated with organic compounds. Therefore, the model may help in predicting the interrelations of ozone precursors, such as changes in reservoirs of hydrocarbons and releases of various oxides of nitrogen. As such, the model may be a tool for decision makers in ozone nonattainment areas. For example, an ozone nonattainment area that is hydrocarbon limited may benefit from the breakdown of organic compounds via nitrification or denitrification (i.e., lessening the sources of hydrocarbons stored and potentially available to be released to the atmosphere). Conversely, in an ozone nonattainment area that is NO x limited, the emissions of NO may need to be limited to reduce ambient concentrations of ozone (i.e., perhaps increasing bioremediation efforts during winter months and decreasing them in summer, thereby lowering NO x emissions when photochemical reaction rates are slower, thus limiting the production of ozone).",

The thickness of the biofilm in the MBBR carriers also has been shown to increase with decreasing temperatures [62] .",

These targets may be reactive substances (e.g., alkanes), recalcitrant substances (e.g., PCBs), or nutrients (e.g., nitrogen). Unfortunately, waste streams often consist of mixtures of all of these substances, so the reactor may have to be optimized based on the most likely and most troublesome substances and/or discrete systems may be needed. These discrete systems may be installed in sequence. For example, a substance may be toxic to beneficial microbes that are expected to degrade one type of waste. If so, this toxic substance would first have to be removed before the waste reaches that bioreactor. Indeed, physical separation (primary treatment) is often the initial step.

An efficient system is one that keeps pollutants from reaching drinking water supplies, e.g., aquifers and surface waters. For example, a system may be less efficient if beneficial bacteria do not have sufficient time of contact with the wastewater because the soil is too permeable, i.e., biosorption is not taking place at the optimal rate. The operation of a successful onsite system depends on the application of knowledge about the processes described in this chapter. Indeed, it is likely that genetically modified microbes will be used in onsite systems to a greater extent in a desire for greater efficiencies, especially if the density of housing units is high.

For example, the corals off the coast of Florida, the world's third largest barrier reef, have been highly stressed, with half of the live coral off the Florida coast lost in the past few years.

Disease outbreaks that are increasing in frequency and geographic range are affecting a greater diversity of coral reef species. Global climate change and associated impacts including reduced rates of coral calcification, increased coral bleaching and mortality (associated with variety of stresses including increased sea surface temperatures), increased storm frequency, and sea level rise. Although all seven threats relate to biotechnologies, the sixth in the list appears to be an implication of microbial infestation and infection. These microbes appear to be transported long distances in winds aloft. For example, some of the invasive bacteria that threaten coral reef habitats may be coming from Africa in the form of Saharan dust. Deserts commonly contain gravel and bedrock, along with some sand. The Sahara is the exception, with sand covering 20% of the spatial extent of the desert. This means that the Sahara often loses large amounts of dust by winds that advectively transport particles in plumes thatcan travel across the Atlantic Ocean, depositing dust along the way (see Figure 7 .44). Saharan dust carries disease-causing bacteria and fungi that have been associated with the destruction of coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea.",

The scientific goals associated with these threats, along with their respective ordinal (high, medium, and low) priorities for scientific research are shown in Figure 7 .45. Note that invasive species can include numerous organisms, but recently algae and bacteria have been highlighted as a much larger concern than had previously been thought. The bacteria are likely arriving in the coral reef ecosystems by long-range atmospheric transport. Note in Figure 7 .46 that the actions recommended by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to address these threats vary by region. Figures 7.45 and 7 .46 indicate that coral reefs are threatened by an array of physical, chemical, and biological stressors. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is an example of a physical stressor. UV radiation is a ubiquitous stressor that is very likely impacting human and ecological systems on a global scale. It has been implicated in observed shifts in polar plankton community composition, local and global declines in amphibian population abundance and diversity, coral bleaching syndrome, not to mention an increasing incidence of human skin cancer and other diseases. Disruption and loss of coral reef ecosystem communities due to coral bleaching/disease leads to coral mortality, changes in reef persistence and formation dynamics, as well as cascading reef community interactions [84] .

In other words, the tin compounds were added to paint for the stated purpose of preventing the growth of marine organisms. So, when the compounds leach into water, they continue this mode of action, including in coral reef habitats, decreasing the reproduction mechanisms in aquatic organisms. This was a major reason for the 2003 ban on this use of tributyl tin in the United States. This is also an example of an indirect biological threat, because tributyl tin first affects hormonal response at the cellular level, which in turn affects the overall structure and function of the coral community.Biological agents can present an even greater and more ominous threat to coral reefs. The microbial ecology within a coral reef is complex. For example, some algae are symbiotic and others are parasitic to corals.

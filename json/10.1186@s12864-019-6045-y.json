Results: The electrolyte leakage, POD activity, soluble protein, and MDA content showed a linear sustained increase under cold stress. The critical period of cold damage in T. hemsleyanum was from 12 h to 48 h. Expression profiles revealed 18,104 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among these critical time points.

Genes encoding PAL, 4CL, CHS, ANR, FLS, and LAR were significantly up-regulated by cold stress, which could result in a significant increase in crucial flavonols (catechin, epicatechin, rutin, and quercetin) in T. hemsleyanum. Conclusions: Overall, our results show that the expression of genes related to flavonol biosynthesis as well as flavonol content increased in T. hemsleyanum under cold stress. These findings provide valuable information regarding the transcriptome changes in response to cold stress and give a clue for identifying candidate genes as promising targets that could be used for improving cold tolerance via molecular breeding.

Extracts of total flavonoids from T. hemsleyanum have obvious antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, and antipyretic actions [1] . Due to over exploitation, wild resources are on the verge of extinction in recent years. T. hemsleyanum is a cold-sensitive species, and chilling sensitivity is the major environmental factor limiting growth, development and geographical distribution of the plant. The artificial domestication of T. hemsleyanum suffers from the low winter survival rate.",

Recent developments in deep-sequencing technologies and relevant analytical approaches can provide the large-scale transcriptome information in the absence of a reference genome, and thus it is especially useful in non-model species, whose genomic sequences are often unavailable [3] . Over the last few years, RNA-Seq has been increasingly applied to rapidly analyze mRNA profiles in a range of plant species under exposure to diverse and adverse environmental conditions, including drought [4] , high salinity [5] , heavy metal stress [6] ,pathogen attack, and cold stress [7] . It allows us to use a \"reverse genetics\" strategy to identify candidate genes, to provide available gene resources for developing transgenic plants. Early plant responses to chilling stress involve numerous genes encoding transcription factors and proteins involved in phytohormone signal transduction, ROS metabolism, secondary metabolism, etc. [8] .",

Our previous studies indicated that the main flavonols in T. hemsleyanum were quercetin, procyanidine B1, procyanidine B2, catechin, epicatechin, rutin, kaempferol etc. However, gene regulation and signaling pathways related to cold response in T. hemsleyanum remain unknown.

Among the mapped enzymes, we identified two PAL homologs in annotated transcriptome unigene dataset, and both of them were highly expressed with RPKM values> 100 and were significantly up-regulated by 3-4 fold under cold stress. One highly expressed C4H gene was predicted in our dataset, which was significantly up-regulated by 2.5 folds under cold stress. These genes encode the enzyme that catalyzes the second step of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Thirty-seven CHS unigenes were identified in the T. hemsleyanum transcriptome. CHS is also the key enzyme in the flavonoids synthesis pathway, catalyzing the process from malonyl-CoA to naringenin chalcone. The expression of the 22 CHS genes was almost undetectable in the four analyzed libraries. The remaining 15 CHS unigenes were highly expressed, among which c101781_g1 was the most highly expressed CHS gene, with an increased RPKM value from 923 to 7889 under cold stress. Five CHI genes were identified in our dataset, and the fact of c82212_g1 was the most highly expressed suggested it may be crucial for naringenin biosynthesis, with an increased RPKM value from 128 to 988 under cold stress. In contrast, only three F3\u2032H, one F3\u20325'H, three FNS, and three F3H genes were predicted in our dataset. ANR and LAR catalyze the transfer of leucoanthocyanidin to the flavonols group, such as epicatechin, epigallocatechin, catechin C, gallocatechin, etc. C78251_g1 was the most highly expressed LAR gene, with a 39 fold significant upregulation under cold stress. Eight ANR genes were identified, with c84306_g1 and c78251_g1 being the most abundantly and the most remarkably differentially expressed. Most of these genes were highly expressed at Z12h and Z24h, but exhibited down-regulated expression at Z48h. These results imply the early and late stages of cold stress might be important for flavonoid biosynthesis. A color bar is presented at the bottom.

The correlation between qRT-PCR and RNA-seq was measured by scatter plotting log2-fold changes, which showed a positive correlation coefficient in both techniques (Pearson coefficient R 2 = 0.88) ( Fig. 8 ). This independent evaluation revealed the reliability of the RNA-seq data.

Under cold stress conditions, various osmotic substances such as proline and soluble proteins that play important roles in osmotic adjustment are quickly accumulated [10] . Besides, Malandialdehyde (MDA) is the final product of lipid peroxidation, its content can reflect the severity of membrane lipid peroxidation and the stress tolerance of plants. Antioxidative enzymes such as peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) are induced quickly and required to deal with oxidative damage under cold stress [11] .

In this study, four traits including electrolyte leakage, POD activity, the content of MDA and soluble protein were investigated in T. hemsleyanum leaves at seven time points under four low-temperature treatments. Similar to previous studies in other species, these investigated traits revealed a dramatic induction in response to cold treatment, and the effect was aggravated along with the prolonging of stress time. The electrolyte leakage, POD activity, and MDA content showed a linear sustained increase as treatment time went up from 0 h to 72 h, by 321.4 \u00b1 15.3%, 173.8 \u00b1 10.2%, and 163.3 \u00b1 12.1%, respectively. During this period, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h were critical time points of the dramatic change. The three traits exhibited a consistent response, indicating they played highly coordinate functions in T. hemsleyanum. However, it is worth noting that the tendency of soluble protein content was slightly different from the above three traits. The soluble protein content increased by 171.0 \u00b1 9.2% from 0 h to 24 h, then there was a significant decline after that time point. Similarly, the content of Fig. 9 The HPLC chromatograms of reference standards and T. hemsleyanum sample. 1 procyanidins B 1 ; 2. catechin; 3. procyanidinsB 2 ; 4. epicatechin; 5. rutin; 6. quercetin; 7. kaempferol soluble protein and soluble sugar of L. lancifolium leaves increased between 0 h to 24 h, then rapidly fell during subsequent cold stress [12] . It might be because that some stress proteins in plant signal transduction were induced in the early stress stage in responses to environmental stresses. Along with the prolonging of stress time, the cellular damage and apoptosis might accelerate protein degradation after 24 h. So 12 h and 24 h were critical time points of the dramatic change of soluble protein content. To obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms of the cold stress, a whole-transcriptome analysis induced by cold stress at these critical time points in T. hemsleyanum was then performed.",

Investigation on the influence mechanism of cold stress on flavonoid metabolism pathways is particularly important. In the present study, we identified the major genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis and accumulation in T. hemsleyanum. A total of 114 unigenes in our transcriptome dataset were assigned to the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. With the exception of F3\u20325\u2032H and UFGT, most of these enzymes were encoded by more than one annotated gene. Such sequences may represent different fragments of a single transcript, different members of a gene family, or both. Similarly, in the transcriptome data of NaCl-treated Reaumuria trigyna, 118 unigenes were identified to be flavone synthetase genes. Among these 118 unigenes, the expression levels of genes related to the flavonol biosynthesis pathway (C4H, CHS, and FLS) were higher than other flavone synthetase genes [9] . However, in the previously annotated C. chekiangoleosa transcriptome dataset [19] , Forty-three unigenes were annotated as flavone synthetase genes, among which, F3H, DFR, and UFGT were much more actively involved in flavonoid biosynthesis than these genes in our study. The reason for the difference may be because anthocyanin and flavonol are two different subclasses of flavonoids, and they are generated in different branches of flavonoid synthesis pathway. The major component of cold-treated T. hemsleyanum and NaCl-treated Reaumuria trigyna were both flavonol, while the major component of Camellia chekiangoleosa was anthocyanin. Thus, this pathway appears to be conserved among different species, but there is still some diversity.",

In our study, flavonols content was positively correlated with the transcripts of downstream genes (LAR, ANR, and LDOX) as well as initiative upstream genes (PAL and C4H) in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway responding to cold stress and coincided with flavonols biosynthesis. The content of five flavonols in T. hemsleyanum including procyanidins B1, catechin,epicatechin, rutin, and quercetin remarkably increased in response to cold stress. Similar studies involving Reaumuria trigyna have also shown that flavonol biosynthesis was induced by ultraviolet-B and salt stresses. Of 118 annotated flavone synthetase unigenes, 47 were annotated as members of families related to the flavonol biosynthetic pathway. The expressions of genes related to the flavonol biosynthesis pathway (C4H, CHS, F3H3, FLS, F3'5'H, F3'H, and OMT) increased under NaCl and UV-B treatments. The content of several flavonols including rutin, hyperoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-neohespeidoside, and myricetin increased in response to NaCl and UV-B stresses [9] . In grape berries, UV-B increased the expression of the key flavonol biosynthesis gene FLS, F3\u2032H, F3\u20325\u2032H, and OMT, resulting in increased flavonol and anthocyanin content in the skin [21] . The higher transcript levels of FLS and a higher amount of 3 main flavonols (kaempferol, myricetin and quercetin) were observed in tartary buckwheat under different environmental stress [22] . FLS, an important enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, catalyzes the oxidizing reaction of dihydroflavonol to form flavonols (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol, and Myricetin). Quercetin and kaempferol can be used further to generate rutin by glycosylation. Both catechin and epicatechin were the monomers of proanthocyanidin, which were synthesized by the catalyst of LAR and ANR, respectively. Low expression abundance genes are generally considered to be the limited step of a synthesis processes. This viewpoint is in accordance with our study. In the present study, most of annotated LAR, ANR and FLS unigenes were normally low or moderateabundance, but their expressions were observed to be significantly up-regulated under cold stress. As evidence of the activity improvement of LAR, ANR and FLS, the contents of catechin, epicatechin and quercetin were remarkably increased to 5.02, 5.26, and 4.95 times, respectively.",

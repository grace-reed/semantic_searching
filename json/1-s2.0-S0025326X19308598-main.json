However, the influence of these changes on larval survival and settlement is not well understood. We examined the effect of salinity (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 ppt) and temperature (27\u00b0C, 30\u00b0C, and 33\u00b0C) on settlement and survival of larvae of the octocoral, Heliopora coerulea. Larvae settled successfully at salinities from 25 to 30 ppt. On the other hand, larval survival and settlement decreased with increasing temperature. A combination of 25-35 ppt and 27-30\u00b0C resulted in highest survival and settlement. These results indicate that early life stages of H. coerulea are negatively impacted by thermal stress but may be able to survive at reduced salinity. The wider tolerance range of H. coerulea larvae compared to most scleractinian larvae may thus contribute to the success of this coral on disturbed reef ecosystems.",

As such, the dynamics and persistence of coral populations are dependent on the success of corals during their early life history, particularly during fertilization, settlement, and metamorphosis (Richmond et al., 2018) . During these early life stages, corals experience high mortality because of predation, competition, and environmental perturbations (Ritson-Williams et al., 2009; Vermeij and Sandin, 2008 ). Yet, how much environmental variability can be tolerated by corals during the pelagobenthic transition is not well understood, especially for less-studied groups like the octocorals.",

Resilience to environmental perturbations is influenced by a multitude of factors, including morphology, associated symbionts, gene expression, hydrographics, and history of exposure (McClanahan et al., 2012) . However, anthropogenic activities, such as mariculture and coastal development, along with climate change-associated disturbances, such as intensified precipitation and thermal stress, can alter marine environmental conditions to levels detrimental to coral reproduction and survival. In adult corals, reduced salinity has been shown to cause osmotic stress while elevated temperature impacts coral symbiosis (Chavanich et al., 2012; Kuanui et al., 2015) . Thus, the influence of these stressors on coral larvae, individually or in combination, needs to be examined further, especially for octocorals.",

H. coerulea is a gonochoric brooding coral (Babcock, 1990) . The coral releases azooxanthellate planula larvae that tend to settle a few hours after hatching (Babcock, 1990; Harii and Kayanne, 2003) . This behavior contributes to a narrow dispersal range (< 5 km), dominance in specific reef sites, and low genotypic diversity within some populations (Yasuda N et al., 2014) . This may be compounded by the ability of the coral to inhibit the settlement of heterospecific larvae in its vicinity (Atrigenio et al., 2017) . Furthermore, H. coerulea is believed to have a higher thermal optimum and a lower bleaching susceptibility compared to scleractinian corals (Hajime et al., 2002; Zann and Bolton, 1985) .",

Based on regular monitoring by the Bolinao Marine Laboratory, the average annual temperature at the site from 2016 to 2018 was 29.31 \u00b1 1.75\u00b0C. During the coldest months of the year (December to February), average temperature ranged from 26 to 27\u00b0C with minima of 23-24\u00b0C. During the warmest months (May to July), average temperature ranged from 30 to 31\u00b0C with maxima of 33-34\u00b0C. Average salinity in the area ranged from 31 to 34 ppt. However, during the monsoon season or after intense precipitation events, seawater salinities as low as 26-30 ppt have been recorded (Sayco et al., 2019) . Coral colonies (approximately 35 cm in diameter) were brought to the outdoor hatchery of the Bolinao Marine Laboratory (BML) of the Marine Science Institute, University of the Philippines. Colonies were placed in buckets with flowing seawater and aeration. Seawater flow was turned off before sunset. The following morning released larvae were collected by filtration through a 120 \u03bcm nylon mesh (Villanueva et al., 2008) . Larvae released on the same day by different colonies were pooled and placed in a container at a stocking density of around 1 individual per 2 ml. Larvae were randomly collected from this pool for the different experiments.",

Yet, studies on the influence of reduced salinity on the larvae of brooding octocorals are limited. While corals are thought to be stenohaline osmoconformers with a limited tolerance for salinity fluctuations (Ferrier-Pages et al., 1999; Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989; True, 2012) , susceptibility to salinity stress can vary across genera and is linked to the adaptation of corals to conditions typically encountered in their environment (Berkelmans et al., 2012; Hedouin et al., 2015) . However, species-specific differences in salinity tolerance have also been observed even for corals that experience similar environmental fluctuations. For example, Acropora hyacinthus, Favites abdita, Platygyra daedalea, and P. sinensis from Thailand exhibit reduced settlement at 28-32 ppt (True, 2012) whereas a salinity of 28-36 ppt had no effect on Orbicella faceolata from the Florida Keys (Vermeij et al., 2006) . Larvae of Acropora cytherea and A. pulchra from French Polynesia also exhibited significant reduction in survival at 26 ppt (Hedouin et al., 2015) . Fertilization and survival of P. daedalea and A. millepora from the Great Barrier Reef were similarly reduced at salinities of 25.8 and 33.1 ppt, with even greater reduction in survival at 18.4 ppt (Scott et al., 2013) . These studies demonstrate that lowered salinity during spawning may be detrimental to the reproductive success and recruitment of these corals.",

Marine invertebrates synthesize and degrade compatible organic osmolytes such as glycerol, a polyol, and free amino acids (FAAs) to alter intracellular osmolarity and maintain homeostasis (Mayfield and Gates, 2007) . It is possible that H. coerulea larvae produce similar osmolytes to maintain normal cellular functions under salinity stress. However, it is important to note that, since the settlement substrates used in the experiment were conditioned at a salinity range of 31-33 ppt, they may be covered in microbial biofilm that is adapted to reduced salinity conditions. As the biofilm community plays a key role in the induction of coral larval metamorphosis (Webster et al., 2004) , future studies are needed to examine how biofilm formation is affected by variations in seawater salinity and whether this would have a subsequent influence on the settlement of coral larvae.",

The larger larvae of Fungia fungites have been found to tolerate temperatures of up to 34\u00b0C, whereas the smaller larvae of Lithophyllon repanda do not survive above 31\u00b0C (Baria et al., 2015) . Differences in thermal sensitivity may also be attributed to differences in life history, with larvae of brooders, such as F. fungites and P. damicornis, exhibiting higher temperature tolerance than larvae of broadcast spawning corals (Cumbo et al., 2013; Haryanti et al., 2015; Randall and Szmant, 2009) . Moreover, latitudinal differences in thermal tolerance among corals may be related to the history of exposure of the parental colonies to thermal stress regimes (Hoeksema and Matthews, 2011; Loya et al., 2001; Thompson and Woesik, 2009) . For instance, settlement and post-settlement survival of P. acuta from Hong Kong were not affected by elevated temperature, likely because of the large annual range of temperature experienced in this locality (Chui and Ang, 2017) . Studies have also shown that elevated temperature of 29\u00b0C reduced larval swimming and facilitated settlement of Stylophora pistillata from southern Taiwan (Putnam et al., 2008) .",

In the current study, we observed that, while increasing temperature by~3\u00b0C above the yearly average reduced the survival of coral larvae to 25%, this effect was not intensified when coupled with exposure to reduced salinity. Thus, elevated temperature had a greater impact on larval survival and settlement than reduced salinity. Simultaneous exposure to the two stressors had no detectable additive effect on H. coerulea larvae. Similar observations have been reported in other species of adult corals exposed to both stressors (Buddemeier and Fautin, 1993; Chavanich et al., 2012; Reynaud et al., 2004) . These contrast with observations in P. acuta from Hong Kong, which exhibited enhanced settlement under a combination of elevated temperature and reduced salinity of 22 and 26 ppt (Chui and Ang, 2017) . The variability in response among corals may be attributed to historical exposure to different stressors that have allowed the corals to acclimatize and adapt to local conditions (Berkelmans et al., 2012; Hedouin et al., 2015) .",

In the octocoral, Corallium rubrum, genetic markers that point to potential adaptations for survival in highly variable environments were observed by comparing individuals living in shallow depths and those from deeper and more stable environments (Pratlong et al., 2015) . Moreover, sequencing of the adult H. coerulea transcriptome revealed enrichment of transcripts encoding heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes that may be important for maintenance of cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (Guzman et al., 2018) . This suggests that octocorals possess genetic adaptations that contribute to their ability to tolerate warmer seawater temperatures.

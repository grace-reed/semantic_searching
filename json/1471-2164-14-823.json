    "abstract": "Background: Pear (Pyrus spp) is an important fruit species worldwide; however, its genetics and genomic information is limited. Combining the Solexa/Illumina RNA-seq high-throughput sequencing approach (RNA-seq) with Digital Gene Expression (DGE) analysis would be a powerful tool for transcriptomic study. This paper reports the transcriptome profiling analysis of Chinese white pear (P. bretschneideri) using RNA-seq and DGE to better understand the molecular mechanisms in fruit development and maturation of Chinese white pear. Results: De novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis of Chinese white pear were performed in an unprecedented depth (5.47 gigabase pairs) using high-throughput Illumina RNA-seq combined with a tag-based Digital Gene Expression (DGE) system. Approximately, 60.77 million reads were sequenced, trimmed, and assembled into 90,227 unigenes. These unigenes comprised 17,619 contigs and 72,608 singletons with an average length of 508 bp and had an N of bp. Sequence similarity analyses against six public databases (Uniprot, NR, and COGs at NCBI, Pfam, InterPro, and KEGG) found that 61,636 unigenes can be annotated with gene descriptions, conserved protein domains, or gene ontology terms. By BLASTing all 61,636 unigenes in KEGG, a total of 31,215 unigenes were annotated into 121 known metabolic or signaling pathways in which a few primary, intermediate, and secondary metabolic pathways are directly related to pear fruit quality. DGE libraries were constructed for each of the five fruit developmental stages. Variations in gene expression among all developmental stages of pear fruit were significantly different in a large amount of unigenes. Conclusion: Extensive transcriptome and DGE profiling data at five fruit developmental stages of Chinese white pear have been obtained from a deep sequencing, which provides comprehensive gene expression information at the transcriptional level. This could facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanisms in fruit development and maturation. Such a database can also be used as a public information platform for research on molecular biology and functional genomics in pear and other related species.",

Pyrus species are widely used for commercial fruit production in 76 countries or regions around the world (http://faostat.fao.org) and their economic importance has been well recognized [1] . There are four major edible species in Pyrus: P. communis L. is mainly cultivated in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Australia. The other three species, P. bretschneideri Rehd., P. ussuriensis Maxim., and P. pyrifolia (Burm.) Nakai., are grown in East Asian [1, 2] . The world production of pear has doubled in the past 16 years. China is the largest pear producer. In 2010, China produced 15.23 million tons (Mt) of pear fruits that accounted of 67.26% of world pear production (22.64 Mt) (FAOSTAT, 2012) .",

Illumina sequencing of transcriptomes for yeast [13, 14] , Arabidopsis [15] , mouse [16, 17] , and human cells [18, 19] has confirmed that next generation sequencing is well-suited for surveying transcriptome profiles in eukaryotes. Recently Illumina RNA-seq system has been used to identify genes related to bud dormancy in pear (P. pyrifolia) [20] . RNA-seq is not limited to detecting transcripts for organisms with existing genomic sequences; it also can be used to sequence nonmodel organisms that lack of genomic information [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . DGE is a tag-based transcriptome sequencing approach in which the expression level of all genes in a sample is measured by counting the number of individual mRNA molecules produced from each gene, which enables the DGE protocol more suitable and affordable for comparative gene expression studies [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .

Before assembly, adaptor sequences, empty reads, low quality sequences with N percentage (i.e., the percentage of nucleotides in read which could not be sequenced) over 5%, and those containing more than 20% bases with Q-value \u2264 10 were removed. De novo assembly of the cleaned reads was performed using SOAPdenovo software (version 1.03, http://soap.genomics.org.cn). The de Bruijn graph was firstly used to generate contigs [34] . The reads were then mapped back to the contigs, and the paired-end reads and contigs from the same transcript were further joined into scaffolds. The complete scaffolds were subsequently obtained after the pairedend reads were again used for gap fillings [34] . To reduce any sequence redundancy, the scaffolds were further assembled into unigenes using TGICL (copyright (c), http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi) [35] . Among them, the scaffolds with more than 70% similarity after multiple alignments were grouped into clusters, and others that cannot reach the threshold set and fall into any assembly should remain as a list of singletons.

A total of 60.8 millions of 90 bp raw reads were obtained from the Illumina paired-end sequencing with 5.47 gigabase pairs (Gbp) of raw data. After a stringent quality filtering process, 4.95 Gbp of clean data (90.5% of raw data) was remained. The Q20 percentage (an error probability lower than 1%) of the final sequence generated in this study (97.5%) was greater than those of tea (88%) [39] , mouse (95%) [40] , and Chinese bayberry (93%) [41] , indicating that sequencing throughput and quality was acceptable for further analysis. De novo assembly of all clean reads by SOAPdenovo program produced 132,987 contigs ( Table 1 ). The mean contig size was 338 bp and the N 50 was 474 bp (i.e. 50% of the assembled bases were incorporated into contigs 474 bp or longer). Of all 132,987 contigs, 25,936 (19.5% of total) were larger than 500 bp (Figure 2A ). After paired-end joining and gap-filling, the contigs were subsequently assembled into scaffolds. To reduce sequence redundancy, the assembled scaffolds were further clustered into 90,227 unigenes (larger than 150 bp) using TGICL software [35] , including 17,619 clusters (mean size: 732 bp, N 50 : 902 bp) and 72,608 singletons (mean size: 452 bp, N 50 : 550 bp), as shown in Table 1 . This unigene set had an average length of 508 bp and an N of 635 bp (Table 1) . Of all 90,227 unigenes, 25,415 (28.2%) were \u2265500 bp and 8,452 (9.4%) were \u22651,000 bp. The size distribution of these unigenes is shown in Figure 2B . To evaluate the quality of the dataset, the sequencing bias was analyzed by detecting random distribution of reads in assembled unigenes (Additional file 6). The 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of all assembled unigenes contained relatively fewer reads and other positions showed a greater distribution, indicating that the assembled 90,227 unigenes show a great reliability and likely cover most of the transcriptome sequences.",

A total of 33,205 annotated sequences were clustered into 25 COG categories ( Figure 5 ) in which the cluster of \"General function prediction\" represented the largest group (5,021, 15.1%) followed by \"Transcription\" (3,230, 9.7%), \"Replication, recombination and repair\" (2,660, 8.0%), and \"Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones\" (2,539, 7.7%).",

                "text": "The overall quality of pear fruits is closely related to flavor, grit (stone cell) content, flesh texture, skin russet, and appearance [1, 46] . During fruit development and maturation, pear fruits undergo a series of physiological and biochemical changes including expansion of size, accumulation of soluble solids, change of pigments, and formation of aromatic volatiles [1, 2] . Most of these traits are inherited in a complex polygenic manner and controlled by multiple QTLs, which poses a significant challenge to traditional breeding [2, 47] . In order to better understand the genetic and molecular basis of these changes related to quality formation, a few pathways including several primary, intermediate, and secondary metabolic pathways that are related to pear quality development were analyzed. A total of 61,636 annotated unigenes were used to analyze metabolic pathway genes with simple keyword searches. Each search result was confirmed with a BLAST search. Fruit development is involved in accumulation of starch and soluble sugar in fruits. Investigation of gene expression patterns in carbohydrate metabolisms will facilitate understanding of the fruit quality formation during the course of fruit development. According to KEGG, 2,417 unigenes were identified to be associated with carbohydrate metabolisms. These genes were classified into several metabolic pathways ( Figure 6A ). In this study, multiple unigenes involved in the main flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were annotated according to KEGG ( Figure 6B ). Flavonoids including phenylpropanoids, flavones, flavonols, and anthocyanins are important secondary metabolites that are directly involved in pear fruit quality development, such as grit (stone cell) content, skin russet, and appearance [1, 46] . Starch and sucrose metabolic pathways accounted for 29.2% of all 2,417 unigenes are another important group of carbohydrate metabolic pathways ( Figure 6A ). BLAST analysis showed that 18 key enzymes (outlined in Additional file 10) that are defined by 220 unigenes are involved in starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. Invertase (25) , sucrose synthase (SS) (24), ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (24) , sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) (23), and starch synthase (23) were ranked top five greatest numbers of singletons matching the gene description. Other primary metabolic pathways include glycolysis (150 genes), tricarboxylic acid cycle (89 genes), and pentose phosphate cycle (66 genes) pathways. The dataset also showed that the annotated sequences in the rest of three primary metabolic pathways have 0 to 25 singletons matching each gene (see Additional file 10). The shikimic acid pathway and the general phenylpropanoid pathway were the intermediate pathways of known topology involved in providing precursors for biosynthesis of flavonoids. A total of 114 unigenes were annotated in 16 enzymes that are involved in shikimic acid or aromatic amino acid pathway. Other 32 unigenes were involved in the general phenylpropanoid pathway and these unigenes might be involved in lignin biosynthesis (Additional file 10). The secondary metabolic pathways were selected, in which the simple six-carbon structure of hexoses were converted into a more complex 6:3:6 basic carbon structure of flavonoids. In the annotated P. bretschneideri transcriptome dataset, multiple unigenes encoding almost all known enzymes that are involved in main flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were identified (Additional file 10). All unigenes searched against the transcriptome database of P. bretschneideri will facilitate functional genomic studies and are particularly valuable for identifying genes or markers used for molecular breeding of pear species.",

Some genes involved in the process of fruit maturation have this kind of expression patterns, such as SPS, starch synthase, alkaline invertase (Alnv), phosphofructokinase, maltose transporter that are related to starch and sucrose metabolism, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (anthocyanin and lignin metabolism), expansin (cell wall loosening protein), and ACC oxidase (ethylene biosynthesis).

Obviously, the length and completeness of the assembled unigenes were one main factor, which can be seen from the increasing proportion of sequences with matches in the NR database as the length of uingenes increased ( Figure 3A) . However, the assembled unigenes shorter than 500 bp added up to 64,812 (71.8% of all 90,227 assembled unigenes) ( Figure 2B ), and some of them were too short to allow statistically meaningful matches.

A decrease of soluble AIV activity was correlated with a rapid increase of sucrose during fruit maturation in Japanese pear [55, 56] . SS is involved in the movement of sucrose to diverse pathways important for metabolic structure and storage functions in plant cells [57] . It has been reported that SS plays a role in sucrose cleavage rather than sucrose synthesis [58, 59] ; however, one report suggested that SS was also involved in sucrose synthesis in mature peach fruit where a high level of sucrose was accumulated [60] . In pear fruit, SS also appears to be involved in sucrose synthesis since SS activity increased along with a sucrose accumulation in pear fruit [60] . Recent research in potato also showed that SS strongly determines the intracellular levels of UDP-glucose, ADP-glucose, and starch, and total yield in potato tubers [61] . SPS also plays a major role in sucrose biosynthesis. Both SPS and SS are two important determinants of sucrose accumulation in Asian pear fruit. In 23 pear cultivars, the activity of SS was closely correlated with sucrose content, while SPS showed a weak correlation [60] .",

Sorbitol is converted into other sugars in the fruit by sorbitol-metabolizing enzymes, in which sorbitol oxidase and NAD-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase are two major players [62, 63] . Research also revealed that three gene families, sorbitol transport (SOT), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), and sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (S6PDH), showed more impacts on sugar metabolism in pear than in non-rosaceous species [64] . Wu et al. (2013) [64] identified four S6PDH genes through genome sequencing; however, no unigenes coding S6PDH were detected in this study. This may be caused by the difference in gene assembly or annotation. Yamaki and Moriguchi (1989) reported that NAD-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase that converts sorbitol to fructose showed a high activity throughout the entire fruit developing period in Japanese pear fruit. However, the activity of sorbitol oxidase activity that is about one-tenth of NADdependent sorbitol dehydrogenase, was high in immature fruit, but decreased during the fruit expansion period and increased again during the fruit maturation stage [63] . In peach fruit, sorbitol oxidase activity was relatively high, but other sorbitol-related enzymes were barely detectable [65] .",

In plants, regulation of starch metabolism is complex. In synthesis of starch, ADP-glucose was the glucosyl donor for the elongation of \u03b1-1, 4-glucosidic chains [66] . The first committed step is ADP-glucose synthesis that is catalyzed by ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGlc PPase) [67] . As a glucose donor, ADPG molecule is transferred to non-reducing end of the (1-4) glucan primer by starch synthase catalyses, thus formation of a long-chain amylase. Ghosh and Preiss (1966) showed that the reaction catalyzed by ADPGlc PPase is a regulation step in starch synthesis in higher plants as well as in the cyanobacteria [68] [69] [70] . Most of the plant ADPGlc PPases are allosterically regulated by 3-PGA and inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) [69, 70] . Some reports also suggested that in higher plants the enzyme activity can also be regulated by its reductive state [71] [72] [73] .",

                "text": "In this study, multiple unigenes in the main flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were annotated according to KEGG ( Figure 6B ). Flavonoids including phenylpropanoids, flavones, flavonols, and anthocyanins are important secondary metabolites that are directly involved in the development of fruit quality, such as color, flavor, and health beneficial ingredients [1, 46, 74] . These compounds are also involved in the formation of undesirable brown pigments in fruits following bruising or cutting and/or storage [75] . Information on phenylpropanoid metabolism in pear is limited. Nishitani et al. (2010) have studied the importance of phenylpropanoid metabolism in pear fruit ripening using oligoarray analysis [75] . In present study, a large number (497) of unigenes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were detected. Lignin biosynthesis in the phenylpropanoid pathway is one of the important factors for pear fruit quality. Lignin is the primary component of stone cells in pear fruit [76] and its synthesis has direct influence on formation and content of stone cells, ultimately influencing pear fruit quality [64] . Anthocyanin biosynthesis is essential for fruit coloration. Red coloration is determined by the content and composition of anthocyanins in the fruit skin [77] . Most enzymes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in pears are well studied [76] . For example, Feng et al. (2010) reported that anthocyanin biosynthesis in pears is regulated by a R2R3-MYB transcription factor PyMYB10 [78] .",

                "text": "Comparative analysis showed that dehydration-responsive protein RD22 was significantly up-regulated in pear fruit between FS3 and FS2 and significantly down-regulated between the FS3 and FS2 libraries. This showed that this gene involved in the whole expansion stage of pear fruit, so we infer that it may play important roles in the process of pear fruit growth and development. Although some research reported that dehydration-responsive protein RD22 was related to stress/defense response [80] [81] [82] . The role of this gene in pear fruit development remains unknown. AP2 was well known for its roles in floral organ identity and develop. In this study, we found that AP2 domain class transcription factor was significantly down-regulated and up-regulated in the fruit developmental stage of FS3/FS2 and FS5/FS4, respectively, which indicated that the AP2 domain class transcription factor was involved in fruit growth and development in pear. Recent research showed that AP2 was involved in many aspects of fruit development in other species. For example, Chung et al. (2010) proved that a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) APE-TALA2/ERF gene (SlAP2a) is a negative regulator of fruit ripening [83] . AP2 genes are also involved in seed mass and yield development via regulation of embryo cell number and cell size [84] . Rohrmann et al. (2011) reported that some genes in the AP2-EREBP family responsive to ethylene also showed the altered expression from the green fruit developmental stage onwards [85] . Ripoll et al. (2011) found that AP2 acts to prevent overgrowth of replum by negatively regulating BP and RPL, two genes that normally act to promote replum formation in Arabidopsis. AP2 also acts to prevent overgrowth of the valve margin by repressing the expression of the valve margin identity gene [86] . These studies indicated that AP2 domain class transcription factor is an important regulatory factor in fruit development. Other genes identified in this study, such as metallothionein-like protein type 3, nonspecific lipid-transfer protein precursor, cytochrome P450, zinc finger protein, prunin 2 precursor, flavonoid 3hydroxylase gene, CBF/DREB1 transcription factor, anthocyanidin synthase gene, etc. may have their own roles in the process of pear fruit growth and development. These roles need further verification.",

The results demonstrated the feasibility of using Illumina sequencing-based DGE system for gene expression profiling and provided new directions for functional analysis of genes involved in pear fruit development. These findings provide a substantial contribution to existing sequence resources of pear species and will certainly valuable for elucidation of molecular mechanisms in fruit development and maturation in pear or related species.

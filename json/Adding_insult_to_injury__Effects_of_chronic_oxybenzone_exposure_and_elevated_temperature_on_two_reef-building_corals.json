We studied the effect of chronic oxybenzone exposure and elevated water temperature on coral health.

After two weeks, half of the corals experienced a heat wave culminating at 33\u00b0C. All S. pistillata colonies survived the heat wave, although heat reduced growth and zooxanthellae density, irrespective of oxybenzone. Acropora tenuis survival decreased to 0% at 32\u00b0C, and oxybenzone accelerated mortality. Oxybenzone and heat significantly impacted photosynthetic yield in both species, causing a 5% and 22-33% decrease, respectively. In addition, combined oxybenzone and temperature stress altered the abundance of five bacterial families in the microbiome of S. pistillata. Our results suggest that oxybenzone adds insult to injury by further weakening corals in the face of global warming.",

Mass bleaching has devastating effects on coral reefs and their ecosystem services, which include coastal protection, fisheries and tourism (Moberg and Folke, 1999) . Coral bleaching occurs when seawater temperatures exceed a certain threshold, and involves the expulsion of symbiotic zooxanthellae, which inhabit the coral's gastroderm (Kleppel et al., 1989; Gates et al., 1992; Iglesiasprieto et al., 1992; Fitt et al., 2001 ). Corals do not survive long whilst in a bleached state, most likely due to energy limitation in the absence of photosynthesis (Glynn, 1984; Berkelmans et al., 2004) .",

Recently, Brown (2000) discussed the possibility that seawater warming and exposure to pollutant exposure may act additively or synergistically in the process of bleaching. Some explicit examples have been reported since. Morris et al. (2019) stated that although coral bleaching is predominantly attributed to photo-oxidative stress, nutrient availability and metabolism also underpin the stability of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis. Wooldridge and Done (2009) showed that corals growing in nutrient-enriched coastal waters had a decreased bleaching resistance compared to reefs in oligotrophic oceanic waters. In their study area, eutrophication effectively lowered the bleaching threshold by 1.0-1.5\u00b0C, possibly due to elevated zooxanthellae densities and subsequent higher production of reactive oxygen species. Lapointe et al. (2019) showed that an altered N:P stoichiometry can intensify the effects of high temperature on coral bleaching. Although herbicide levels were not field-relevant, Amid et al. (2018) observed combined effects of elevated temperature and herbicides on the photosynthetic capacity of Acropora formosa, indicating the relevance of studying multiple stressors simultaneously. Although these studies provide several examples of additive stress resulting in coral bleaching, research on the combined effects of water quality and water temperature on coral health remains limited (Ban et al., 2014 ).",

In marine waters, UV filters such as oxybenzone are generally found at levels in the order of ng L \u22121 (e.g. Tsui et al., 2014; Rodriguez et al., 2015) , but incidental concentrations of over 1 mg L \u22121 have been reported (Downs et al., 2016) . Oxybenzone is moderately lipophilic (log K ow = 3.79, log 10 BAF 2.21-3.01, Tsui et al., 2017) and has been shown to bioaccumulate in clams, urchins and prawns, reaching levels up to ng/g dry weight (Ramos et al., 2015) . As oxybenzone and other UV filters recently have been found in wild coral tissue samples at levels up to 38.4 ng/g wet weight in Hong Kong (Tsui et al., 2017) and up to 241 ng/g dry weight in coral tissues of Hawaii (Mitchelmore et al., 2019) , it is vital that the environmental consequences of UV filters are studied in more detail.",

This mechanism seems similar to the effects elevated seawater temperatures and high light intensity (Dove et al., 2006) . During heat and/or light stress, the core photosynthetic machinery within the zooxanthellae known as photosystem II (PSII) becomes less efficient at utilising light energy (Warner et al., 1996; Hill et al., 2009) , which is possibly due to ROS causing damage to PSII (Dove et al., 2006) . Oxybenzone exposure may increase the ROS pool within coral tissue and zooxanthellae, aggravating the detrimental effects of elevated temperatures on coral reefs. Although Danovaro et al. (2008) describe the promotion of bleaching by oxybenzone through induction of a viral lytic cycle in zooxanthellae, we observed sudden necrosis in corals after exposure to oxybenzone during preliminary studies in our lab (unpublished data T. Wijgerde). This observation, together with the report of Danovaro et al. (2008) , might be indicative of a compromised microbiome. A compromised microbiome may alter the physiology of the coral holobiont. For example, changes in the microbiome can impair the coral's ability to fix nitrogen, which could be detrimental as corals usually inhabit oligotrophic reef waters (van Oppen and Blackall, 2019) .",

We tested the hypothesis that oxybenzone-exposed corals are more sensitive to elevated seawater temperatures compared to corals growing in clean seawater, expressed by an earlier onset of bleaching and necrosis, reduced growth and an altered microbiome composition. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report on the combined effects of chronic oxybenzone exposure at field-relevant levels and elevated temperatures on coral microcolonies. This study contributes to a better understanding of the interplay between oxybenzone pollution and global warming in terms of coral health, allowing policy makers to re-evaluate the use of UV filters in sunscreens and industrial products.",

For each species, coral fragments (n = and n = 60 for S. pistillata and A. tenuis, respectively) were cut from a single parent colony and vertically glued onto 5 \u00d7 5 cm PVC tiles (Wageningen UR, The Netherlands) using two-component epoxy resin (Tunze Aquarientechnik GmbH, Germany). Only the growing tips were cut, resulting in uniform fragments of roughly cm in length. All fragments were allowed to recover for 4 weeks in a 550 L holding aquarium before the onset of the 6-week experiment. The holding aquarium was provided with full spectrum white light at an irradiance of 300 \u03bcmol m \u22122 s \u22121 (12 h:12 h light:dark regime), created by three 190 W LED fixtures (CoralCare, Philips Lighting, The Netherlands). Water flow was provided by several Turbelle nanostream 6085 circulation pumps (Tunze Aquarientechnik GmbH, Germany). Artificial seawater (ASW) for the holding aquarium was prepared using Zoo Mix artificial sea salt (Tropic Marin GmbH, Germany) and deionised water. This mixture was aerated at least 48 h prior to use. Salinity was kept at 35 g L \u22121 (psu), water temperature at 26\u00b0C, pH at 7.8-8.2, alkalinity at 2.5 mEq L \u22121 , calcium at 380-420 mg L \u22121 , nitrate at 0-0.25 mg L \u22121 and phosphate at 0-0.05 mg L \u22121 . Salinity was measured with a conductivity meter (WTW, Germany), alkalinity was measured with a titralab AT1000 titrator (Hach, Germany). Calcium was measured with an EDTA titration kit (Salifert, The Netherlands). Nitrate and phosphate were measured with colorimetric kits (Red Sea, Israel). The detection range of the phosphate kit was 0-5 mg L \u22121 , with a 0.01 mg L \u22121 accuracy. For the nitrate kit, these values were 0-64 mg L \u22121 and 0.125 mg L \u22121 . The pH was monitored with a pH controller (Resun, China). Every week, 20% of the aquarium water was exchanged to maintain sufficient trace element concentrations. Corals were fed daily with newly hatched brine shrimp (Artemia salina), at an end concentration of approximately 250 individuals L \u22121 . The aquarium was kept free of algae with five herbivorous fish (two Zebrasoma flavescens, one Acanthurus triostegus, one Ctenochaetus strigosus and one Siganus vulpinus), and free of anemones with one Chaetodon auriga. Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup in which a 2 \u00d7 2 experimental design was used, with two temperature regimes (heat wave and control, see further below), with and without oxybenzone exposure. To prevent pseudoreplication, the setup contained 5 independent 12L flow-through aquaria for each of the 4 experimental treatments, totalling 20 aquaria. For each temperature regime, one basin with 10 partially submerged aquaria was supplied with a 300 W heater connected to a digital thermostat (Conrad, The Netherlands). To create the heat wave, the digital thermostat of one basin was increased stepwise over a period of three weeks, according to Fig. S1 , with water temperatures rising from 26\u00b0C to 33\u00b0C. The other basin was kept at 26\u00b0C throughout the experiment. Two L/h circulation pumps (Tunze, Germany) in each basin prevented the formation of a temperature gradient between the individual aquaria. Within each aquarium, a circulation pump (300 L/h, Eheim, Germany) was placed as well. The light regime was kept the same as in the holding tank, here created by eight 190 W LED fixtures (CoralCare, Philips Lighting, The Netherlands). The LED lights were dimmed to 80% of their maximum power and adjusted in such a way that irradiance differences between the 20 aquaria were \u00b1 \u03bcmol m \u22122 s \u22121 . The same ASW as used for the holding tank was used for the aquaria, which was again aerated at least 48 h prior to use. Three Acropora tenuis microcolonies were put into each 12L aquarium, as this species was considered to be highly sensitive. Only one Stylophora pistillata microcolony was introduced in each aquarium. Pre-aerated ASW was pumped to the 20 aquaria from two separate 225L header tanks, which contained either control or oxybenzonespiked ASW (see below for details), using peristaltic pumps (Cole-Parmer, USA). As the corals and algae growing in the 12L aquaria consume significant amounts of nutrients, spiking in the header tanks was required to prevent coral bleaching and necrosis due to lack of nutrients. Therefore, inorganic nutrients were added to both header tanks. Sodium nitrate (NaNO , VWR, The Netherlands) and sodium hydrogen phosphate (Na HPO 4, VWR, The Netherlands), were added to reach concentrations of 0.5 mg L \u22121 as NO 3 \u2212 and 0.05 mg L \u22121 as PO 4 3\u2212 .",

For each sample and corresponding negative controls, 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR using the following primers: 27F_BCtail-FW (TTTCTGTTGGTGCTGATAT TGC_AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) and 1492R_BCtail-RV (ACTTGCCTG TCGCTCTATCTTC_CGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT), each containing an 5\u2032 extension allowing for subsequent barcoding by PCR, and Phire Tissue direct PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher) using the following amplification cycles: 3 min at 98\u00b0C, 30 cycles of 8 s at 98\u00b0C; 8 s at 58\u00b0C; 30s at 72\u00b0C, final extension of 3 min at 72\u00b0C. Obtained amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Amplicons for each sample were barcoded using the Oxford Nanopore \"PCR Barcoding Expansion Pack 1-96 (EXP-PBC096)\", and sequenced on the MinION according to manufacturers \"1D PCR barcoding (96) genomic DNA (SQK-LSK108)\" protocol (Oxford Nanopore Technologies).",

The Fastq 16S workflow revision 3.2.0 with the 16S classification version 3.0.0 were used on the Oxford Nanopore Epi2me platform (Metrichor, Oxford, UK; https://epi2me.nanoporetech.com) to classify raw sequences. A taxonomic hierarchy of all the classified taxa was obtained using the Entrez Taxonomy NCBI database and the taxize package in R (Chamberlain and Szocs, 2018) , which was used to generate an OTU table on order, family and genus level. The microbiome sequence data for this study have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under accession number PRJEB35701. Data visualisation and statistical tests were performed using the vegan (Oksanen et al., 2018) , ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and phyloseq (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013) packages. Alpha diversity (within-sample diversity) was calculated using two indices: observed OTU richness and ACE (abundance-based coverage estimator). To test for differences in alpha diversity between temperature and oxybenzone treatments, a generalised linear model with a negative binomial distribution was fitted to the data. To assess differences in beta diversity (between-sample diversity) with temperature and oxybenzone treatments, Bray-Curtis (Bray and Curtis, 1957) dissimilarities were calculated. These metrics were then visualised with a Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) plot and compared in a permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with 9999 permutations. All data conformed to the underlying assumptions of PERMANOVA, with multivariate spread being equal among groups (similar to homogeneity of variances in an ANOVA, Anderson, 2017) . Families that showed significant differences in abundance between temperature and oxybenzone treatments were determined using the DESeq2 package (Love et al., 2014) with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values.",

As only one Stylophora pistillata microcolony was put into each aquarium, no pooling was required for this species. Normality of data was first tested by plotting residuals of each dataset versus predicted values, and by performing a Shapiro-Wilk test. Homogeneity of variances was determined using Levene's test. All data were found to be normally distributed and showed homogeneity of variances (p N 0.050) after arcsine transformation (for PSII yield). When the assumption of sphericity, tested with Mauchly's test, was violated, degrees of freedom were adjusted using Greenhouse-Geisser. We used a three-way mixed factorial ANOVA to test the effects of temperature, oxybenzone exposure and time on effective and maximum PSII yield of S. pistillata and A. tenuis, with temperature and oxybenzone as between-subjects factors and time as within-subjects factor. Simple effects analysis was used to break down interactive effects. A two-way factorial ANOVA was used to determine the effects of temperature and oxybenzone exposure on specific growth rate and zooxanthellae density of S. pistillata. Due to lack of surviving A. tenuis samples in the heat wave group at the end of the experiment, data for SGR and zooxanthellae density could not be analysed for this species. A p b 0.050 value was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM, Somers, USA). Graphs were plotted with SigmaPlot 14 (Systat software, San Jose, USA). Data presented are expressed as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (s.e.m.), unless stated otherwise.",

All S. pistillata microcolonies survived the experiment. At the end of the experiment (Day 41), S. pistillata colonies growing at 33\u00b0C exhibited signs of bleaching ( Fig. 2a) . A distinct green colouration at the tips became apparent, probably due to green fluorescent protein production. Survival of A. tenuis stabilised at 67% for the 26\u00b0C treatment without oxybenzone (Fig. 3) . High temperatures markedly affected A. tenuis survival, with corals exposed to the heat wave without oxybenzone exhibiting a gradual decrease in survival rate over time and a steep decline towards 0% survival at 32\u00b0C, between Day 32 and 33 ( Figs. 2b and  3 ). In the 26\u00b0C treatments, the effective and maximum PSII yield were constant for both coral species over the full experimental period of days (Fig. 4) . Temperature increase negatively affected effective PSII yield in both species. For S. pistillata, an interactive effect of temperature treatment and time on effective PSII yield was found (Fig. 4a , Table S1 ). Up to Day 24 (29\u00b0C), PSII yield remained constant (simple effects, p N 0.05). However, from Day 31 onwards (31.5\u00b0C), a consistent reduction in effective PSII yield was detectable, with a 33% decrease at Day 41 as compared to the control temperature (simple effects, p b 0.05, Fig. 4a ). The 26\u00b0C treatment showed a consistent yield over time, with no temperature effect (simple effects, p N 0.05, Fig. 4a ). For A. tenuis, no statistical effect of temperature could be calculated as the corals died during the heat wave. The data, however, show that effective PSII yield of the last surviving corals was reduced by 22% at Day 32 (32\u00b0C, Fig. 4b ). The effect of temperature on maximum PSII yield of S. pistillata was also found to depend on time (Table S1 ). Up to Day 20, (28\u00b0C), no decrease in maximum PSII yield was found. However, from Day 27 onwards (30.5\u00b0C), a consistent reduction in maximum PSII yield was detectable, with a decrease of 26% at day 41 as compared to the 26\u00b0C treatment (simple effects, p b 0.05, Fig. 4c ). Again, the 26\u00b0C treatment showed a consistent maximum yield over time, with no temperature effect (simple effects, p N 0.05; Fig. 4c ). For A. tenuis, the maximum PSII yield was reduced by 12% at Day 27 (30.5\u00b0C, Fig. 4d ), although not significant (Table S1 ). The growth of S. pistillata microcolonies was inhibited by 50% during the heat wave (Days 16-41, Fig. 5 ). Zooxanthellae density in S. pistillata decreased by 71% at Day 41 (33\u00b0C, Fig. 6 ). Zooxanthellae density and growth rate in A. tenuis could not be determined because all microcolonies had died during the heat wave. Only minor effects of oxybenzone exposure alone on both species were observed, for a limited number of parameters. A main effect of oxybenzone on effective PSII yield of both species was found, with a consistent 5% reduction throughout the experiment as compared to controls (Fig. 4a, b , Table S1 ). Maximum PSII yield was affected by oxybenzone for Stylophora pistillata only, with a 4% reduction throughout the experiment (Fig. 4c, Table 1 ). Oxybenzone did not affect the survival, growth rate and zooxanthellae density of S. pistillata (Table S1 , Figs. 5-6). Survival of A. tenuis at 26\u00b0C was hardly affected by oxybenzone (Fig. 3) . For A. tenuis, zooxanthellae density and growth rate could not be determined due to observed mortality.",

Although a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis distance at order, family or genus level showed no clear pattern (Fig. S3, family level shown only) , a PERMANOVA on microbiome beta diversity revealed a significant interactive effect of temperature and oxybenzone (Table S2) . On family level, the relative abundance of the families Hyphomonadaceae, Nocardioidaceae and Sinobacteraceae had declined in the combined stressor exposure (Fig. 7 , Table S3 ). As a result of oxybenzone exposure, the Verrucomicrobiaceae had increased, but only at 26\u00b0C (Fig. 7) . Elevated temperature only resulted in increased abundance of Deinococcaceae (Fig. 7) . On genus level, combined exposure to heat stress and oxybenzone resulted in a similar pattern as seen at family level, with reduced abundance of 10 genera and increased abundance of only one genus (Marivita, Fig. S4 ).",

The chosen nominal level of oxybenzone was a field-relevant concentration of 1 \u03bcg L \u22121 and the redosing of oxybenzone was designed to keep the compound concentration within a reasonable range. To check the actual concentrations water samples were analysed weekly. This revealed that the exposure concentration throughout the experiment was much lower than anticipated, being on average 0.06 \u03bcg L \u22121 . The difference can be explained by the relatively lipophilic nature of oxybenzone with a log 10 K ow of 3.79 (Tsui et al., 2017) . Thus, oxybenzone may have adhered to the plastic tubing used to pump seawater to the aquaria, as well as to the plastic Table 1 Overview of observed effects of chronic oxybenzone exposure and the heat wave on two reef-building coral species.

After uptake by the coral, it is likely that corals metabolize oxybenzone to benzophenone-1 and benzophenone-8 (Kim and Choi, 2014; Tsui et al., 2017) . Interestingly, He et al. (2019) found coral species to be more sensitive to BP-8 than to oxybenzone. As we neither measured BP-1 nor BP-8 levels, neither in the aquaria nor in the corals, we cannot exclude that the observed effects in our study resulted from these metabolites. We do show, however, that chronic exposure to an even 20 times lower oxybenzone level (60 ng L \u22121 ) than originally planned, does induce adverse effects. Field-relevant levels found at locations near coral reefs across the world are in the range of 10 ng L \u22121 with maxima up to 1.5 \u03bcg L \u22121 (e.g. Tashiro and Kameda, 2013; Tsui et al., 2014; Schaap and Slijkerman, 2018) . The adverse effects observed in this laboratory study might thus not be excluded in field situations for which chronic exposure to oxybenzone exists.",

They also provided evidence for a link between lower energy acquisition (lower total lipid content) due to PSII photoinhibition and a 6-fold reduced reproductive output (in terms of polyp fecundity) in zooxanthellate corals in an experimental setting. In our study, oxybenzone exposure at a level of 0.06 \u03bcg L \u22121 resulted in a PSII yield reduction of 4-5% in both species. Although we did not assess coral energy acquisition and reproductive output, we cannot exclude a negative long-term impact on metabolism, with decreased growth and reproductive capacity. Although we did not observe a significant effect on coral growth, a trend with 16% growth reduction in oxybenzoneexposed corals was found, possibly caused by PSII inhibition. Significant growth inhibition cannot be excluded at higher oxybenzone levels, longer exposure intervals or more sensitive coral species. The ecological and economic consequences of coral growth inhibition could be severe, as currently some reefs already cannot outgrow sea-level rise, posing a critical threat to the adjacent coastal region (De Bakker et al., 2019) . Additional studies should focus on impaired PSII and related growth inhibition by UV filter exposure in more detail in order to evaluate its ecological significance.",

The heat wave without oxybenzone treatment resulted in elevated abundance of the bacterial family Deinococcaceae. In contrast, oxybenzone exposure resulted in elevated abundance of Verrucomicrobiaceae, but not at elevated seawater temperature. Combined exposure to oxybenzone and elevated temperature resulted in decreased abundance of Hyphomonadaceae, Nocardioidaceae and Sinobacteraceae, as well as decreased abundance of 10 genera. The observed limited effects of temperature alone is in agreement with the study of Gardner et al. (2019) , who found a conservative within-species microbial community in the Seychelles during a thermal bleaching event. Our study suggests that multistressor conditions, in our case elevated temperature and oxybenzone exposure, lead to a stronger shift within the coral microbiome. The significance of microbial changes in terms of coral health is not clear yet, although it is possible that many physiological and immunological processes within the coral holobiont are affected. The importance of the microbiome to coral health, including its role in allowing corals to adapt to environmentally stressful situations, has been described by several authors (Gardner et al., 2019; Glasl et al., 2016; Peixoto et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2017; Grottoli et al., 2018) . Indeed, environmental stress resulting in coral bleaching, tissue necrosis and mortality is often accompanied by a shift in the microbiome (Glasl et al., 2016; Zaneveld et al., 2017) . Bulleri et al. (2018) found that coral recruitment is negatively correlated with the abundance of Verrucomicrobiaceae, and Closek et al. (2014) found Verrucomicrobiaceae exclusively in corals suffering from yellow band-disease. The fact that these bacteria are associated with negative conditions does however not make clear whether these bacteria cause coral disease or opportunistically increase in abundance due to impaired holobiont health. Whether the increase of Verrucomicrobiaceae in the oxybenzone treated corals benefited from an impaired holobiont, or had a steering role in the observed decreased health can thus not yet be elucidated. Generally, the various roles of coral-associated bacteria under healthy, stable conditions and in diseased states remains a critical knowledge gap. Functional gene analysis using metagenomics (Thurber et al., 2009) and transcriptomics (Miller et al., 2011) , in combination with multifactorial laboratory experiments, may shed more light on how the coral holobiont responds to chronic stressors such as oxybenzone.",

Therefore, oxybenzone adds insult to injury by further weakening corals in the face of climate change. Future experiments should involve long-term oxybenzone exposure to assess cumulative effects, and should include more species, genotypes and life stages to better estimate the impact on coral reef health. In addition, a better understanding of the mechanisms through which oxybenzone affects corals, their zooxanthellae and their microbiome is important. ",

    "abstract": "Relationships between corals and specific bacterial associates are thought to play an important role in coral health. In this study, the specificity of bacteria associating with the coral Pocillopora meandrina was investigated by exposing coral embryos to various strains of cultured marine bacteria, sterile seawater, or raw seawater and examining the identity, density, and location of incorporated cells. The isolates utilized in this experiment included members of the Roseobacter and SAR11 clades of the Alphaproteobacteria, a Pseudoalteromonas species of the Gammaproteobacteria, and a Synechococcus species of the Cyanobacteria phylum. Based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of small-subunit rRNA genes, similarities in bacterial communities associated with 170-hold planulae were observed regardless of treatment, suggesting that bacteria may have been externally associated from the outset of the experiment. Microscopic examination of P. meandrina planulae by fluorescence in situ hybridization with bacterial and Roseobacter clade-specific oligonucleotide probes revealed differences in the densities and locations of planulae-associated cells. Planulae exposed to either raw seawater or strains of Pseudoalteromonas and Roseobacter harbored the highest densities of internally associated cells, of which 20 to 100% belonged to the Roseobacter clade. Planulae exposed to sterile seawater or strains of the SAR11 clade and Synechococcus did not show evidence of prominent bacterial associations. Additional analysis of the raw-seawater-exposed planulae via electron microscopy confirmed the presence of internally associated prokaryotic cells, as well as virus-like particles. These results suggest that the availability of specific microorganisms may be an important factor in the establishment of coral-bacterial relationships.",

This complex community of organisms, referred to as the coral holobiont, is hypothesized to work together to maintain the healthy functioning of individual coral colonies (22, 49) . A current challenge in coral biological research is to understand how the different components of the coral holobiont function, both independently and collectively, to create a healthy, functioning colony. The study of microorganisms (defined here as bacteria and archaea) associated with corals has been greatly advanced by the use of cultivationindependent approaches, and numerous studies have now highlighted the abundance and diversity of microbes associated with adult corals (48, 54) . These microorganisms are hypothesized to play a role in the transfer of potentially sparse nutrients to the coral organism (31, 62) and the production of probiotic compounds (19, 44) .",

These microhabitats provide unique niches that are undoubtedly favorable to particular microbial functions and, therefore, may harbor specific assemblages of microorganisms. The application of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to examine the proximity of microorganisms to the coral's cellular architecture provides one means to assess how specific microbial taxa physically associate with the coral and offers a framework for examining taxon-specific microbial interactions within the holobiont. To date, only a few studies have localized individual microbial cells within the coral holobiont using FISH techniques (2) (3) (4) (5) 13) .",

For example, the Gammaproteobacteria species PA1 was shown to be widely distributed with the coral Porites astreoides-a relationship maintained over thousands of kilometers (49) . However, the mechanisms that corals utilize to preserve specific associations with microorganisms are not well understood. Many invertebrates maternally transmit microbial symbionts to their offspring in order to ensure the longevity of the association, and this mechanism provides opportunities for coevolution and codiversification of the hosts and their symbionts (41) . Horizontal transmission of microorganisms from the environment is also a well-utilized mechanism for acquiring symbionts (20, 39, 45) . These relationships are also frequently species specific and require the availability of symbionts from the environment and for both partners to be actively involved in the symbiont incorporation process (39) . Additionally, the accessibility of certain symbionts from the environment may be reliant on particular conditions.",

Additionally, electron microscopy was utilized to examine the specific location of microbial cells in relation to the larval coral tissues.

Incubation with raw seawater, Roseobacter clade strain HIMB1, and Pseudoalteromonas strain HIMB1276 resulted in planulae containing prominent, internally associated microbial cells, while planulae incubated with sterile seawater, Synechococcus strain HIMB12, and SAR11 strain HIMB4 did not. These results suggest that the establishment of this intimate association is not passive and that the planula, bacterium, or both play an active role. Specific host-microbial relationships have been documented for a variety of organisms (38, 39) , including associations between corals and Symbiodinium (1, 29, 50, 53) . Corals possess an innate immune system which functions primarily in self-or nonself-recognition (36) . Thus, some mechanism of recognition must exist in order to determine which bacterial cells can cross the coral epithelium. Proteins involved in pattern recognition may play a role in facilitating specific bacterial cells to cross into the epithelium of P. meandrina (26, 27) , and further investigation of these mechanisms is important for understanding the initiation of any coral-microbial relationship. Planulae exposed to Roseobacter clade strain HIMB1 formed the most prominent internal bacterial associations, which was somewhat surprising due to the planktonic lifestyle of this isolate. However, marine roseobacters represent a diverse group of bacteria that possess a variety of physiologies and have been previously found in internal associations with developing P. meandrina (6) and Porites astreoides (51) . Members of the Roseobacter clade also frequently form relationships with adult corals (14, 16, 21, 23, 24, 30, 33, 48, 54, 55) , but it is unclear how this specificity translates into homogeneous or heterogeneous roles within the coral holo- biont. Members of this important group of marine bacteria are known to perform a variety of distinct functions (12, 37) , including the consumption of the organic sulfur metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate, which is abundantly secreted by coral zooxanthellae (11, 18) , and the production of probiotic compounds (33, 49) .",

Interestingly, it was isolated from the coral Pocillopora damicornis, which belongs to the same genus of coral as utilized in this study. Thus, this isolate appears to harbor a host-associated lifestyle. Planulae exposed to Pseudoalteromonas strain HIMB1276 primarily harbored cells in the outermost edge of the ectoderm, and it is possible that these cells played a direct or indirect role in the settlement or adhesion processes of the planulae. Microbial biofilms on benthic substrates can attract and/or promote settlement of coral larvae, presumably through the production of chemical signals (42, 60, 61) . In fact, a strain of Pseudoalteromonas appears to be involved in the metamorphosis of an acroporid coral (42) . During the course of our experiment, planulae exposed to Pseudoalteromonas strain HIMB1276 tended to settle onto the surface of the petri dish (data not shown). Future studies are necessary to investigate the specific role of Pseudoalteromonas strain HIMB1276 and other members of the Pseudoalteromonas genus with developing corals and whether or not these associations persist in adults. Investigations examining their role in the settlement process, such as their ability to produce or detect chemical signals, may be particularly worthwhile.",

These cells potentially originate from surface (mucus) associations with the embryos and are later incorporated into the ectodermal tissues during development. While Roseobacter and other bacterial cells were not observed to be externally or internally associated with 4-h embryos, it is possible that external associations may be disrupted while preparing samples for FISH. In addition, it is also feasible that the Roseobacter clade cells originated from the freeliving bacterioplankton community and were not removed during the rinsing process prior to establishing the treatments. Despite daily water changes of sterile-seawater medium, the sterile-seawater treatment showed evidence of a small community of microbial cells after 72 h (with sterile water changes every 24 h) of exposure to the planulae. Both of these scenarios may explain why, following planula exposure, the free-living bacterial communities often contained multiple community members that were similar despite differences in the treatments. The planulae were not treated with antibiotics prior to incubation with the various microbial strains and seawater treatments, which might have been useful to remove loosely associated bacterial cells and obtain barren embryos.",

While the SSU rRNA gene T-RF pattern representing the genus Jannaschia (F-191 and R-178) was detected in the planulae reared with Roseobacter clade strain HIMB1 and Pseudoalteromonas strain HIMB1276, it was not detected within the bacterial community associated with planulae reared in the raw-seawater treatment. However, the T-RF pattern broadly associated with the majority of members of the Roseobacter clade (F-34 and R-91/-92) was prominently associated. Thus, this study provides support for the hypothesis that members of the Roseobacter clade are important for developing corals. Because the T-RFLP analysis method used here provides relatively low taxonomic resolution and is not able to differentiate between most subclades within the Roseobacter clade, additional analysis of the identity of the specific community members is needed to further examine the specificity of the Roseobacter clade cells associating with P. meandrina planulae. While it should be noted that the potential for cross-contamination was present due to the employment of a member of the Roseobacter clade possessing the T-RF pattern F-34 and R-91 as a treatment (HIMB1), this scenario is highly unlikely because the experimental setup limited the opportunity for contaminating exposure.",

In this study, we found that the taxonomic composition of free-living, planktonic bacteria influences the frequency and nature of bacterial cell incorporation by P. meandrina planulae. We provide additional evidence that the Roseobacter clade of marine Alphaproteobacteria appear particularly adept at forming intimate relationships with developing P. meandrina, making it important to understand how these particular bacteria influence the development, settlement, or health of the coral. Field studies investigating the nature of microorganisms associating with developing corals will undoubtedly be useful to verify laboratorybased results. Additionally, assessing the persistence of association between microorganisms and developing corals with time is necessary to address whether the relationship is opportunistic or more intimate in nature. Finally, we anticipate that continued investigation of how developing P. meandrina organisms respond to altered communities of bacterioplankton will lead to important insights regarding the ability of corals to develop, metamorphose, and endure as adult colonies in a changing marine environment.",

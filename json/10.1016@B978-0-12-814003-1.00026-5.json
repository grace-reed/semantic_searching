    "abstract": "The protection of coral reefs begins on land. This is true for reefs that are both adjacent to coasts as well as those over 100 km from shore. The problem lies in reductions of water and substratum quality from watershed discharges, and the effects on coral reef health and resilience. Such discharges can carry large volumes of freshwater, a variety of toxicants, sediment, nutrients, bacteria, and solid waste. Each of these elements, individually or in concert, interferes with key processes critical to the survival of coral reef ecosystems. The two key processes responsible for the persistence of coral reefs over time, reproduction and recruitment, are chemically mediated. Subtle changes in water and bottom quality can have major effects on the success of these two linked elements of reef population replenishment. Reproduction is the process by which new individuals are produced from prior stock. In corals, reproduction can occur as a result of both sexual (fusion of sperm and egg) and asexual (parthenogenesis, fragmentation, tissue sloughing, polyp bailout) means. In sexual reproduction, fertilized eggs develop into larvae called planulae over a period ranging from about 18 h to 3 days, depending on the size of the egg and physical factors such as temperature and salinity. The resulting planula larvae are dispersed via currents, and while many coral reefs are \"self-seeded\" with larvae from the natal reef, others are repopulated by larvae that can traverse long distances with competency periods exceeding 100 days, creating connectivity among distant reef ecosystems. Asexual propagules, such as fragments and bits of ciliated tissue formed from a shedding process called \"polyp bail out,\" have a limited dispersal range, and if they settle and survive, do so very close to the source. Successful sexual reproduction is critical to reef population maintenance, recovery, and resilience by adding an element of genetic variation not occurring in asexual processes, as well as producing seed material that can disperse over greater distances from a source site. Water quality and substratum conditions are major factors affecting the success of reproduction and recruitment in corals. There are six critical stages in these linked processes, which are all chemically mediated (Fig. 1): gamete development prior to spawning, synchronization of gamete release among coral colonies of the same species, egg-sperm interactions that lead to fertilization of eggs, embryological development, substrate selection by competent larvae, and for most spawning species (as opposed to brooders), acquisition of symbiotic zooxanthellae, the single cell algae that provide much of a coral's daily energy needs. If any one of these key processes is affected, the natural replenishment of reef populations is prevented. During mass coral spawning events, large quantities of eggs and sperm are released into the water column. Typically, these gametes are released in combined egg-sperm bundles. The eggs are rich in lipid, which makes them float to the surface of the ocean, carrying the sperm along with them. Once at the surface, these bundles burst apart, allowing the eggs and sperm to interact on the sea surface. Experiments have demonstrated that rates of self-fertilization are usually very low, on the order of 2% or less, while outcrossing of sperm and eggs from different colonies of the same species result in much higher fertilization rates, often over 90%. Hybridization can also occur among closely related species. It is clear that chemical cueing is important for successful egg-sperm interactions, and reductions in water quality, including the reduction in salinity or the presence of toxicants and sediment can result in reproductive failure. Land-based sources of pollution (LBSP), directly caused by watershed discharges, have been identified by the US Coral Reef Task Force and other management-directed bodies as a primary cause of anthropogenic stress responsible for the decline of coral reefs worldwide. This is true for high islands and continental areas adjacent to coral reefs with well-defined Chapter 26",

The sediment and toxicant loads of discharges are tied to the specific activities that occur within watersheds, and the volume and velocity of flow in streams and rivers are directly related to the physical ground characteristics of permeability, rugosity, and slope. Reductions in the amounts of permeable surfaces through which rainwater can percolate are often a problem associated with housing, road, and industrial development. While agricultural development usually preserves permeable surfaces, alterations in plant ground cover and topography via plowing, terracing, and berm construction can enhance erosion and subsequent sedimentation. To prevent flooding, drainages within watersheds are often altered, with the increases in non-permeable surfaces adding substantial volume to runoff, and the straightening of streams and rivers, along with bottom hardening (lining channels with concrete) increases the velocity of water flow. Both of these activities result in greater impacts to coastal coral reefs and associated ecosystems, such as seagrass beds, than would occur under natural conditions.",

Watershed discharges can move materials including clay and colloidal-sized particles (<0.002 mm), silt (between 0.002 and 0.06 mm), sand (0.06-2 mm), gravel (2.0-63 mm), cobbles (63-200 mm) , and boulders (>200 mm).

The smallest particles, in the clay and colloidal size range, remain suspended the most in the water column and reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the corals. This turbidity cuts down the ability of the coral's algal symbionts, zooxanthellae, to photosynthesize and produce energy for the host coral. As light levels decrease, the algal symbionts shift from photosynthesis to photorespiration which may lead to oxidative stress in the host coral. Turbidity has a particularly negative metabolic effect on branching corals, as they have limited surface areas for light collection, and their colony morphology is more efficient at shedding particles of sediment. Plating and mounting corals are also affected by turbidity, but more so by the accumulation of particles including those in the sand size class that can be difficult to clear using mucus and cilia and may also be abrasive in the presence of wave action.",

Experiments showed that at sublethal levels, exposed larvae didn't settle and metamorphose, and if \"clean\" larvae were presented with appropriate substrata that had been exposed to this chemical, recruitment was also affected. Herbicides can affect corals and zooxanthellate larvae by interfering with the ability of the algal symbionts to photosynthesize. Some insecticides are endocrine disrupting compounds, and it is no surprise that they can interfere with reproduction in corals, as these organisms possess the same proteins and metabolic pathways as found in higher organisms.

They can alter the balance within the coral holobiont by increasing the division rate of zooxanthellae to the point where these algal cells become self-shading and the photosynthetic efficiency drops. At night, zooxanthellae respire oxygen and can cause oxidative stress in the coral host. Additionally, nutrients can alter another major component of the coral holobiont: bacteria. The important role of bacteria has been identified for providing recruitment cues for coral planula larvae, and for coral metabolism as has been determined in higher organisms. Nutrients also support the population growth of a variety of organisms that bio-erode corals and reef structures, such as sabellid and serpulid worms (\"feather duster\" and \"Christmas tree\" worms), boring sponges (clionids), and boring bivalves (e.g., Lithophaga). These organisms undermine the reef framework and accelerate the impacts of ocean acidification associated with climate change. Finally, there is a link between nutrients, plankton, and population outbreaks of the corallivorous Crown-of-Thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci, whose planktotrophic larvae benefit from increased food availability, which enhances their survival and recruitment rates.",

The same problems expressed regarding the effects of nutrients on the bacterial abundance and diversity patterns on coral reefs holds for antibiotics. As more knowledge is gained about the important role of bacteria for corals and coral reefs, from mediating recruitment of larvae to the metabolic role of these microorganisms for the coral holobiont, it will be imperative that management efforts include plans for reducing exposure to such bioactive compounds.

Annual rainfall values for any given watershed are not evenly distributed among days and months of the year, but rather, occur seasonally and in an episodic fashion. For example, a hurricane (typhoon or tropical cyclone) can dump over a meter of rainfall within several hours. These events can have drastic effects on coastal coral reefs and associated communities. From a biological perspective, these events can vastly overwhelm the organisms' ability to survive high levels of stress from salinity changes, toxicant levels, sediment loads, turbidity, and even temperature. Infrastructure has to be built, such as adequate water retention basins, which can address these larger storms to reduce the ecosystem damage associated with extreme events and enhance resilience of coastal marine communities.",

A study was performed on the use of taro fields as a buffer between land and sea, which included moving these higher up within watersheds. Measurements found that they trap between 60% and 90% of sediment in runoff, two to three times that of mangroves. The higher positioning within watershed reduced the volume and velocity of runoff and hence, the amount of sediment carried to the ocean. Two narrow channels constructed perpendicular to the fields trapped coarse and fine sediment, respectively, providing an easy means of harvesting this material for other purposes. By moving taro fields further up into watersheds, sedimentation impacts to coastal coral reefs have decreased, crops were protected from seawater inundation, and food security and cultural benefits have increased (Fig. 8 ) (Koshiba et al., 2014) .",

Bays act as bank accounts with regards to sediment, and the overall impacts over space and time are the result of the dynamics of deposits versus withdrawals. Thus, it is important to pair the responses to reduced inputs with those that facilitate flushing and reduce the problems associated with resuspension of accumulated materials. It is also important to reduce the magnitude of extreme events which can overwhelm the ability of corals to survive such pulses. The removal of benthic algae addressed the retention and resuspension issues, but not the flow of additional sediment into Maunalua Bay.

At all levels, community engagement was found to be a critical element for success.",

Bridging science and knowledge to policy is often a challenge, which in this case, was helped by the leadership of Palauan scientists who could present research findings in the Palauan language and in the appropriate cultural context. In addition to enhancing mangrove protections and using taro fields in a novel way, the Palauan government reviewed their existing regulatory framework and identified a problem with clearing and grading permits. Agricultural development was traditionally exempt from such permit requirements, which was appropriate when farms were small, at the family and community level. With the growing produce demands by the tourism sector, foreign-run commercial farms of hundreds of hectares or more sprang up, along with ineffective land-use practices.",

The first, and most obvious, is the need for integrated practices on land to reduce erosion of soils and prevent freshwater runoff, sediment, nutrients, and toxicants from reaching coastal and offshore coral reefs in the first place. These include onsite retention of water, improved agricultural practices, and protection of coastal mangroves and seagrass communities where they are part of the natural environment. Once sediment is deposited on coral reefs, resuspension causes a multiplier effect, whereas 1 kg of sediment can have the impact of tons. Benthic fleshy and filamentous algae become a reservoir for these sediments, reducing natural flushing rates, hence the value of protecting herbivores such as sea urchins and grazing species of fish. This requires cooperation of fishers, who need to understand the benefits associated with any sacrifice on their part. Voluntary compliance is a far more effective and efficient solution compared to using enforcement officers and the judicial system. Fishers, who understand the need for protecting populations of herbivorous reef fish, become part of the solution. Finally, the value of community engagement, outreach, and education is clear and essential for the success of watershed-based initiatives that support coral reef protection and recovery. Including and in some cases, revitalizing traditional cultural practices, such as the culture of taro, can be valuable approaches to improving watershed management, yielding multiple benefits to the participating communities.",

However, this global driver also affects the impacts of local stressors, particularly by increasing the magnitude of watershed discharges. Predictions of increasing storm strength have come true, with an expectation that the trend will continue in the future. The result is more extreme events with larger amounts of rainfall, which in turn, increase the spatial and temporal scale of runoff impacts that exceed the ability of corals and reef communities to survive. Each extreme event that exceeds the adaptive and acclimation capacities of corals and other reef organisms results in mortality, the loss of genetic diversity, and reduction in ecosystem resilience in both the short and long term.",

Public outreach and education of consumers can help reduce the amounts of toxicants such as pesticides, oil compounds, and personal care products that enter the coastal environment. Retention of rainwater at individual households and housing complexes can be achieved through the use of rain barrels and rain gardens.

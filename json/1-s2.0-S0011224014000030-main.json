CPAs were employed individually or in binary, tertiary or quaternary solutions. In some experiments apexes were treated successively with two CPA solutions with increasing total concentration. P. damicornis apexes withstood exposure for up to 30 min to solutions containing 0.6-0.8 M sucrose (Suc) or trehalose (Tre). When apexes were treated with binary cryoprotectant solutions containing Suc and ethylene glycol (EG), methanol (Meth), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me 2 SO) or glycerol (Gly), the CPAs employed in combination with Suc could be ranked in the following order of decreasing tolerance: EG > Meth > Me 2 SO > Gly. P. damicornis apexes tolerated exposure to complex CPA solutions containing Suc, Me 2 SO, EG and/or Meth with a total molarity of 2.45 M. In experiments where two successive CPA solutions were employed, apexes withstood treatment with the second, more concentrated solution at 0\u00b0C for up to 10 min. These preliminary results pave the way to the development of a cryopreservation protocol for P. damicornis apexes.",

Indeed, human activities such as pollution (pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, oils), ore mining, degradations, sampling, over-fishing, tourism and natural aggressions including storms, earthquakes, predation from the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) Acanthaster planci, global warming and ocean acidification have led to an important reduction of the world's coral cover [5, 9, 23] . This loss of coral abundance has also had a negative impact on vertebrate and invertebrate species restricted to coral ecosystems. Corals constitute food zones, refuges, reproduction areas and nurseries for numerous marine species [14, 25, 27] . For local human populations, coral reefs have a high socio-economic importance and they also provide a natural protection against insular erosion.",

However, some authors suggested using the vitrification technique for cryopreservation of sensitive species [15, 21] . This technique requires high concentrations of CPAs (up to 7 M) to induce the vitrification (formation of an amorphous glassy state) of intracellular solutes during cooling of explants. A vitrification procedure comprises the following successive steps. During the first step, termed loading treatment, partial cell dehydration is induced by exposing cells to a moderately concentrated CPA solution, the loading solution (LS). The application of a concentrated vitrification solution (VS) is the second step of the protocol. Exposure of explants to VSs leads to the removal of most or all intracellular crystallisable water. As a result, intracellular vitrification is achieved during rapid cooling of explants in liquid nitrogen (LN). After rapid rewarming, explants are partially rehydrated in an unloading solution (ULS), which contains an intermediate CPA concentration, before their transfer to standard culture conditions.",

Experiment 4 showed that P. damicornis apexes could be treated with a succession of two CPA solutions with progressively increased concentration. As was observed in Experiment 2, Meth was less tolerated by apexes compared to EG at high concentrations. This experiment also demonstrated that P. damicornis apexes withstood the thermal shock of exposure to S2-S6 at 0\u00b0C.",

EG could be applied for up to 20 min at 2 M concentration, resulting in low AD, while treatment with Meth at the same concentration resulted in an increase in zooxanthellae expulsion. For some marine invertebrates, EG, used alone or in combination with Suc or Tre, ensured good survival after cryopreservation [8, 10, 11, 21, 37] . Adams et al. [2] observed that sea urchin larvae tolerated treatment with EG at 1-2 M for 30 min but no survival was achieved after cryopreservation. By contrast, high toxicity to EG was noted with oocytes of the hard coral Echinopora sp. for concentrations between 0.25 and 2.0 M [46] . Using embryos of the sea urchin P. lividus, Paredes et al. [36] demonstrated that EG toxicity varied, depending on the addition of Tre in the CPA solution and on the embryo development stage. As regards Meth, Dong et al. [11] , Roux et al. [42] and Tsai et al. [46] indicated that it should be used at low concentration. Tervit et al. [44] did not get any post-cryopreservation survival of C. gigas oocytes after cryoprotective treatment with Meth. The use of 3 M Meth was toxic for P. damicornis zooxanthellae [20] .",

A similar ranking was observed with C. gigas [40] and H. midae embryos [42] . In case of Anthozoan Echinopora spp. oocytes Tsai et al. [46] noted the following order of decreasing tolerance: Meth > Me 2 SO > Propylene glycol (PG) > EG. Xue et al. [51] observed the higher toxicity of Gly compared to Me 2 SO, EG or Meth on C. farreri spermatozoa. In our experiments, at the same concentration, non-penetrating CPAs (Suc or Tre) were more toxic to P. damicornis apexes compared to penetrating ones (Me 2 SO, EG or Meth). Renard [40] demonstrated the lower tolerance of C. gigas embryos to Suc compared to penetrating CPAs. Xue et al. [51] noted that adding Suc to the CPA solution had no positive effect on viability of C. farreri spermatozoa. This study demonstrated that P. damicornis apexes could tolerate treatment with ternary or quaternary CPA solutions including sugar, Me 2 SO and alcohol(s). Meth was generally less toxic than EG and Me 2 SO was well tolerated when employed at low concentration. Several reports [4, 7, 36] indicated that mixtures of CPAs were generally more efficient than a single CPA employed at the same total molarity. Apexes could also tolerate exposure to two successive CPA solutions with progressively increased concentration. Such a step-wise treatment may allow reducing osmotic shock, as demonstrated with other marine invertebrates [2, 36, 44] and also allow reaching a higher final CPA concentration.",

Lastly, when investigating coral calcification using a 45 Ca solution, Tambutt\u00e9 et al. [43] highlighted the importance of rinsing apexes to expel the 45 Ca solution from the coelenteron and extracellular space. In a similar manner, in CPA toxicity experiments with coral apexes, extensive rinsing of treated explants should be performed, as insufficient rinsing may induce CPA retention in explants, thus allowing the extension of CPA action and leading to a toxic effect.",

These two qualitative variables (exposure time and concentration) had also a significant combined effect on AD (p < 0.05, Kruskal-test). AD increased significantly with the combination of variables, exposure times and concentration, for both disaccharides (p < 0.05, Kruskal-test), resulting in an increase in the quantity of expelled zooxanthellae and in the decrease of LA.LA and AD were not significantly different for exposure times of 15, 20 and 30 min and sugar concentrations of 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 M (p > 0.05, Fisher's Exact Test and p > 0.05, Kruskal-test, respectively). For exposure durations of 45 and 60 min to sugar concentrations of 0.6-0.8 M, Tre induced higher AD compared to Suc (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon-test). When sugars were employed at concentrations of 0.9 and 1.0 M, for exposure times of 15 and 20 min, Suc produced higher AD compared to Tre (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon-test).",

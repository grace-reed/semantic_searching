    "abstract": "High latitude seas will be among the first marine systems to be impacted by ocean acidification (OA). Previous research studying the effects of OA on the pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica, has led this species to be identified as a sentinel organism for OA in polar oceans. Here, we present gene expression data on L. h. antarctica, collected in situ during the seasonal transition from early spring to early summer. Our findings suggest that after over-wintering under seasonal sea ice, pteropods progress toward full maturity in the early summer when food becomes increasingly available. This progression is highlighted by a dramatic shift in gene expression that supports the development of cytoskeletal structures, membrane ion transportation, and metabolically important enzymes associated with glycolysis. In addition, we observed signs of defense of genomic integrity and maturation as evidenced by an up-regulation of genes involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, and gametogenesis. These data contribute to a broader understanding of the life-cycle dynamics for L. h. antarctica and provide key insights into the transcriptomic signals of pteropod maturation and growth during this key seasonal transition.",

The Southern Ocean is projected to follow the Arctic Ocean in timing as the second major ocean to experience rapid declines of carbonate mineral saturation states, particularly the more soluble calcium carbonate polymorph -aragonite (Fabry et al., 2009; Hauri et al., 2015; Kapsenberg et al., 2015; McNeil and Matear, 2008) . This change in ocean chemistry will have wide ranging impacts on calcifying marine organisms, and barring mechanisms of rapid adaptation or physiological plasticity, such global abiotic changes will likely impact the integrity of marine food webs. Thus, a major research challenge in polar marine ecosystems is to study the response of key species to these projected ocean changes.",

Here, shelled pteropods have been proposed as sentinel organisms for detecting the progression of OA (Manno et al., 2017; Maas et al., 2018; Moya et al., 2016) . In the Southern Ocean, the pteropod Limacina helicina antarctica has emerged as the focal sentinel species because it produces a highly soluble aragonite-based shell and is distributed across all sectors of the Southern Ocean. Unfortunately, due to its location in remote high latitude seas, a life history that involves long periods under fast sea ice, and its relatively small size, it remains a challenge to observe these organisms in situ. The focus of this study was to use comparative transcriptomics as a means to further our understanding of a sentinel species. Here, signatures of gene expression provide insight into the physiological status of L. h. antarctica collected below the seasonal sea ice.",

Ecologically, L. h. antarctica plays a major role in food web dynamics and energy transfer, both as prey and as a primary consumer (Hunt et al., 2008; Lancraft et al., 1991) . Here, L. h. antarctica is prey for a variety of organisms including carnivorous zooplankton and fish (Hunt et al., 2008; Lancraft et al., 1991) , which in turn support higher trophic levels (Davis et al., 1999; McClintock et al., 2008; Seibel and Dierssen, 2003) . As a primary https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.10.006 Received 7 June 2018; Received in revised form 11 October 2018; Accepted 12 October 2018 consumer, Elliott et al. (2009) estimated that L. h. antarctica could remove up to 550 mg C m \u22123 of the haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica per day during the summer when P. antarctica blooms. In terms of biogeochemical cycling, L. h. antarctica produces organic carbon in the form of fecal pellets and discarded mucous nets (Accornero et al., 2003; Manno et al., 2009) , and inorganic carbon in the form of calcium carbonate shells that sink to deeper waters following pteropod mortality (Honjo, 2004) . In some parts of the Southern Ocean, pteropod shells are a significant contribution of carbon in the system (Collier et al., 2000; Gardner et al., 2000) .",

In this study, we had the opportunity to collect young adult pteropods in the southern Ross Sea, a region of the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean, at a time when the pteropods were exiting an over-wintering period and entering the transition to austral summer. To capture aspects of developmental physiology in situ, we evaluated changes in the transcriptome of young adult L. h. antarctica that were collected during early spring (early September) and early summer (late November/early December) ( Fig. 1 ). Seasonal transitions at high latitudes are marked by conspicuous seasonal day/night cycles, in which there is 24 h of darkness during the winter and 24 h of sunlight during the summer, separated by brief transition periods during the spring and autumn. This day/night seasonality drives primary productivity in the region, with phytoplankton growth occurring in summer months (Smith et al., 2000) . This phenology of productivity in turn dominates the timing, rate, and quantity of energy flow throughout the Antarctic food web. Photosynthesis processes that are suppressed during the winter and dramatically increase during the summer months are a major driver of pH seasonality in the Ross Sea region (Kapsenberg et al., 2015) . Therefore, environmental changes including light, food availability, and seawater carbonate chemistry, are all factors than impact L. h. antarctica during this seasonal transition.",

L. h. antarctica is a protanderous hermaphroditic species primarily believed to have an annual life cycle with young adults overwintering before developing into mature males, transitioning to females, and spawning during the late summer or early autumn (Hunt et al., 2008) . Although there is evidence that this species can live up to three years or more, individuals greater than a year of age are thought to make up a relatively small portion of Antarctic pteropod populations (Bednar\u0161ek et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017) . In summer field campaigns, we have routinely collected pteropods in high numbers during plankton tows with all animals being of about the same size, suggesting these pteropods are all a single cohort of one age class .",

Other studies have used comparative transcriptomics to stage the timing of reproduction in macrozooplankton (Roncalli et al., 2018) . In our study, analysis of differential gene expression would contribute to the effort to use L. h. antarctica as a sentinel species in the Southern Ocean. Thus, to assess seasonal transcriptomes in L. h. antarctica, we performed RNA-sequencing on pteropods collected in September during early austral spring (i.e., the onset of the transition from 24-h darkness to 24-h daylight), and in November to December, during early summer (i.e., after the transition, during 24-h daylight). As such, these pteropods likely represent post-overwintering young adults possibly developing into mature adult males. For this sequencing effort, we used comparative transcriptomics to identify season-specific changes in the transcriptome and explored gene expression networks that correlate transcriptome-wide expression profiles to season. In general, our results highlighted a distinct difference between the early spring and early summer-collected pteropods. Overall, these shifts in the transcriptome likely reflect both the annual increase in food availability as well as physiological changes associated with their reproductive phenology.",

Overall expression differences between seasons were tested for significance using the Adonis function as implemented in the R vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2013) .

Gene expression between tows was also assessed using a discriminant analysis of principle components (DAPC) as implemented in the R package adegenet (v2.1.1). For this analysis the DAPC function was first called by grouping samples by tow and retaining all principle components and discriminant functions. This output was subsequently inputted into the optim.a.score function with 1000 simulations in order to determine the optimum number of principle components to retain in the DAPC analysis. The final DAPC function was therefore called using the first 8 principle components and 1 discriminate function that represents 80.4% of all variance in the samples.",

Gene ontology enrichment analysis (Fisher's exact test, FDR < 0.05) and KEGG mapping were conducted using the program Blast2GO (version 4.0). Network expression analysis was also performed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008) with the normalized read-counts. Significant gene modules (p-value < 0.05) with correlations > 0.50 were used to measure gene ontology enrichment and KEGG mapping. Gene identifiers for each enriched set of gene ontologies were then used to compile heatmaps to visualize expression patterns across sampling days. Finally, longest open reading frames were transcribed to protein sequences for genes identified as being involved in spermatogenesis and analyzed using OrthoFinder (v.2.1.0) to identify one-to-one orthologues between L. h. antarctica and the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Emms and Kelly, 2015) .",

Discriminant analysis of the principle components between tows further reinforces the effect of season on gene expression ( Fig. 2b) with clear defined separation between seasons and not individual tows.

Enrichment analysis of the transcripts upregulated in the summer compared to the spring revealed 24 gene ontologies enriched in the summer (FDR < 0.05, S2). Reducing these ontologies to the most specific branch (FDR < 0.01) identified 9 specific gene ontologies (Table 2, Data S3). Among these ontologies the three dominant ontology terms that highlight physiological process that were identified as changing, were for processes associated with: (1) potassium ion transport, (2) GTPase activity, and (3) cytoskeleton structural components. Further, genes differentially expressed that were associated with these 3 dominant ontologies included multiple alphaand beta-tubulins, voltage-gated potassium channels, and a guanine nucleotide-binding G(i) alpha subunit. We used KEGG enzyme mapping to further explore the physiological pathways and processes changing among these up-regulated transcripts. This analysis identified genes coding for 5 enzymes associated with key components of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (Table 3, Data S4).

Enrichment analysis revealed 723 enriched gene ontologies (FDR < 0.05) that were reduced to 513 gene ontologies using a 0.01 FDR cut-off. Gene ontologies were further reduced such that higher ontologies were excluded if a nested related-ontology was still statistically significant (FDR < 0.01). These steps identified 108 specific gene ontologies that are important for maintaining DNA integrity, including protein phosphorylation, double strand break repair, damaged DNA binding, spermatogenesis, and the MCM complex (Table 4 , Data S5). Orthofinder identified 159 one-to-one orthologous sequences between all 2547 transcripts in this module and the 2482 genes associated with gametogenesis in the Pacific oyster (Data S7) (Dheilly et al., 2012) . KEGG enzyme mapping of this module revealed that 7 of these orthologous genes code for enzymes involved in the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, a pathway known to be expressed in connection with many cellular functions including spermatogenesis in Drosophila, crane flies, and mice (Table 5, Data S6) (Blume-Jensen et al., 2000; Fabian et al., 2010; Saul et al., 2004) . Overall, these analyses revealed that many critical components for DNA damage repair, DNA binding, the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, and genes potentially involved in gametogenesis/spermatogenesis were up-regulated in most of the spring samples (Fig. 5) .

The transcripts associated with this pattern were identified as superoxide dismutase, perlucin 1, inositol oxygenase, calmodulin, and 11 zinc-finger-like genes. Analysis of the distribution of these transcripts across the sampling period revealed variability across collection dates (Fig. 6 ).

                "text": "Focusing on specific genes of interest within the summer transcriptomic response of L. h. antarctica identified a large number of transcripts that displayed elevated expression in summer-collected pteropods. Within this group of transcripts were genes that presented a fingerprint of metabolic activation in the summer. Specifically the enrichment of cytoskeletal genes, genes that code for components of potassium ion channels, and key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway indicated that individuals collected during the summer were more metabolically active than those collected in the early spring. These results indicated a differential in metabolic activity in the animals collected during the different seasons -here, possibly a mild metabolic depression during the early spring as they exit winter, combined with a physiological activation of metabolic activity in the early summer. This speculation concerning metabolism is indirectly supported by field data Table 4 Enriched gene ontologies among transcripts associated with decreased expression in the summer relative to the spring. GO terms without significant association are listed as NA. (Daly et al., 2017) . In a previous study, the availability of food sources such as Phaeocystis antarctica has previously been associated with similar patterns of metabolic suppression in L. h. antarctica during episodes of limited phytoplankton biomass (Seibel and Dierssen, 2003) . Overall, these data indicate that the observed changes in gene expression may be linked to increasing food availability in the pelagic environment in the austral summer. In contrast, assessing the early spring transcriptomic response of L. h. antarctica revealed expression of genes associated with DNA repair, the regulation of meiosis and mitosis, and processes that may be connected with maturation. Specifically, we observed changes in transcripts that indicate pteropods exiting winter conditions were investing resources in maintaining genomic integrity. Here, for example, we identified genes in two important groups -(1) genes associated with the mini chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, and (2) genes coding for processes in the genome, here, sister chromatid cohesion, and chromatin binding. This suggests that overwintering young adult pteropods were investing resources in maintaining genomic integrity. The MCM complex is responsible for regulating chromosome replication during cell division (Lei and Tye, 2001) . In one study, the MCM complex displayed increased expression levels when transcription was coupled with increased levels of oxidative stress (Hubbi et al., 2011) ; another study noted that MCM expression may also provide increased protection from DNA replication stress (Bai et al., 2016) . The second group -the genes associated with sister chromatid and chromatin function -are also central to cell division as they directly control chromosome segregation during anaphase. Along with these two processes, we identified an enrichment of gene ontologies associated with DNA-templated replication, the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, and nucleosome assemblies, further supporting the hypothesis of active cellular proliferation during the early spring season. Together, this pattern of gene expression suggests that in the spring season, pteropods are investing in cellular division and the maintenance of cellular replication in the light-limited subzero pelagic environment. Food-limitation alone does not explain this expression pattern as the increased expression of these genes relative to the food-rich summer suggests this response is associated with abiotic conditions. One such factor that may be impacting these individuals as they overwinter is oxidative stress. Notably, other studies have raised the possibility that the high oxygen environment of polar seas may increase oxidative stress that directly impacts cellular processes such as DNA replication in polar marine invertebrates (Abele and Puntarulo, 2004) .",

The blue module also highlighted the increased expression of genes involved in metabolic processes, a finding that agrees with the KEGG pathway mapping, wherein 8 enzymes from the glycolytic pathway were shown to be upregulated in the summer (Fig S6) . This correlation between module blue and day length most likely reflects the transition to 24 h of sunlight in early summer that drives large phytoplankton blooms.

In addition, the majority of juvenile forms were not collected again until March (Massy, 1920) . These observations, along with known reproductive phenology in Limacina retroversa (Hsiao, 1939) , suggests that individuals in McMurdo Sound have a progression of life history events where young adult males begin to mature either during the winter or light-limited spring, transition to females during early summer, and are gravid during mid-summer from late December to February. Offspring hatch from free-floating egg masses in March, and then spend a majority of their first winter slowly developing under the seasonal sea ice.

In this study, we used WGCNA to compare gene expression patterns between spring-acclimatized and summer-acclimatized pteropods when admittedly we had limited environmental data from the Ross Sea to frame their past environmental exposures. This approach identified 5 gene networks that were significantly correlated with the carbonate chemistry in the early spring sampling time-points. The influence of season on gene expression was also observed in the principle coordinate analysis (Fig. 2C) wherein the carbonate chemistry variables were more associated with spring samples while day length was associated with summer samples. While there is an undeniable role of food availability that is driving the summer signal, the early spring signal may reflect the effects of the annual increase in pCO 2 below the winter sea ice.",

                "text": "In this study, we described changes in gene expression between collections of pteropods made in the early spring and early summer in McMurdo Sound in the southern Ross Sea. The general trend we observed was a global increase in gene expression in summer-collected pteropods with significant changes in genes involved in metabolic processes and cytoskeletal structure. In contrast, individuals collected during the spring season had increased expression of genes associated with DNA replication and DNA repair. By incorporating network analysis via WGCNA, we identified 3 large gene modules that were significantly different between season. Of these, module blue had the highest correlation with the summer season as is evident in the module heatmap that clearly clusters samples by season (Fig. 4) . This module was enriched for many core physiological and metabolic processes, in particular glycolysis. This observation is consistent with the expected increase in available food associated with the austral summer's 24 h of sunlight, providing for the proliferation of diatoms and dinoflagellates, the primary food source for L. h. antarctica (Hunt et al., 2008) . The other two modules (green and black) provide additional evidence that spring-collected pteropods are actively expressing genes involved in carbohyrate metabolism, cellular proliferation, and DNA repair. Together these three modules suggest that pteropods are actively developing across these seasonal transitions, with the spring transcriptome being characterized with genes associated with oxidative stress response suggesting that spring-collected pteropods under seasonal sea ice are investing energy reserves to cellular maintenance and maturation, and the increased food availability in summer provides the additional resources necessary for increasing expression of genes associated with cytoskeletal growth. Finally, the transcriptome profiles presented here provide a basis for understanding how additional stressors such as ocean acidification will affect this sentinel species in the Southern Ocean.",

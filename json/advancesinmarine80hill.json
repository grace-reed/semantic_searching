The plant body, or thallus, also possesses a holdfast which provides attachment to or in the substrate (Fig. 2 ).",

The plasma membrane has separated from part of the wall. Scale bar is 0-1 [xm. The outermost region of the filament wall contains one or more osmiophilic layers (Fig. 9 ) which sometimes separate from the rest of the wall. Their precise chemical nature as yet is unknown. Although this region may be equivalent to the \"cuticle\" of Hanic and Craigie (1969) , a word they employed with reservation, it seems more appropriate to use the earlier terminology of Brand (1901) and call it a \"covering lamella\" (Decklamella). This lacks the chemical connotation of cuticle, and clearly indicates the region of the filament wall involved.",

Further details of these epithets are listed in the species description for tuna hy Barton (1901) . The first and possibly only published recipe for Halimeda as food is another seventeenth-century contribution. Bauhin and Cherler ( 1 65 1 ) report that it makes a good dish when treated with vinegar, salt and oil. The earliest non-Mediterranean collections of Halimeda came from the West Indies, notably those obtained in about 1687 by the physician Hans Sloane, later Sir Hans Sloane, who stopped at Jamaica in the suite of the Duke of Albemarle. Sloane's visit was curtailed by the death of the Duke, but nonetheless he collected some 800 new plant and animal species during the 15 months of his stay (Sloane, 1707) . Among these was the second species of Halimeda to be discovered. In his volume dealing with the natural history of Jamaica, Sloane (1707) called this species Corallina opuntia. It is what is now known as Halimeda opuntia, the straggly cushion-shaped clusters of which are a prominent feature of shallow parts of Caribbean reefs. Sloane's specimen is contained in the Sloane Herbarium of the British Museum (Natural History).",

As such they appear in his treatise with Solander (Ellis and Solander, 1786) , published after the death of both Ellis and Solander under the direction of Ellis' daughter, Martha Watts. The use of binomial nomenclature in this work and in an earlier publication (Ellis, 1767) probably grew out of his extensive correspondence with Linnaeus and work with Solander, a favourite student of Linnaeus. Four of the species with their epithets are still accepted; the remaining one, tridens, has been placed in synonymy under incrassata (Section IV) . The species incrassata (tridens) and monile were new with Elhs, whereas opuntia had been described by Linnaeus in his \"Systema Naturae\" (1758), using the binomial Corallina opuntia.

Furthermore, ElHs worked with some of the best laboratory hardware of the day including an \"aquatic microscope\" (Fig. 13) made by a London optician and \"improved\" by Ellis specifically for examining living corallines. I used Ellis' aquatic microscope at the Science Museum (London) and found the resolution to be surprisingly good. Figure 14 shows a photomicrograph of the surface of Halimeda incrassata made with it. The more obvious surface features of the plant can be conceived almost as certainly as with a modern microscope. The smallness of the field, and its curv^ature, are the main problems of these simple instruments. Chromatic aberration led to some vexing difficulties, but not as much as in the compound microscopes of the time.",

Mr. Dollond has at my request fitted up a pocket microscope that pleases most people ; it consists of my aquatic & Wilsons combind together so as to be very little larger than the aquatic alone The Museum description states: \"This type of microscope may be regarded as the precursor of the most complete and perfect of our simple dissection microscopes, and it was made with slight modifications by all the leading opticians until the early years of the 19th century. . . . The round hollow pillar screws into a socket in the lid of the fish-skin case. The mirror mounted in gimbals is fitted to the pillar by a spring-pin and socket. The inner sliding rod which carries the objective arm can be fixed at the desired height by a clamping screw. The stage is removable for portability, and a Wilson screw barrel microscope with three additional powers is added, which can be adapted to the stand\". (Photograph British Crown Copyright.

The practice was continued into the nineteenth century with the work of naturalists such as Lamarck (1813) and Lamouroux (1812 and Lamouroux ( , 1816 , but the term \"zoophyte\" was replaced with the preferred \"polypier\". More significantly, Lamouroux subdivided the coralline group into a number of genera. One of these was Halimedea (1812) or Halimeda (1816), to which he transferred the five species delimited by Ellis. The generic name we now use had been born. Another name, Sertolaria, with Imperato's Sertolara as type specimen, actually had been proposed earlier by Boehmer (see Ludwig, 1760) , but the epithet Halimeda is the one that became established and in 1956 this familiar name was conserved (Lanjouw et al., 1956 ).

Not all of these species proved satisfactory, however. Until 1888, the taxonomy was based almost entirely on external characteristics, with emphasis on what is now recognized as an exceedingly variable character, \"segment shape\". The microscope was not used critically for identification and Kiitzing 's statement (1857), that internal organization was uniform among the species of Halimeda, provides some insight into the \"state of the science\" at that time. With such heavy reliance on segment shape, it is not surprising that certain taxa such as opuntia, and to a lesser extent incrassata, both of which commonly show a large variety of segment types, were at one time each described as more than one species. Segment shape, along with habit, also formed the basis of Agardh's (1887) sections within the genus which subsequently have been ignored (Hillis, 1959) , at least partly because of their unsatisfactory definition.",

Consequently those that she did not consider to be stunted or small specimens of the typical incrassata, she designated as a distinct form of incrassata, f. ovata.

However, most of those on which it has been feasible to work are micronesica, a species described in 1941 which will be discussed later on p. 32, and which is of especial interest because of the pattern of its nodal medullary filaments. A few are opuntia or simulans, the latter a taxon in which the pores of the fused nodal filaments are sometimes small and not readily noticeable (Hillis, 1959) . It, therefore, presents some of the gradations Barton indicated for this character in the above quotation. These identifications of the anomalous f. ovata material have clarified and to a certain extent strengthened the major portions of Barton's work. In retrospect. Barton's taxonomy was conservative, which was an approach much needed at the time. Its strengths lay in the discovery of essentially one microscopic characteristic of major taxonomic significance, in the fairly rigid application of it in identification, in the emphasis on examination of type specimens, and in the inclusion of material from other than the Siboga collection, which, although severely limited, did extend the work to all the tropical oceans. After the monograph was published. Barton continued identifying algae, published one paper on reproductive structures in Halimeda (Gepp, 1904) , and more on Siboga algae in the important joint publication, with her husband, about the Codiaceae (Gepp and Gepp, 1911) . The work after 1911 was not extensive, however; there appeared to be little further study of Halimeda, and one suspects that marriage in 1904 to Anthony Gepp, Curator of Botany at the British Museum (Natural History), and the contemporary attitude towards women and careers had their impact. For a brief time, however, the genus Halimeda was tidy.",

He renamed incrassata with the epithet tridens, which he believed had priority. Barton had chosen the epithet incrassata when merging older species, but Collins (1901) , whose \"Algae of Jamaica\" preceded Barton's monograph by a few months, had chosen tridens for a similar merger. Howe's decision depended on Collins having correctly identified the type description of incrassata and tridens as being that referred to in a single publication by Ellis and Solander (1786) . The first author to merge species erected in a single earlier paper has priority of choice for the name to be used (International Rules of Nomenclature). Collins chose tridens; Barton chose incrassata; Collins chose first. Borgesen (1911 Borgesen ( , 1913 put the merged species back to incrassata where Barton put it. This argument over naming the species has had the heritage that American and European workers gave the same species different names for much of this century. Americans followed Howe in using tridens and Europeans followed Borgesen and Barton in using incrassata. This confusion was only resolved with the monograph of Hillis (1959) . In this it was demonstrated that incrassata is the appropriate name because Ellis, in his 1767 publication, included excellent illustrations, with analyses, of a \"coralline\" to which he applied the specific epithet ''incrassata'' (Fig. 12 ). This meets the requirements for valid publication as stated in the Paris Code (Lanjouw et al., 1956, Article 43) . The original merger proposed by both Collins and Barton is still accepted, and the name of the species is Halimeda incrassata and not H. tridens. Borgesen's (1911 Borgesen's ( , 1913 interpretation of Caribbean material tended to parallel Howe's, yet refiected his own thinking. He considered that monile and simulans differed sufficiently from incrassata to be treated as separate taxa, but that they were only varieties of incrassata. These subspecies were considered of specific rank by Hillis (1959) , as originally suggested by Howe. In this way Hillis' monograph resolved both differences of usage between America and Europe : the correct name for Barton's H. incrassata, and the specific status of H. monile and H. simulans.",

A quiet outburst of Halimeda data had occurred, and, as a result, Barton's monograph could no longer be used exclusively to study the Halimedae of any one region. It remained a useful introduction to the critical taxonomy of Halimeda, but was not the definitive work on the genus. In the mid-1950s Hillis, later publishing as Colinvaux and Hillis-Colinvaux, began working on Halimeda. Studying at the University of Michigan she had available the university's herbarium containing extensive collections from several Caribbean Islands as well as from the Marshall Islands. Curators of the New York Botanical Garden and the British Museum (Natural History) lent considerable portions of their large Halimeda holdings, the former collection containing much of Howe's and some of Borgesen's material, the latter including important specimens examined by Barton, although the bulk of Siboga expedition material, housed in the Rijksherbarium, was examined several years later in Leiden. A loan from the University of California provided additional plants from Pacific reefs. The collections, supplemented with other important although smaller loans and some live material, provided about as extensive a world coverage as then existed, and formed a good basis for the investigation which led to a revision of Halimeda taxonomy (Hillis, 1959) , with the recognition of 21 species (Table I) .",

Summary: the evolution o/ Halimeda studies Halimeda was first known from the single species H. tuna that lives in the Mediterranean Sea, and this species continued to be the only one known for more than a century. The second, the familiar H. opuntia, was found by Sloane (1707) in Jamaica. Only 8 of the species now accepted were known by the turn of this century, and most of the 30 species now accepted are discoveries of the last three decades. Halimeda, like so many other genera, was too easily split into many species on the basis of superficial surface features during the nineteenth century. The taxonomist who brought order to the genus was Barton (1901) , and Fig. 15 . A single medullary filament occurs in the node of H. cryptica, and the wall is much thicker in this region than elsewhere. The collar of smallish utricles from the upper segment which would surround much of the exposed filament has been dissected away. Scale bar is 100 (xm. (From Colinvaux and Graham, 1964.) the genus received its second monographic treatment by Hillis (1959) .",

However, with the splitting of some of these species, and the discovery and description of others, such heavy reliance on a single microscopic character is not possible. And if the many new species have validity-there are now over four times the number Barton recognized (Table I) -it follows that reliable characters exist to separate them. For Halimeda many of these are known and tested, and as with most algae they are principally microscopic. However, I have found a few macroscopic characteristics to be reasonably dependable, and when they are combined with distributional data rehable field identification of some species is possible.

In some species the degree of calcification appears noticeablydifferent between deep and shallow forms (Hillis, 1959; Goreau, 1963;  Bohm, 1973a; Section IX), and species such as fragilis, gracilis, lacrimosa and hikinensis usually seem considerably more calcified than cuneata or lacunalis. Finally, the shape of basal segments may be noticeably different from the shape predominating in upper portions of the thallus. This is most marked in micronesica where the lowermost segment is usually several times larger than the other segments and very irregular in outline (Fig. 46 ). In members of the incrassata group several of the lowermost segments may remain unbranched, producing a caulescent effect, or adjacent basal segments may consolidate laterally forming a rather massive fan-shaped structure (Fig. 12 ).",

H. opuntia, festooning Acropora sp. on the reefs of the Similan Islands, eastern Indian Ocean. The spreading thallus is anchored at several places, and the older parts of the thallus (shown near the centre) die away and become sejaarated from the younger portions, producing a clone of several younger thalli. The multi-holdfast system is a useful growth strategy-for a clone that may be grazed. Long dimension of the clump in right-centre is approximately 7 cm. \"Rope-like extensions\" were described by Hillis (1959) for micronesica. Fine rhizoidal-type filaments extend from several apical segments and become intertwined into ropes which attach to the substrate. Halimeda micronesica plants may be held down bj^an orange-brown mat of these ropes which may be up to 6 cm or more in In several species the basal point of attachment is poorly developed and may be difficult to locate, particularly in dried material. Instead, where some of the branches touch the substrate fine rhizoidal filaments may develop, giving attachment. This pattern may occur together with a spreading type of growth where thallus branches along crevices, or over and around coral heads. Adventitious holdfasts occur in some plants oi opuntia (Fig. 19 ), distorta, gracilis and copiosa.",

From continued herbarium studies, combined with more extensive field work, I have found that separation along these lines not only seems valid on the basis of phylogenetic implications, but also that each of these patterns of nodal filaments is frequently accompanied by other similarities. This seems especially true of a number of habit characters, and is well illustrated by species with the incrassata type of fusion (Table III , filaments fuse into a single unit), all of which possess a large bulbous holdfast and grow erect, or essentially so, in an unconsolidated substrate. These groups appear to represent natural units within Halimeda which should be recognized formally.",

This name, therefore, is not used. Each of these three sections retains some of the species originally placed in it by Agardh. The two new categories, Micronesicae and Crypticae, have each been given the epithet (with appropriate ending) of the first species described with the pattern of nodal filaments characteristic of that For all five sections the only character truly diagnostic is the pattern of the filaments at the nodes. However, a few other characters, some of them macroscopic, seem to be associated, fairly reliably, with the nodal groups. These also are given in Table V. Finally, the original circumscription of the genus by Lamouroux (1812) described its construction as multiaxial (\"axe fibreux\"). This excludes the uniaxial species cryptica.

It included the genera Codium, Bryopsis, Botrydium and Vaucheria. Blackman and Tansley (1902) formally established the order Siphonales for this group of plants which by then included Halimeda. They subdivided their new order Siphonales into two suborders, the Siphonocladeae for septate thalli, and the Siphoneae for those that were non-septate, that is, coenocytic. Soon afterwards Oltmanns (1905) elevated the first group to order status (Table VI) , leaving only true coenocytes in the Siphonales.",

The culture studies of Kornmann (1938) provided some of the basic data, for Kornmann had observed the zoospores of Derhesia marina (Lyngbye) Sol., a small, branched filamentous alga, develop into plants identifiable as the sac-like Halicystis ovalis (Lyngbye) Aresch. And Feldmann (1950) , in the years subsequent to his 1946 paper on siphonalean taxonomy, had linked Derhesia tenuissima (De Not.) Crn. with Halicystis parvula Schmitz. In contrast, members of the Codiales were known for a life-cycle in which there was only one free-living phase (haplobiontic) which was diploid in these algae. As another difference between the two new orders special gametangia developed on the filaments of members of the Codiales, whereas specialized structures did not occur in the Derbesiales, the entire thallus of the gamete-bearing phase, Derhesia, functioning as a gametangium.",

This conclusion was also reached by Rietema (1975 In contrast, the life-history character Feldmann (1954) applied to the Caulerpales, holocarpy or the complete involvement of the thallus in the production of gametes and its death thereafter, has received some additional support. Feldmann could cite only two examples, Halimeda and Caulerpa, where such a pattern had been observed. Holocarpy has now been reported for Chlorodesmis (Ducker, 1965) , Penicillus (Hillis- Meinesz, 1975) and Udotea (Nizamuddin, 1963) . The one apparent modification is that holocarpy may involve only a portion of the thallus. In my laboratory aquaria I have occasionally observed Halimeda to produce the conspicuous grape -like clusters of gametangia on only one to two branches of the thallus, or a relatively small portion of the entire plant. Subsequently, it was only this part of the plant that died.",

It also occurs in Penicillus, and in Dichotomosiphon, the only member of the Dichotomosiphonales of Feldmann's classification (Frei and Preston, 1964) , as well as in algae that would not be assigned to either the Caulerpales or Dichotomosiphonales, such as Bryopsis sp. (Miwa et al, 1961; Frei and Preston, 1964; Maeda et al., 1966) . The complexity of wall chemistry and the difficulties of applying it broadly in the siphonaceous algae have recently been illustrated by the identification of different wall polysaccharides as predominating in alternating stages of the life-cycle of some taxa (Huizing and Rietema, 1975) . Their evidence showed a mannan (probably p-l,4-mannan) as the principal filament-wall polysaccharide of the sporophytic stages of Bryopsis plumosa (Huds.) C.

These are : the appearance of the plant as a whole, of the holdfast system, and the of majority of the segments. Finer determination of species, or of species groups, in the field is helped by a knowledge of their geographic range. Microscopic taxonomic characters which are most used are : pattern of medullary filaments at the node (Table III) , size and appearance of the different series of utricles (Figs 17, 20) , and pattern and extent of cortex (Fig. 20) . All these characters vary somewhat with age and the position of the segment on the thallus. The specialized reproductive structures, the grape-like clusters of gametangia, do not occur on most material, and have not proved particularly useful in taxonomic work.",

A number of well-defined distinctions exist for bikinensis, however, including the greater degree of calcification of its segments, the dichotomous nature of the inner cortex, the smaller surface diameters of the peripheral utricles, and the relative ease of separation of these utricles.

From bikinensis, a taxon of relatively compact specimens with large segments, to 16 mm long and 25 mm broad, gracilis is often readily distinguished by its loose straggling habit which reaches a length of 1 m or more, and by its smaller segments, to 9 mm long and 15 mm broad. In contrast, plants of lacrimosa reach about 5 cm in length and are composed of spherical or tear-shaped segments rather than flat ones.",

Less striking but equally characteristic of cryptica is the especial delicacy of the nodes, an expression of this species' uniaxial construction (Figs 3, 15 ). All other described Halimedae are multiaxial (Hillis, 1959 ).

In contrast, the peripheral utricles of the lighted sm^face and of the edge of the segment continuing slightly into the umbral surface are well developed, and retain their shape on decalcification as do those of other Halimeda species.

This suggested that HaHmedae could be grown in aquaria, if necessary, far from the sea. This has been done (Colinvaux et al., 1965) , and Halimedae have been maintained at inland laboratories for over two years, in both natural and artificial seawater. with the production of more than one vegetative generation. Only the completion of the sexual cycle, with the development of the characteristic segmented thallus from the loose filaments obtained by the germination of zygotes (Meinesz, 1972b) , still remains to be carried out in culture.",

It is only with tuna from the Mediterranean that development beyond the zygote has been obtained (Meinesz, 1972b) , and this has not been the adult plant as we know it (Section VII). It is necessary, therefore, to begin cultures with direct transplants from the sea, a procedure that unavoidably introduces troublesome contaminants into the cultures. The basic procedure is to collect good field material, to clean it by hand, to plant it in simple aquaria, to bubble air into the water, to provide light and to combat epiphjrtes.",

They can be successfully transplanted into fresh aquaria. Another potential source of clean thalli are mdividuals produced by regeneration. The basic procedure is to remove branches of several segments from robust thalli by cutting at the node (where there are fewer filaments), briefly pressing the cut ends together to induce wall formation (Jacobs, 1958) , thereby preventing excessive loss of cytoplasmic materials, and then anchoring or planting the cuttings in substrate. I have had limited success with such cuttings which have ranged from two to a dozen segments. The longer cuttings were the most successful, and although none grew into a large thallus (all tended to get overgrown with epiphytes), a few produced new plants from rhizoidal runners in the sand (Section VII), and others produced rhizoids and segments. 9.

These workers did not seriously include blue-green algae in their study, so Cyanophyta may have occurred as well. It may be that massive imposition of epiphytes is a hazard to which Halimeda populations are adapted, and that their reproductive and persistence strategies will be influenced by this recurrent event. It is also possible that patterns of grazing on the Halimeda beds may be reflected in blooms of epiphytes. That the phenomenon occurs in nature suggests that it is an ecosystem event of some significance. It is also one such event that we can study in our cultures.",

However, the other Elysia, a lone specimen, appeared to feed mostly on one individual Halimeda although there were others of the same species in the aquarium.

Our information on growth is at the thallus, filament and ultrastructural levels. The classical accounts of growth are basically three. Askenasy (1888) provided the first short description when he noted that after a \"rest period\" the nodal filaments of an apical segment produced filamentous extensions which branched many times. The branches in turn branched and rebranched to the tips or peripheral utricles, which adhered, forming an outer surface and, as a result a new segment. Barton's (1901) account of the development of a new segment varied from that of Askenasy only in the branching pattern of the medullary filaments. The initial branching was trichotomous, with the middle branch continuing as part of the medulla while the two side branches divided and redivided until they terminated in the peripheral utricles.",

These are the extensions of the medullary filaments which branch and ramify as they grow. The branches develop into the cortical series of utricles of which the outermost ones are contiguous. Within about 24 hours, the albino protrusions from an apical segment develop a fairly complete, somewhat greenish segment. The outer surface, however, is spongy and disconnected, for the peripheral utricles have not yet formed a continuous outer surface. This separateness of the peripheral utricles is unlike the pattern encountered in mature segments of most species (Sections III, IV). The very young filaments of a segment, therefore, may have a different environment before and after being enclosed within the segment since at the earliest stages of growth they are in direct contact with seawater. The resulting closed or almost enclosed spaces may be important in calcification (Colinvaux et al., 1965; Wilbur et al., 1969; Bohm and ; Borowitzka and Larkum, 1976a, b, c, 1977; Borowitzka, 1977) .

They cultured Caulerpa on supplemented seawater at 24 + 1\u00b0C at 100 ft-c on a 12-hour light : 12-hour dark cycle, and found that rhizomes, rhizoid clusters and \"leaves\" elongated at the rate of approximately 4-4 mm d~\u00f4 r 3-1 cm wk-^. It seems likely that the incrassatae of the reef, when actively growing, may have a growth rate which is at least comparable to the best of those reported, that is, to 6 cm wk~^. Merten (1971) , in Guam, worked with 200 plants of macroloba in both field and laboratory environments. The average growth rates for her four populations followed the same pattern, and all four were of the same general order of magnitude. For the 200 plants she gives an average growth rate of 5-8 cm for the first month, and 1-5-3-0 cm for the other months, with the laboratory populations performing as well or slightly better than the three field populations in overall height, although the plants were less branched and the segments irregular. The higher rate obtained is of the same order of magnitude as the opportunistic growth measure of Finckh (1904) on an unknown species of Halimeda.",

The first losses of segments are generally restricted to the apical portion of the thallus, and vigorous new branches generally develop to replace fallen ones (Figs 52, 53 ). Occasionally there has been a massive whitening in a laboratory aquarium, with the segments of the upper third or half of the thalli of an aquarium population falling off a week or so after transplanting. New branches routinely develop at these sites.",

The younger and more vigorous segments and branches above them have mitiated rhizoidal development and attachment and continue as separate plants when the older segments fall away. This pattern of growth thereby also functions as a method of vegetative reproduction. In some species or environments, thalli being buried in shifting sand behave similarly.

Some Atlantic populations of tuna appear to fall into this category. The Mediterranean tuna Feldmann considered a phanerophyte, that is, an alga in which the entire thallus functions as the perennatmg structure, and very young Halimeda thalli of many species after their initial bout of growth would also fit this category. What any system of classifying life-forms is bound to do is to recognize common adaptations to common environmental constraints. But these systems can easily mislead. Raunkiaer (1934) , for instance, remarks on an absence of phanerophytes (essentially trees) from the tundra. This absence of trees in the Arctic may be accounted for by arguments based on heat balance, desiccation or maintenance of biomass, yet Raunkiaer's classification must have convinced many students that the critical difficulty is exposing buds to cold air, a proposition for which there is no evidence. In the same way there seems to be no reason for suggesting that the environmental range of a species of Halimeda is directly responsible for imposing a particular system of perennation. The showing in at least two of Feldmann's perennating taxa of a single species of Halimeda is evidence that this approach is of limited use.",

In cylindracea the osmiophilic covering lamella bulges outwards, away from the rest of the filament wall, and appears to fuse with the covering lamella of the neighbouring peripheral utricle (Borowitzka and Larkum, 1977) . The resulting space between covering lamella and filament wall contains a granular material. This is the only species for which lateral adhesion has been studied and reported at the ultrastructural level. The process is probably similar in most other species, but interesting variations may occur. In some species, particularly macrophysa (Sections III, IV), the peripheral utricles are free in mature segments. What happens in the developing segment has not been investigated. In other species where peripheral utricles barely touch each other {gracilis, Section IV) the covering lamella would provide the matrix to hold the utricles together and also provide the continuous outer covering of the segment.",

It was known, however, that plants were occasionally collected bearing tiny globules clustered on stalks along the margins of the segments or over their surfaces (Figs 61, 62 ). The clusters looked like miniature bunches of greenish to blackish grapes, and were sometimes sparse and restricted to one or a few segments ; at other times they were dense and covered much of the thallus. The general form of these structures in a number of species had been Fig. 61a. Figures 61a, b and described by several workers, some of them having only preserved or dried material to work with, and the review of reproduction for the genus (Hillis, 1959) indicated that plants bearing these clusters were rarely collected and were known for only nine species.",

This work shows that individual Halimeda thalli have a definite term to their existence, and that new thalli are cloned from creeping rhizoids of the parent thallus, or from broken portions partially buried by chance. There is no difficulty in recognizing generations in Halimeda (Fig. 63) , whether these be sexual or asexual, and the life-cycle always seems to involve youth, a maturity measured in months, sometimes longer, senescence and death.

His material was the large-segmented Mediterranean tuna, and he noted that mature gametangia were of two different colours, brown and green, which occurred on different thalli. The gametes released by the two were different also. Those from the brown gametangia were slightly larger (macrogametes), and usually contamed three small chloroplasts and a posterior eyespot. Those from the green gametangia (microgametes) possessed the same number of chloroplasts but lacked an eyespot. He noted, too, that when the gametangia were first formed almost all the contents of the coenocytic filaments of the segment, especially the chloroplasts and amyloplasts, moved into the gametangia. The filaments of the segment, therefore, were essentially empty, and the thallus, as a result, appeared white. These observations show that the sexual process involves : (i) growth of gametangia on stalks or gametophores ( Fig 64) ; (ii) the transfer of the free organic matter of the thallus, includhig reserves, to the gametangia (holocarpy), a process that turns the parent thallus white ;",

After the gametes had discharged and fused, the glass slides were placed in Petri dishes containing von Stosch's artificial seawater prepared with filtered water. The Petri dishes were exposed to different conditions of temperature and light, but the most successful were those maintained at 20-23\u00b0C in indirect sunlight. The seawater was changed every 15 days, and the glass slides were moved to another container if other algae or bacteria developed. When, after one year the resultant growth was 0-5-1 cm tall, the glass slides were placed in a closedsystem seawater aquarium equipped with bubbler and filter (Meinesz, 1973) . f\u00ea \u00f4 o \u00a3 Meinesz (1972b Meinesz ( , 1973 reported that after one week of growth under these conditions, the zygotes had a diameter of 5 pim, and contained a single nucleus and four to five chloroplasts. In seven months they developed into spheres of 100-150 [i,m diameter containing a single large nucleus of 7-10 [j,m diameter and over 500 lenticular chloroplasts with one or two large grains of starch. Amyloplasts were absent. This stage he called a \"protosphere\", the term protonema being inappropriate.",

It may be that a mature thallus can grow directly from one or more of the filaments of the mat. On the other hand, new structures might develop which could be precursal to the Halimeda structures with which we are familiar. Various workers have suggested that some of the more filamentous Caulerpales, such as species of Chlorodesmis and Pseudochhrodesmis, may be part of the cycle of genera such as Halimeda (Taylor et al., 1953; Papenfuss, 1962; Ducker, 1965; Meinesz, 1972b ).",

The ixiature Halimeda thallus has not yet been obtained from zygotes in culture. (Adapted from Meinesz, 1972b Meinesz, , 1973 B. Vegetative reproduction of Halimeda Halimeda plants that grow in sand reproduce by \"runners\" of filaments (Fig. 69 ). These filaments, or bundles of filaments, are at least 20 cm long (the limits of my aquaria) and spread laterally through the substrate from the main holdfast (Colinvaux et al., 1965; Colinvaux, 1968a, b; Hillis-Colinvaux, 1972 . They are non-photosynthetic, and are individually fine and threadlike. The walls of the filaments are relatively thick, and in places pigmented yellow and regularly constricted, so that the thread sometimes appears like a string of beads, particularly in the immediate vicinity of the plant. Eventually they produce a tight clump or cone-like mass of filamentous material (Fig.  70 ) which pushes up out of the substrate and from which the Halimeda segment is organized (Section VI). More segments are produced, sometimes at the rate of at least one a day per growing tip (Colinvaux et al., 1965) . Eventually the physical connections between young and parent thallus are lost.",

Individuals of a parental strawberry or coral clone will already have been selected during a series of competitive exclusions with neighbouring clones, and continued success requires that the winning formula be repeated. A sexual effort in such clones should only follow when the very high cost of producing many disastrously unsuitable experiments becomes less than the cost of making more copies of the parent. This cost of a sexual endeavour may well only be met when the cost of more vegetative reproduction is local extinction.",

In a like manner, sex will also precede episodes of dispersion, since the propagules must colonize habitats which will certainly be unlike that familiar to the parent clone. Finally, sex may well be the reproductive resort of individuals in the middle of the parent clone, even when the habitat remains unperturbed. These individuals will gain no advantage in fitness by producing copies of themselves since their surroundings are already full of their own copies. For these crowded ones in the middle of the clone the best hope of fitness will be to send out colonizing propagules (made various by sex), or to flood the old clonal habitat with new experimental genotypes, one of which just might be better than the parental strain.",

In 11 tanks a single thallus became fertile and released gametes between 12 August and 6 November. In none of these 1 1 tanks did another plant become fertile, although all were bathed in an opaque green cloud of gametes for a number of hours. In five tanks more than one thallus developed gametangia and gametes, but individual plants waited up to a month after their neighbour's sexual episode before they too developed gametangia. These data suggest rather strongly that Halimeda thalli do not take sexual cues from one another. In addition, in 20 years of field work in three oceans, I have never seen any incidence of gametangia that would suggest that a synchronous reproductive effort was being made.

Warm waters, however, are only approximately delimited by a fixed number of degrees of latitude, since their extent is determined by ocean currents, which in turn are aff\"ected by the rotation and orbiting of the earth and the topography of intervening land masses. The tropical band of sea is asymmetric. It is broad on the western side of the oceans, thin on the eastern side, a pattern which is most marked for the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Changes since the earlier revision of the genus (Hillis, 1959) include the addition of new species and the extension of known distributions, both of which are likely to occur in the future as well. It is particularly likely that some of the species now known only for the Pacific may be found in the Indian Ocean, where even less collecting has been done than in other oceans. It would also be interesting to know if species restricted to the Indian Ocean exist. Further collecting will also be needed to determine the true extent of endemism within the genus, for it seems likely that the known ranges of some very \"local\" species like cryptica, favulosa, gigas, goreauii, lacrimosa, melanesica, scahra and velasquezii will be extended. Table XIX also shows that of the four regions with more than ten Halimeda species, the greatest number is found in the Pacific, the least in the Atlantic. This pattern is exhibited by other tropical organisms, and may be a function both of area and of palaeohistory. This table also indicates that more species occur in the western portions of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. One might be tempted to conclude that the Marshall Islands, Jamaica and the Bahamas, with their peak numbers of Halimeda species for the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans respectively, represent centres of speciation or, alternatively, that larger areas or islands support more species of Halimeda. These conclusions, however, are premature, for these and other high numbers mostly represent regions of relatively intense collection and study. As many or possibly more species of Halimeda may eventually be known for other sites when their floras are adequately sampled and studied. The species list from Honduras, for example, has increased from six to nine as a result of relatively recent scuba collections. In reality, it may be longer, and some increase in numbers of species for neighbouring Central American countries is also likely, although the eventual total from these areas may never be as high. In the south-western Pacific, New Caledonia and other island groups probably have a more diverse Halimeda flora than is now recorded.",

Other Halimeda relatives such as Batophora and Acetahularia frequently appear in culture tanks, even though pains have been taken to clean sand, water and cultivars. But no Halimeda has appeared which cannot be shown to be a vegetative outgrowth of another plant. The Halimeda reliance on vegetative cloning is an excellent tactic for spreading from a place of establishment, but it is not accompanied by an effective mechanism for making the first invasion.",

The faunas for the Caribbean and Mediterranean regions of the time appear to have much in common (Valentine, 1973 ; Berggren and Hollister, 1974a; Hallam, 1975) , which is possibly the outcome of a current system common to much of the palaeoequatorial region, and to the low variability of climate. Perhaps the Halimeda fiora also was fairly similar for much of the region. Morellet, 1922, 1941; Elliott, 1960) . One species of Boueina also occurred.

They include the closing of the eastern end, then the western end of the Tethys Sea during the first half of the Cenozoic. The effect was to isolate the Tethys from the marine biota of both east and west. These events were followed by extreme evaporation in the region, with a sea-level drop of several thousand feet in the western Tethys during the Miocene (Berggren and Hollister, 1974a, b; Hsii et al., 1977) . This Messinian crisis was accompanied by massive extinction of marine life. It seems likely that the Halimeda flora did not survive, or at most existed in a relict flora to the immediate west. Following this mass extinction of the Tethyan flora, the present Halimeda of the Mediterranean must have been the result of a recolonization event, probably from the Atlantic Ocean. This would be a plausible event following the Messinian crisis because there was then a more northerly extension of warm water in the Atlantic Ocean than now (Berggren and Hollister, 1974a, b) .

If recruitment is not only difficult and slow, but is actually confined to brief geologic periods, when current patterns are favourable, then the slow -recruitment model is amplified. It is argued above that the Mediterranean may have collected its ancestral tuna population during a brief favourable period after the Messinian crisis.

Rates of speciation within the genus Once evolved, Halimeda relatively quickly seems to have replaced Arahicodium and Bouenia which are not known after the Cretaceous (Elliott, 1965 ). Elliott suggests, too, that the genus diversified rather rapidly during its early history into a number of species, some fossil, such as H. nana (Pia, 1932 ), H. praeopuntia (Morellet and Morellet, 1922) , H. praemonilis and H. eocaenica (Morellet and Morellet, 1941) , and some modern. There was also an increase in the size of segments and possibly in the size of the entire thallus. Three of the species, praeopuntia, eocaenica and praemonilis, are described by their authors as resembling the modern species opuntia, opuntia f. minor { = goreauii) and incrassata f. monilis { = monile) respectively (Morellet and Morellet, 1941) , with similarities such that Morellet and Morellet questioned the assignment of separate names to them. For the remaining taxa, H. nana and the undescribed species, the literature data are too sparse to associate them definitely with Recent species. Even so, two of the five types of nodal filament pattern delimited in Section III, those present in the Opuntia and Rhipsalis sections, and representing the sprawling and sand-binding habitats respectively, are represented in the species praeopuntia, eocaenica and praemonilis. It seems likely that one or more tunoid species (section Halimeda) also had differentiated before the Messinian crisis. If so, then three of the five types of nodal filament structure would have existed. These would correspond to the only patterns of nodal filaments present in modern species of pantropical distribution (Table XIX) , plants which also represent the major habitat types of sprawling, sand-binding and rock-growing. And interestingly, only pantropical species are present in modern reef communities of the Hawaiian Islands, the American shores and nearby islands of the eastern Pacific (with the exception of Easter Island), the Mediterranean, the Canary and Cape Verde Islands and Brazil (Table XIX, bottom line), while three of the four species growing in the Bermudan Islands are pantropical also.",

Some of these changes would have led to extinction, others to isolation sometimes followed by speciation. With the development of various barriers such as the Isthmus of Panama, or the land mass at the eastern end of Tethys, separate Indo-Pacific, western Pacific and Atlantic groups would have been created out of the pantropical stock. Subsequent speciation within them would lead to the development of taxa unique to these particular regions. Figure 76 illustrates possible lineages among Recent Halimeda species, and the directions in which development from pantropical stock may have occurred in different ocean regions as suggested by known distribution and similarities of habit and morphology. Some pantropical species, particularly tuna and incrassata, occur infrequently in many of the collections from the Pacific Ocean, and it is possible that satellite species such as lacunalis, macrophysa, macroloha or borneensis may be successfully replacing them. An alternative explanation is that their low numbers may be an artifact of the collections available.",

Some modern species, however, may have existed earlier than hitherto implied. The reason for questioning the time-scale lies in the present disjunct distribution of H. cuneata. One explanation for its modern occurrence in the southern subtropical regions, delimited by the south-eastern tip of South Africa, southern tip of Madagascar, south-western and south-eastern coasts of Au&tralia, and in the northern subtropical region of the Gulf of Cutch in north-west India (Fig. 75) is that this species had evolved at least by the time the regions represented were located in the same latitude, that is, before India had joined with continental Asia. The latest that they were in close proximity was in the Late Cretaceous (Smith and Briden, 1977) . li cuneata existed then, it seems likely that other modern pantropical species had also evolved, and therefore would have coexisted with the fossil species which, as already indicated, have been described for a later epoch. An alternative explanation is that cuneata formerly occurred along much of the east coast of Africa and the western shores of India, that it eventually extended into subtropical waters and was displaced, or essentially so, from tropical regions. This line of reasoning does not require such an early differentiation of the taxon. Information from fossils may provide the decisive support for one of these hypotheses.",

The record of thenown high productivity is preserved in many a coral reef, as in those at Funafuti where a significant part of the reef structure was found to be made of Halimeda segments (Section II). Understanding the productive capabilities of Halimedae, therefore, is necessary both for studies of energy flux through tropical reef communities, and for studies of the building of reefs themselves.",

                "text": "Answers to both these questions are essential to an understanding of productivity of the whole reef and energy flow in the reef system, as well as to reef modelling. Some appreciation of the first question, how the high productivity is achieved, is provided by the realization that nitrogen and possibly phosphorus are recycled within the system (Johannes et al., 1972) , the presence of some such pattern being expressed earlier in the review of coral reefs by Yonge (1963) . The 1972 report is part of the recent work of the SYMBIOS team that studied essentially the same part of the Enewetak reef as did the Odums, as well as a more northerly transect. Some details of the results of this team effort are still being published, but what is available adds strongly to the evidence that atolls may be nearly closed systems. They fix their own energy and cycle their own nutrients, are fertile islands in an infertile sea. In this respect coral atolls have to the ecologist something of the impact of lowland tropical rain forest, because this too supports itself on nutrient-poor substrate through very efficient nutrient retrieval systems. Eor the rain forests we have a faMy clear idea how nutrient retrieval and cycling work, but we know much less about the parallel systems in a coral atoll. It seems not unreasonable to expect that nutrient retrieval and cycling is sponsored by the primary producers, suggesting that the productivity of the various plant components of the reef ecosystem is a necessary subject for research. Figures 79 and 80 are photographs of the section of the Enewetak reef studied by the Odums and the SYMBIOS group. This section was Fig. 79 . The inter-island study site of Odum and Odum (1955) is 0-4 km north (right) of this islet, Japtan, on Enewetak Atoll, and north of the ship hulk, a relict of the Second World War. The Odum ti-ansect extended from the algal ridge, where the waves are breaking, towards the lagoon for approximately 300 m. The reef in this region is approximately 455 m wide. (Data from Odum and Odum, 1955.) chosen for its suitability to the flow-respiratory method of productivity measurement and does not include all parts of the atoll system. In particular, it does not include most of the macrophytes. Plants included in the transect were principally the algae of mats together with the symbiotic and boring algae associated with the corals, as well as some encrusting algae. In a careful search of much of this section of reef in 1975 I was unable to find a single Halimeda plant. This observation is perhaps brought into perspective by noting that borings from Enewetak show that Halimeda segments are a principal ingredient of the Enewetak reef matrix, just as they are at Funafuti (Couch et al., 1975 ). Fig. 80 . Two of six zones of the Japtan transect described by Odum and Odum (1955) in their inter-island transect: the encrusting zone (top), and zone of smaller coral heads (bottom). Halimedae were not found in either zone during our December 1975 visit. Breaking waves show at the top of these underwater pictures. Depth is c. 1'5 m.",

Their use has led to numerous papers on primary productivity, and the topic may appear at times to be well worked. For macrophytes, however, this is deceptive. These two techniques were developed for phytoplankton, and are hard to apply directly to macrophytes, although Drew and Larkum (1968) chose^*C methodology for Udotea in the field, and Borowitzka and Larkum (1977) used it in a laboratory measure of photosynthesis with detached branches of Halimeda. The coenocytic nature of the algae involved could present special problems which are not discussed in these papers. The technique of flow-respirometry, which is also used, as mentioned earlier, generally provides a measure of community rather than population productivity, and is restricted to regions where there is significant water flow in one direction for a meaningful length of time.",

By this procedure maximum productivities of 4-lgCm\"~2d~^(gross) and 2-3 g C m^^d~^(net) are attained.

Glory Be is the name given to a short section of the Jamaican fringing reef occupying a well-defined bay separated by headlands (Hillis-Colinvaux, 1972 ). The reef is described in Section X.A and illustrated in Figs 89-96 . Percentage cover of Halimeda, by species, was estimated for each section of the reef from the shoreline to the region of the Acropora palmata corals and the buttresses. By using the cover data ( Table XXI) and assuming that all species of Halimeda produce equally well regardless of depth or microhabitat, we can compute the contributions of the Halimeda populations to the total carbon flux of the reef.

The species macrophysa is a good example, opuntia somewhat less so. Most commonly, however, the segments floor some surface in the immediate vicinity, from whence they may be transported by the currents to other sites, or they may be transported directly. The pattern of movement will depend both on their weight (branches may be involved initially as well as segments) and on the strength of the currents. Their transport out of the region may be slowed by the growth of blue-green algal mats over them (Figs 102, 103 ), or by various gelatinous materials within the sediments (Moore et al., 1976 At Enewetak (Fig. 83) some of the lagoonal sediments may have originated on the fore -reef, and some lagoonally derived Halimeda material may be transported through the passes in the reef to outer areas. Such movements may be somewhat seasonally controlled, since li. HILLIS-COLnsrVAUX both the amounts of Halimeda segments shed and the types of currents may have seasonal components. At the Enewetak sites I visited, the commonest species were Tnacrophysa, opuntia, cylindracea, gigas, distorta, copiosa and lacunalis f. lata. These, then, are the species, about half the total number found on the atoll reef, which would contribute most of the Halimeda sediments (Hillis-Colinvaux, 1977) , but it is likely that two or three from this short list produce the bulk of the Enewetak sediments.

The overall linear relationship between the two functions is somewhat different in the two divisions of algae, as shown by the slopes of the regression lines. The curves were fitted by the least squares method. As the carbon accretion is related to tissue growth and the calcium accretion to skeletal growth, the slopes of the lines indicate that tissue growth rates in the Chlorophyta are proportional to the 0-3 power of the skeletal growth rate, whereas in the Rhodophyta the tissue growth rate is proportional to the 0-5 power of skeletogenesis. (From Goreau, 1963.) It is probably unwise to attempt to convert Goreau's figures into carbonate productivities per segment, thallus or unit area. The nitrogen basis of the measurements is excellent for comparing rates of uptake at the apex in vigorously growing specimens over short time intervals, but it does not follow that estimates of nitrogen in whole plants will let these data yield carbonate fluxes from senile plants. It is noted in Table XXX that segments are at their heaviest at senescence. Calcium uptake may not be a linear function of segment age.",

Dried and cleaned young field specimens which I collected in Jamaica provided most of the material, but the fertile incrassata and the last two incrassata samples listed of \"about to fall\" and \"fallen\" segments were collected in a laboratory environment though much of the calcification occurred in the reefs of Jamaica. Although no uncalcified oneto two-day-old segments were included in the study, or any old white sub-basal and basal segments, the data show some of the range encountered within a species, as provided by segments of different ages and with different rates of metabolism. The variation among species, if the subtropical cuneata is excluded, is not as great, and might be even less if younger and older incrassata were better represented in the samples. These data show, with the possible exception of cuneata, that the carbonate content of a segment is a function of segment age, which is a reasonable conclusion. Older segments generally have more carbonate than young segments, and this is particularly true of the final death and loss of segment stages, as is shown clearly in the data for incrassata, where the segments with most carbonate were those collected after death (the very heavy basal segments are specialized structures not typical of the segment flux). In interpreting the data for cuneata two factors must be considered: that apical segments older than about 48 hours generally are as physiologically mature as most other segments on the thallus (Section VI) and hence the separation into \"apical\" and \"midway\" segments is not necessarily meaningful, and that cuneata has, in addition to the regular segments, stalk and collar segments (Section IV). The stalk region is uncalcified; the extent of the aragonite deposits in collar segments has not been critically examined.",

There must be further variations in carbonate content with local circumstance and with time of year. Thalli of some species, for example, appear to be more heavily calcified in deeper water ( Fig. 88 ; Bohm, 1973a) . But in spite of these caveats it seems reasonable to proceed to compute a carbonate flux using the estimate for a typical dead incrassata segment as given in Table XXX . scanty. There are no field data beyond the general observation that white moribund segments are observed on wild plants, that plants do die as entire thalli and that death of the entire thallus always follows the release of gametes. None of these observations of wild plants allows estimates of either the frequency of death or the frequency at which single segments are shed. For the best approximations it is necessary to use data from our laboratory cultures. In the aquaria cultures individual plants of incrassata have lived for as long as two years, though the latter part of such a life seems to be spent covered in epiphytes, or under attack from epiphytes which have to be removed at frequent intervals. Plants in that condition have been seen in the field, but they are not usual and it is hard to believe that they can persist. On the other hand, there is no evidence for rapid turnover of populations as occurs in culture with Penicillus of which there may be four or six laboratory generations per year. For want of better data it is, perhaps, conservative and best to assume that a typical wild incrassata would live out the more vigorous part of its laboratory term of months, which allows us to assume that it contributes its total stock of segments in the white senile condition in a year.",

Neumann and Land (1975) made similar calculations for the whole Bight of Abaco in the Bahamas, a shallow basin of 2750 km^. With an average density of Halimeda plants of 25 m\"^they estimated the standing crop of the whole Bight of Abaco to produce 25-47 x 10** g carbonate. If we assume one crop a year, as was done above, this gives a carbonate flux of 9-26 g m\"^yr~^, or one-tenth of the estimate for the Glory Be reef. The discrepancy is undoubtedly due to the different Halimeda densities. A density of Halimeda of only 25 plants m\"^is low unless it is a species like macroloba. Sand-dwellers may grow at densities 20 times this, and higher densities still are represented by the sprawling thalli oi opuntia plants growing on rocks at densities of 90% cover. The figures actually used for the Bight of Abaco work are in fact several times larger than the 9-26 g m~2 yi--i calculated from the Abaco data here because it was assumed that there would be 6-12 crops oi Halimeda per year. As is argued above, there is no evidence for such rapid turnover in Halimeda. Stockman et al. (1967) made a similar budget for the production of lime muds in Florida by Penicillus, concluding that Penicillus contributed between 3 g and 25 g carbonate m.~^yr^^. These results depended on very low population densities of between two and eight plants per square metre, but the passage of six generations a year. This generation time is in accord with my experience of growing Penicillus in laboratory culture, it having a shorter life-cycle than Halimeda. But it is possible for Penicillus to exist at much higher densities than were found in the Florida study, when the total Penicillus carbonate production could equal that of the Halimedae of Glory Be reef.",

We need field data for the typical length of life of the various species, but it seems likely that more than one to three generations a year, depending somewhat on species, will be found to be unusual. Some additional data are provided by the observations of R. Spies, P. Lamberson and myself on an experimental plot of cylindraceae in Enewatak Lagoon, in which over 70% of the original thalli were present at the end of 4 months.

In the analysis of the mass of an atoll given above and in Fig. 84, it was suggested that the growth of a reef should be considered in two parts : the reef ridges and the lagoonal areas. In the former there is very active growth of the coral assemblage and encrusting algae, in the latter there is a large contribution of Halimeda and other green macrophytes. Smith and Kinsey (1976) likewise divided reef systems into two components, and further suggest that each has a characteristic modal rate of carbonate production. Smith and Kinsey (1976) give calculations of carbonate production for the Enewetak reef ridge based on measures of the changing alkalinity of the waters flowing over the reef. Their measures are thus comparable to the measures of carbon fixation by fiow-respirometry, and give a direct measure of carbonate accumulation on the section of the reef accessible to the technique. Accumulation on the reef ridge is given as 4 kg m\"^yr~^. This is contrasted with estimates for lagoons and other still-water sites of 0-8 kg m~2 yr~i. Where the lagoon is of considerable size, as in many atolls and barrier reefs, this bimodal division of production rates indicates that the lagoonal environments probably contribute most to the mass of the reef, since the area of the lagoon only has to be four to five times that of the reef ridges for its total contribution to be the larger.",

Dense populations in shallow water at Glorj^Be, Enewetak and elsewhere of an incrassata-cylindracea type of thallus have about 100 plants m\"^. A clearly visible growth of Halimeda over the floor of a whole lagoon, therefore, would produce about one-tenth of the total estimate of Smith and Kinsey. This is by no means impossible and there are reports in the literature of lagoon floors having what seem, from a ship-board collecting station, to be dense covers of Halimeda (Emery et al., 1954) . On two dives to the floor of the Enewetak Lagoon in 1975, however, I found that much of the visible terrain was almost devoid of Halimedae. Shallower lagoons (Enewetak is from 40 m to 70 m deep), however, may have denser stands. But there are also other factors to be taken into account.",

Halimeda opuntia at Glory Be attained local cover densities of 90%, which is roughly equivalent to an incrassata population of 900 plants m~^, and, since the sprawling life-form of these plants always tends to produce high cover, like the tillering patterns of grasses, local populations always tend to be dense. Some of the pinnacles at Enewetak support considerable populations of Opuntioid forms, and the total vertical faces of the pinnacles must be very large. With over 2000 pinnacles in the lagoon, if the lagoon were drained the aspect would be rather like the teeth of a rubber hair-brush.

Some considerable part of the production of the deep fore -reef, which contributes heavily to the sediments of the island slope of Jamaica (Fig. 86) , may be swept up in the vigorous onshore currents of these atolls, to be deposited later in the still waters of lagoons.",

As with all reef studies there are constantly in the background questions of how the reefs were built, but these questions are again likely to be phrased from the point of view of Halimeda: \"In what way have the Halimeda populations contributed to the structure and mass of the reef?\" It is suggested that this might be a timely bias, since the great majority of studies on coral reef systems have been designed on the unspoken assumption that the essential process in reef-building is the construction of the coral framework. It has already been mentioned (Section IX) that the classic studies on reef productivity, like those of Sargent and Austin (1954) and Odum and Odum (1955) , are of small sections of inter-island reefs in which Halimeda is entirely absent or a minor component. And yet Halimeda is one of the principal contributors to reef structure, sometimes perhaps the most important one (Section, IX) . Two reef systems have been examined with Halimeda principally in mind. They are a section of the fringing reef on the north shore of Jamaica where a Halimeda census was made (Hillis-Colinvaux, 1972) , and Enewetak Atoll where two Halimeda investigators have dived.",

These reef zones need to be understood in the context of the reef nomenclature established by Goreau and his laboratory, the usages of which have changed slightly over the years. In Table XXXIII the Goreau equivalents are given as they appear in Goreau and Goreau (1973) . The comparison of the Glory Be nomenclature with Goreau's reveals not only a finer classification of the near-shore zones at Glory Be, but also some added features of the Glory Be reef system not present in Goreau's generalized Goreau calls the inshore zone. These subdivisions each represent a very different habitat, and it is suspected that the four zones together are important to the total carbonate, carbon and Halimeda-segment flux of the reef. The combined inshore zone at Glory Be is separated from the shore side of a reefflat: Zoanthus zone (6) by a lagoon (5) as in the Goreau typical reef. During the two periods of work at the reef, waves did not break at the palmata zone, even though in Goreau's general model they do, and he regards the palmata zone and the breaker zone as one and the same. At Glory Be the waves broke at the leading edge of the reef flat ( Fig. 89) , after crossing the inundated Acropora cervicornis a,nd palmata corals or mixed zone (8) and the moat (7). For this reason we originally called the Glory Be zone (7) \"the breaker zone\", and it is so described in Hillis-Colinvaux (1974) . palmata zone has a more restricted interpretation than in the 1959 description of the reefs, where it is appHed to the entire region between reef flat and buttresses, which in turn are followed by a cervicornis zone. The palmata zone, as delimited by Goreau and Goreau (1973) The zonal boundaries in this system are distinct and can easily be identified both in the water and on the panorama (Fig. 89) made from the top of the cliff. The lengths and widths of the principal features of Fig. 89 were measured by identifying salient features such as individual rocks from the top of the cliff and on copies of the panorama, then taping the distances directly with a nylon line. Twenty-four lengths measured in this way were sufficient to compute the surface area occupied by each zone. Rough estimates for the mean width of each zone can also be made from a copy of the panorama on which the measured distances are superimposed, allowing the calculation of the relative areas of each zone along a metre-wide transect from the cliff to the outer channel. These estimates (Table XXXIII) Nearest-neighbour samples were most convenient in sandy areas where Halimeda populations were sparse and where the swell made it hard for a diver to keep station. The diver chose one plant as it drifted into view, placed one edge of a steel rule against it, and pivoted to find the other plant of the pair. Estimates of percentage cover were found to be the only practicable way of assessing densities of the sprawling plants of opuntia and goreauii. The census occupied about 30 hours of bottom time.",

A density of 500 incrassata m~^covers 50%, so 100% cover is taken as the equivalent of 1000 thalli m~2. The crudeness of this conversion for opuntia is selfevident, and it may be that the close-packed branches of a 90% cover stand of opuntia produce considerably more than would 900 incrassata plants.

None is regularly exposed at low tide. Of the remaining species, monile appears to be restricted to shallow water, and discoidea is limited essentially to the fore-reef and fore-reef slope (although it grows in shallow water elsewhere in the Caribbean). The thalli of discoidea sometimes appear to be growing in sand, but on closer examination they are invariably attached to some rock outcrop concealed by a thinnish veneer of sand. The species copiosa and cryptica are restricted mostly to the fore -reef slope and upper part of the deep fore-reef, that is, to depths of approximately 25-100 m. Halimeda copiosa, however, does occur in shallower water in the Pacific (see below and Section IV). These two species are the only ones to establish sizeable populations on the deep fore-reef (Goreau and Goreau, 1973) , with cryptica being the more abundant.",

In addition, the few opuntia plants growing in the fringe had a conspicuously rounded cushion or cropped habit, and lacked the straggly projecting branches which result from active growth (Fig. 51) .

The Thalassia stands constitute welldefined communities, the sand consolidated by a network of Thalassia rhizomes (Fig. 96) , and some of the less dense may contain very sizeable populations of Halimeda, or the dense Halimeda patches may be in adjacent areas. These especially thick Thalassia stands are restricted to shallow water between -0-5m and -3 m. Even in apparently optimum sites the distribution of the Thalassia stands is patchy, and there is evidence that the patches themselves are unstable. Most patches terminate in what could well be called a blow-out : there is an Fig. 96 . Edge of a dense stand of Thalassia testudinum, partly fringed by other sea grasses such as Diplanthera wrightii. Here the calcareous alga Penicillus capitatus, with some Udotea, is prominent towards the edge of the bed, and extends into the sand of the lower left. There is a suggestion of a rotational process of colonizing sand, consolidation of the sand by sea-grass rhizomes, development of the dense Halimeda and other populations, and physical destruction of the community. abrupt edge, with barren sand adjacent, and the discontinuity between the Thalassia community and the bare sand reveals a vertical section of the sand consolidated by the Thalassia rhizomes which in places is about 10 cm high. These observations suggest very strongly that there is a rotational process of colonizing sand, consolidation of the sand by sea grass rhizomes, development of the dense Halimeda and other alga or sea grass populations, and then physical destruction of the community. The dynamics of this process are of immense importance to the total Halimeda productivity of the reef. (b) Grazing and the Opuntioid forms. Straggling growth-forms of opuntia on rocks form the densest Halimeda stands, reaching covers of about 90%, which is probably more than the equivalent of 900 Rhipsalian Halimedae per square metre. There seems to be good reason for thinking that the sites where densities like these can be attained are limited by grazers for many opuntia patches show direct signs of having been grazed, and apparently suitable sites are both barren of opuntia and are the habitat or territory of some urchins or fishes. It is possible that there are seasonal or periodic fluctuations in grazer populations, in which event total Halimeda densities may fluctuate very widely from time to time. (c) Factors restricting Halimeda on bare bottoms. Halimeda populations are low on the sandy bottom of the moat and on the fore-reef terrace. For the sandy, duned parts of the moat that lacked vegetation, the explanation may be that the sands are kept too mobile by the wave surge, and that only exceptionally well-anchored plants survive. On the barrens of the moat floor urchin grazing is a possibility, because high densities of urchins were found, and the vegetation which was there, a short soft algal fuzz, is a life-form that might result from heavy grazing.",

Thirty-five atomic devices have been exploded at Enewetak, and the bomb craters themselves are sometimes interesting sites for marine botany. As always, research has been concentrated on processes leading to the construction, maintenance, productivity and geology of the reef framework, with processes in the lagoon and among the macrophyte populations examined to a lesser extent. Geology and the structure of the reefs are described in Emery et al. (1954) and Ladd (1973) , with Ladd also providing a list of the chapters of U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 260 which reports on the Marshall Islands. Some of the results of core drilling of the reef are reviewed in Section IX. The classic studies of production on reef ridges by Odum and Odum (1955) , as well as the more recent studies of the SYMBIOS group (Johannes et al, 1972; Pomeroy et al, 1974; Webb et al, 1975; Wiebe et al, 1975 ), also described Enewetak systems, with the earlier work of Sargent and Austin (1954) carried out in another atoll of the same group of islands. Taylor's (1950) survey as part of the preparations for Operation Crossroads. Taylor's monograph is essentially the results of many dredge hauls made as the requirements of military logistics allowed. Dawson (1957) added to the algal collections by diving, but the main effort at ecological marine botany by diving was the work of Gilmartin (1960 Gilmartin ( , 1966 . In the first paper Gilmartin described the lagoon bottom, and collections of algae at 21 stations, comprising a complete east-west transect of the lagoon and reaching to the maximum depth at about 65 m. It should be noted that the sand-dwelling Halimeda found most commonly by Gilmartin and described as monile is now properly known as cylindracea.

Its windward side is consequently subjected to steady wave attack for about 9 months of the year. Its southern reefs are protected from the trade winds, but are periodically damaged by powerful long-period swells from the southern hemisphere, whereas the reefs of the west and north-west are exposed to relatively calm seas. These differences in the physical environment of the portions of reef bordering the small islets create an initial series of varied macrohabitats, to which are added the different conditions presented by the channels between the islets, and a lagoon of approximately 39 km in diameter, about 65 m at its deepest, with more than 2000 coral knolls or pinnacles (Fig. 83, bottom) and its own circulation system (von Arx, 1948 ).",

But since the slope break occurs over a range of many metres (Stoddart, 1969 ; Orme, 1977 ; Smith Pass between Lojwa( north) and Alembel their Halimeda and Tydemania species. Halimeda species: Al = incrassata, A2 = cylindracea, A3stuposa; Bl = opuntia, B2 = copiosa, B3 = distorta, B4 = minima; C2 = gigas, C3gracilis, C4 = lacunalis f. lata, C5 = m,acrophysa, C6 = taenicola; Dl = inicronesica, D2 = fragilis. TydewMtiia species: T = expeditionis. (Modified from Hillis-Colinvaux, 1977.) and Harrison, 1977) , it is better called the fore-reef terrace. Proceeding shoreward a spur and groove region is encountered, and breaking the surface at low tide is the algal ridge. Development of spur-groove and algal ridges vary considerably, however, and they may be absent. The spur-groove system is best developed on the windward sides of atolls ; on the lee side smooth margins are the pattern (Tracy et al., 1948) . The algal ridge has traditionally been called the \" Lithothamnion ridge\", and the component algae referred to as Lithothamneae or \"nullipores\". The name is a misleading one, however, brought about in part by the tediousness, in the early stages of the taxonomy of the group, of identifying the calcareous algae involved, for Lithothamnion is a minor component, if present at all. The commonest members of the ridge are species of Neogoniolithon, Porolithon and Lithophyllum, and up to ten genera commonly may be present (Adey and Maclntyre, 1973) . This ridge, showing various degrees of development, also occurs in the Caribbean (Adey, 1975 ; , and it therefore does not represent a difference between the reefs of Atlantic and Pacific as formerly believed (Stoddart, 1969; Milliman, 1974) . To the region of shallow waters shoreward of the ridge I have applied the general term back-reef (or reef flat). I have not subdivided it according to predominant coral type as is commonly done, since these divisions are not meaningful to our present understanding of Halimeda distribution at Enewetak.",

The within-habitat diversity, sensu MacArthur (1965) , at any place in the atoll, however, is low (Hillis-Colinvaux, 1977) . Twenty-one sites were examined during a 3 -week visit to Enewetak, and at no station were as many as half the species found ( Fig. 97) . At only 10% of the stations were there six species, and at 40% of the stations there were three or fewer. At two stations, including the site of the Odum transect, no Halimedae were found. A station represented about 1-2 h of diving time. A striking observation first made by Gilmartin (1960) is that both sand-and rock-adapted species are found at all depths of the lagoon, from the shallows to the bottom, though relative abundance and diversity appear to decrease with depth.",

There are six nuclear craters underwater or in the reef flats of Enewetak which provide sites for Halimeda colonists, and I examined two of them, CACTUS and LACROSSE, in December 1975 . Both are at the north end of Runit (Fig. 97) . The larger, LACROSSE, formed in May 1956, is in the back-reef, whereas CACTUS, formed almost exactly two years later, is more an inpocketing of an inter-island channel (Fig. 85 ). Both craters are open to the sea, but CACTUS had most of the crater rim submerged, and so was flushed, in its shallows at least, with flowing reef water. Both craters were floored with very fine sediments, probably including clay-sized particles. I saw no sediments of comparable fineness elsewhere in the atoll. Both sediment bodies were contaminated with radionuclides. These craters are particularly interesting as sites for colonizers, and sites, moreover, with sediments of a size fraction not widespread in the neighbourhood. Unfortunately it is reported that CACTUS crater, the more interesting one, has been filled in as part of the recent clean-up operation on the atoll.",

Masses of some of these filaments also grew out of the sand-rock substrate some distance from pinnacles. These Holimeda populations of the sides of pinnacles require more study because they may well be principal suppliers of carbonate to the reef floor.

At depths of 1-2 m at low tide it was common near the undercut bases of coral heads and hidden in Acropora thickets.

In shallow parts in the north the two species together formed extensive meadows, though these are not really comparable to the incrassata meadows of Jamaica. Perhaps more significantly, these meadows in no way compare to the Thalassia meadows of Jamaica, not even in the apparent density of the Halimeda contribution to the Jamaican Thalassia meadows. It was remarked in the study of Glory Be that a Thalassiadominated community seemed to be involved in stabilizing patches of sand, and that Rhipsalian Halimedae were more abundant near or in these communities than in the open. Part of the low density of Rhipsalian Halimedae at Enewetak, therefore, may be a reflection of the absence of sea grasses.

But the floor is not so covered. This was first demonstrated by Gilmartin (1960) and our observations confirm this (Fig. 102b ). There are very low densities oi cylindracea (called monile in Gilmartin's paper), particularly near the bases of coral pinnacles. But for the most part the lagoon floor has few populations of Halimeda, and the ones that are there are rock-attached forms on coral blocks, particularly macrophysa. Gilmartin (1960) noted changes in the form of cylindracea with depth ( Fig. 104) , and postulated that the paucity of the species on the lagoon floor was a function of two processes : low light intensity and disturbance by burrowing animals. The relative prominence of animal mounds and castings on the lagoon floor near the base of pinnacles in 40 m of water certainly encourages acceptance of Gilmartin's hypothesis.",

Ross, then Keeper of Botany of the British Museum (Natural History), and my colleagues there, for the privileges and pleasure associated with the Fellowship year, and for courtesies and assistance extended to me on other visits as well.",

    "abstract": "Background: Asthma is a chronic disorder of both adults and children affecting more than 300 million people heath worldwide. Diagnose and treatment for asthma, particularly in childhood asthma have always remained a great challenge because of its complex pathogenesis and multiple triggers, such as allergen, viral infection, tobacco smoke, dust, etc. It is thereby great significant to deeply investigate the transcriptome changes in asthmatic children before and after desensitization treatment, in order that we could identify potential and key mRNAs and lncRNAs which might be considered as useful RNA molecules for observing and supervising desensitization therapy for asthma, which might guide the diagnose and therapy in childhood asthma. Methods: In the present study, we performed a systematic transcriptome analysis based on the deep RNA sequencing of ten asthmatic children before and after desensitization treatment, including identification of lncRNAs using a stringent filtering pipeline, differential expression analysis and network analysis, etc. Results: First, a large number of lncRNAs were identified and characterized. Then differential expression analysis revealed 39 mRNAs and 15 lncRNAs significantly differentially expressed which involved in two biological processes and pathways. A co-expressed network analysis figured out a desensitization-treatment-related module which contains 27 mRNAs and 21 lncRNAs using WGCNA R package. Module analysis disclosed 17 genes associated to asthma at distinct level. Subsequent network analysis based on PCC figured out several key lncRNAs probably interacted to those key asthma-related genes, i.e., LINC02145, GUSBP2. Our functional investigation indicated that their functions might involve in immune, inflammatory response and apoptosis process. Conclusions: Our study successfully discovered many key noncoding RNA molecules related to pathogenesis of asthma and relevant treatment, which may provide some clues for asthmatic diagnose and therapy in future.",

In China, the prevalence of childhood asthma increased extremely since 1990s, which ranged from 0.93% in 1990 to 1.54% in 2000 [3] . There is no definitive explanation for this increase, even though the prevalence of asthma in children has increased over decades. More importantly, there is no full cure is available up to now despite majority of children with asthma can alleviate the asthmatic symptoms and obtain adequate asthma control via avoidance of triggering factors, rational management and/or medication, such as short-acting inhaled \u03b22-receptor agonists [4, 5] . However, a small proportion (~5%) of asthmatic children have uncontrolled asthma despite maximum medical treatment [6] . In addition, diagnosing asthma in children faces challenge as well, e.g., a number of childhood conditions exhibit compatible symptoms to those caused by asthma, such as shortness of breath, wheezing and cough [5] . To further complicate the issue, those conditions can coexist with asthma and confuse the evaluation of patients.",

Concretely, genome-wide association studies have detected numerous asthma-associated gene variants, while few of them (less than 10%) can be explained to contribute to the risk of asthma [10] . On the other hand, environmental factors have been reported to modulate epigenetic modifications and thereby affect gene expression and phenotype [11, 12] . Epigenetic mechanisms have been reported to be key to functions of airway smooth muscle (ASM), e.g., aberrant phenotype of ASM lead to the obstruction and inflammation of airway [13] . Therefore, diverse cellular compartments orchestrated by multiple environment-driving factors make the mechanisms underlying asthma extraordinary complex and unclear, particularly with respect to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).",

                "text": "lncRNAs have been reported to possess multiple functions including regulation of gene expression, transcriptional activation and silencing of genes and thus play critical roles in a diversity of cellular process [14, 15] . Aberrant expression of many specific lncRNAs was reported to be correlated to the pathogenesis of various diseases in human and model animals [16, 17] . Furthermore, the roles of lncRNAs implicated in asthma have been emerged recently. Several studies achieved by whole genome RNA-seq have identified many lncRNAs specifically expressed in T cells at varying stages of development and differentiation [18] . For instances, the lncRNA named Tmevpg1 was found to be uniquely expressed by the T helper cell 1 (TH1) and is essential to the transcription of Ifng by TH1 subset [19] . The lncRNA GATA3-AS1 transcribed in the opposite direction from GATA3 was reported to be co-expressed with GATA3 in mouse and human TH2 cells [20] . TH2 cells responses have already demonstrated to link to both allergy and asthma. However, the gaps between the function of the lncRNAs specifically expressed in immune system or T lymphocytes and asthma still unfilled and require further deep investigation, e.g., despite GATA3-AS1 may play a role in asthmatic response, its functions are unknown. Here, to attempt to fill some of those gaps and identify the novel lncRNAs which might be useful molecules for observing and supervising desensitization therapy for childhood asthma, we performed a systematic transcriptome analysis based on the deep RNA-seq data of peripheral whole blood of ten asthmatic children before and after desensitization treatment.",

As a result, a total of 52,791 known lncRNAs were detected. On the other hand, we applied a stringent stepwise filtering pipeline ( Fig. 1) to identify novel lncRNAs. This analysis generated 5310 novel lncRNAs (Table S4 ). Furthermore, aimed at assessing the quality of identified lncRNAs, we performed a comparative study between lncRNAs and mRNAs before and after treatment in the transcript length, exon counts, open reading frame (ORF) length and expression level (Fig. 2) . The results indicated that there was no obvious difference of expression level among these patients no matter in mRNAs or lncRNAs ( Fig. 2a ). The similar situation exists in the comparison of expression before and after treatment (Fig. 2b) . In consistent patterns of with previous studies of eukaryotic lncRNAs, the length of the majority of identified lncRNAs and the corresponding ORF was much shorter than that of mRNAs ( Fig. 2c, d ), and the exon count of the lncRNAs was also less than that of mRNAs ( Fig. 2e) .",

The optimal power for the scale-free topology fit index was calculated out for construction of hierarchical clustering tree ( Figure S2 ). This analysis clustered all the correlated transcripts into 80 modules with strong correlation with trait ( Figure S3 ). Each module contains independent datasets of transcripts (includes mRNAs and lncRNAs). The interactions among those modules were visualized in Figure S4 with randomly selected transcripts. After that, the modules significantly associated with specific trait (desensitization treatment) was detected using the function plotEigengeneNetworks of WGCNA ( Table 2) . The results showed that a module (khaki1) were significantly correlated to the trait (desensitization treatment) ( Fig. 5 ), which contains 27 mRNAs and 21 lncRNAs.

Concretely, four genes (ATF7IP, SLC43A3, AKAP7, HMGN1) were found to be correlated to pathogenesis or treatment of asthma in immune. For instance, ATF7IP can form a protein-complex by binding to MBD1 (methyl CpG binding protein 1) and Aire (autoimmune regulator) to maintain immune tolerance [23] . Immunological tolerance to self-antigens is critical to the prevention of autoimmune disease, including asthma. In addition, two genes (ELMO2, WDFY1) were demonstrated to play roles in inflammation response of asthma. ELMO2 was found as an ILK-binding protein to play key role in integration of adhesion and migration pathways. Abnormal regulation of migration is associated to chronic autoinflammatory disorder, such as asthma [33] . Furthermore, two genes (G2E3, ZNF19) were found to be differentially methylated between asthmatics and nonasthmatics [34, 35] . Combined with four apoptosis-related genes, all those asthma-related genes could be summarized in Table 3 .",

Despites there is no clinical significance was reported in this known lncRNA, our analysis indicated that its strong association with asthma before and after desensitization treatment. A similar situation was found in a novel lncRNA MSTR G.18506.1 which interacts with three asthma-related genes, i.e., SPDYE6, ATF7IP, VPS37A. Interestingly, in addition to lncRNAs, we found some other types of noncoding RNAs exhibited correlations with asthma-related genes, including antisense, snoRNA, snRNA and pseudogene. To test our findings that those specific lncRNAs and mRNAs probably associated to immune/inflammatory-related genes in asthma, we selected three lncRNA/mRNAs, including KLRK1, LINC02145, GUSBP2, which exhibits differential expression before and after treatment for the qRT-PCR. The results were demonstrated to be consistent to our bioinformatic analysis ( Figure S7 ).",

Despite the function of majority of Fig. 4 Differential expression analysis between before treatment and after treatment. a Heatmap of expression profiles using differentially expressed transcripts. The heatmap was visualized using R package gplots, all expression values were normalized using Z-score using R package DESeq2. b Functional GO enrichment analysis based on differentially expressed transcripts using Metascape lncRNAs are unknown so far, their important roles in diverse biological processes has already been demonstrated, particularly close correlations to diseases. In the present study, we detected at least one order of magnitude lncRNAs larger than those identified in our previous studies about lncRNAs [38, 42, 43] . One of reason is the strategy of RNA sequencing in our previous studies is to capture the RNAs with polyA tail (mRNAs), which could only identify around half of lncRNAs. Here we applied total RNA sequencing technology to capture all linear RNAs, which contains most of lncRNAs. In addition, we improved the analysis pipeline for identification of lncRNAs used in our previous studies, which mainly focused on the identification of novel lncRNAs. Then the differential expression analysis showed that only a small proportion of RNAs were differentially expressed in asthmatic patients before and after treatment. The possible reason is that asthma as a chronic respiratory disease, treatment of it might not directly be reflected in peripheral blood. The RNA change triggered by treatment in asthmatic patients might mainly occur in airway epithelium. This is one limitation of our study. This limitation could be solved by using the deep RNA sequencing data of airway epithelium cell. Another limitation to be noted is that ten individuals participated in the present study are composed of nine male children and one female child. To our knowledge, gender, in particular during pubertal period (one female child in this study is 15 years old) might affect the results of differential expression analysis. To be clear, the results and the conclusions in the present study are based mainly on male population of asthmatic childhood patients. Regardless, the functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed transcripts indicated their functions might be involved in humoral immune response. Humoral immune response is one of two main arms of the immune system, which triggers specific B cells to proliferate and secrete large amounts of their specific antibodies. This process attracts a helper T (T H ) cell to be activated against a particular antigen, which implying its importance in immune response to asthma.",

Although correlation value of the most trait-related (khaki1) module is not very significant (only reach 0.63) compared to other WGCNA studies, this analysis successfully figured out several mRNAs and lncRNAs correlated to asthma treatment. Functional analysis on these transcripts within the desensitizationtreatment-related module revealed four genes (TRIO, PEA15, KLRK1, NDUFA13) significantly enriched in the positive regulation of apoptotic process. This finding actually was consistent to previous studies for asthma [39] [40] [41] . Concretely, KLRK1 encodes NKG2D, and aberrant expression of NKG2D ligands has been reported in sites of inflammation and in tissues undergoing autoimmune pathologies, including asthma [44] . Also, Klrk1 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited a profoundly impaired inflammatory response to allergen challenge compared with klrk1 +/+ mice [36] . The qRT-PCR experiment for KLRK1 based on our samples indicated that the expression of KLRK1 was up-regulated after desensitization treatment, which might alleviate the inflammatory response and respiratory symptoms. This result was consistent to our differential expression analysis, despites the expression difference is not very statistically significant (p value = 0.09676, Figure S7-B) . The possible reason may be that we just used three individuals for the qRT-PCR experiments, the sample size might limit the statistical power. The reason why we just used three individuals is that the blood sample was preserved too long despites we kept them refrigerated (\u2212 80\u00b0C), the RNAs of some samples are degraded at different degrees. We just found the RNAs of three samples were qualified for qRT-PCR experiments after the quality inspection. Another two transcripts (LINC02145, GUSBP2) for qRT-PCR validation had the same issue. Thereby, it is reasonable that these validations might be more significant if we use ten sample for qRT-PCR experiments. PEA15 has been proved as an important protein that regulates death receptor induced apoptosis and proliferation signaling by binding to FADD and relocating ERK1/2 to the cytosol. It regulates subcellular compartmentalization and activity of phosphoERK, and ERK1 was found to be important for Th2 differentiation and development of experimental asthma [37] . In addition, Sandra Pastorino et al's study showed that ablation of PEA-15 led to accumulation of ERK in the nucleus in PEA-15/ T cells, which would enhance the T-cell proliferation [45] . In asthma, stimuli can promote repair mechanisms to induce cellular proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, and delayed survival of inflammatory cells may in turn aggravate the respiratory symptoms. In the present study, our analysis indicated that the apoptotic process of asthmatic children was upregulated after desensitization treatment, which implies the asthmatic symptoms in those patients might be improved in different degrees. Notably, our analysis figured out a key lncRNA LINC02145 directly targeted on PEA15 (Fig. 7b) . Subsequent qRT-PCR on LINC02145 showed the expression of this lncRNA exhibited significant upregulation ( Figure S7 -C) after desensitization treatment, which might affect the expression of PEA15 and further regulates death receptor induced apoptosis and proliferation signaling and relieve the respiratory symptoms. Additionally, our analysis indicated that a pseudogene GUSBP2 (also defined as lncRNA in GeneCards Suite [46] ) was found to interact with KLRK1, as well as another two immune/inflammatory-related genes, including HMGN1 and WDFY1. HMGN1 encodes the nucleosome-binding protein, which was reported as a potent alarmin that binds TLR4 and induces antigenspecific Th1 immune responses [27] . WDFY1 could mediate Toll-like receptor3/4 (TLR3/4) signaling by recruiting TRIF. TLRs were found to be expressed in the lung tissue and some cells of innate and adaptive immune system. Abnormal expression of TLRs could lead to aberrant expression of many inflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators [36] . These 3 genes thereby have been well demonstrated to be closely associated to immune and inflammatory response in asthmatic status. Regarding GUSBP2, the associations with asthma actually has been reported in a microarray study for asthma, which showed that GUSBP2 was differentially expressed in comparison of asthmatic patients with health controls [47] . However, its detailed mechanisms in asthma was not illuminated. In the present study, our network analysis disclosed GUSBP2 exhibiting correlations to these immune/inflammatory-related genes, implying it might target to these genes to participate the regulation of immune and inflammatory process in asthma. Indeed, GUSBP2 was found as the highest up-regulated fold change of lncRNA in CD (Crohn's disease) patient plasma via microarray screening [48] . CD is known to us as one of inflammatory bowel diseases, which suggests the existence of strong association between GUSBP2 and inflammatory reaction. In the present study, our qRT-PCR experiment on GUSBP2 indicated that the expression of GUSBP2 was up-regulated after desensitization treatment ( Figure S7-A) . This finding was also consistent with our differential expression analysis. The result indicated that the expression of GUSBP2 was repressed in asthmatic patients compared to healthy controls (Figure S8) . Subsequent network analysis based on PCC method displayed that GUSBP2 might target on KLRK1, whose expression was also already found to be upregulated after desensitization treatment. Notably, the cutoff of correlation value was not set to traditional threshold (0.9~0.95) since the correlation between those transcripts in this study is not as strong as our previous lncRNA studies [38, 43] . One of possible reason is that the desensitization treatment might not make a big change of RNAs in peripheral blood of these asthmatics, which further led to weak correlations among those RNAs. This also is the reason that it is not easily to figure out key RNAs related to asthma or treatment simply via differential expression analysis, thereby we applied co-expression network analysis, a relatively robust and sensitive strategy for our study. Our findings indicated that the desensitization treatment might induce GUSBP2 positively work with KLRK1 to alleviate the inflammatory response and the respiratory symptoms. To validate this further, we analyzed a expression data which derives from GEO database (accession number: GSE2125), which sequenced 45 alveolar macrophages from human subjects (30 non-smoker healthy people and 15 asthmatic patients). The result showed that both genes exhibited a higher expression level in healthy controls ( Figure  S8 ). Subsequent study on relationship between GUSBP2 and KLRK1 using PCC method indicated that they have a moderate correlation (PCC value = 0.538), which was consistent with It was also implied that GUSBP2 and KLRK1 might play important roles in the occurrence of asthma and might be potential useful RNA molecules for therapy and diagnosis in asthma.",

All patients completed questionnaires on their demographics and medical history and fulfilled the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) criteria for allergic rhinitis and/or the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria [49] for mild-to-moderate asthma, sIgE to Der p, and Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f). The detailed information for these patients was summarized in Table 4 . For each individual, peripheral whole blood was extracted and then the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) was separated from it using ficoll-paque. After that, the total RNA was extracted using trizol (invitrogen) method and the RNA quality was assessed using ND-1000 Nanodrop and Agilent 2200 TapeStation. the library for deep RNA sequencing was prepared according to a standard protocol established by RiboBio company in Guangzhou. The rRNAs were removed using Ribo-Zero\u2122 Rrna Removal Reagent (Human/Mouse/Rat)-Illumina and library was prepared using NEBNext\u00ae Ultra\u2122 Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina, USA NEB company.

Reaction condition: 95\u00b0C 10 min heating, 95\u00b0C 15 s denaturing, 60\u00b0C 30 s annealing, 70\u00b0C 30 s extension, 40 cycles. All reactions had 3 duplicates, CCAT1, E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression in colorectal tissue was calculated with 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct method. One-side T-test was used to test whether there is a difference in the expression level between groups before and after desensitization treatment. These analyses were achieved on the open source statistical programing language R. Concretely, the function shapiro.test() was used to test whether two groups before and after desensitization treatment are normal distribution. The function var.test() was used to test whether two groups are equal variance. The function t.test() was used to perform paired t-test for two groups.",

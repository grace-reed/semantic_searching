                "text": "Autophagosome biogenesis requires the dual actions of the Atg4 class of endopeptidases to first cleave newly synthesized Atg8 at conserved C-terminal glycine residues (a process known as priming), and then later to delipidate autophagosome-bound Atg8 (through hydrolysis of the glycine-phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) bond that is formed during autophagosome biogenesis). 1, 2 Studies in yeast, which contain only one copy each of Atg4 and Atg8, have demonstrated the indispensible role of Atg8 priming during autophagy, 1 and have also highlighted the importance of the delipidation step during late stages of autophagosome maturation when material is delivered to the vacuole for degradation. 3 The situation in mammalian cells is more complex, because these contain four Atg4 family members (Atg4A, B, C, D; also known as \"autophagins\" 4 ) and seven Atg8 family members (LC3A, B, C and 4 GABARAPs; e.g., ref. 5) . Understanding the individual functions of these family members has proved challenging, although a picture is now emerging of cooperative/sequential actions for LC3 and GABARAP family members during early stages of autophagosome assembly, in turn regulated by Atg4 proteins with broad Atg8 specificity (e.g., Atg4B 7 ), or with a preference for individual Atg8 proteins (Atg4A for GATE-16 8 ; Atg4D for GABARAP-L1 ). It is conceivable, then, that assembly of autophagosomes in response to disparate autophagic stimuli in mammalian cells will involve tight spatiotemporal regulation of the actions of specific Atg4 family members, and corresponding fine-tuning of Atg8 recruitment to the nascent autophagosome. By this model, different autophagosomal properties including their size, 5, 6 their preferred cargoes (e.g. ), and perhaps also their directed transport to lysosomes could be programmed by the balance of Atg8 classes, affording cells with considerable functional flexibility in their autophagosomal populations.",

Hence, the tight spatial control of Atg4 action is an essential facet of the autophagosome biogenesis pathway: cells need Atg4 for Atg8 priming, but too much Atg4 activity blocks autophagosome formation at the expansion stage via unregulated Atg8 delipidation. Once assembled, autophagosomes retain Atg8 on their outer surface throughout their maturation. 13 In yeast, removal of Atg8 via delipidation may be coupled with autophagosome/vacuole fusion, because in cells in which delipidation is prevented (DAtg4 cells) delivery of cargo to the vacuole is dramatically delayed. Although the comparable scenario has not been tested in mammalian cells, these data nevertheless point once more to a requirement for tight spatial control of Atg4 activities during autophagosome assembly, maturation and fusion with degradative compartments.",

                "text": "As further evidence for post-translational control of Atg4 function, we have demonstrated that Atg4D is subject to caspase cleavage at DEVD 63 during apoptosis, and that cleavage stimulates Atg4D priming and delipidation activities toward GABARAP-L1 in vitro. 9 Exactly how caspase cleavage of Atg4D contributes to cellular stress responses remains unclear. Importantly, it has recently been documented that several other human autophagy proteins-including all Atg4 family members-can be subject to caspase and/or calpain cleavage: 14 Atg4A is cleaved in vitro at its C-terminus by recombinant caspase-3, and centrally by calpain 1, while Atg4B is cleaved at its C-terminus by calpain 1 (the partial cleavage at the N-terminus of Atg4B reported in the presence of recombinant caspase-3 was most likely due to cleavage of the epitope tag 14 ) . Alignment of the N-terminal sequences of Atg4C and Atg4D reveals the presence of canonical DEVD caspase sites in both, and we predicted that Atg4C would undergo a similar cleavage event at its corresponding site, DEVD. 9, 10 The recent data from Norman et al. are consistent with this prediction, and support a model in which both Atg4D and Atg4C undergo cleavage at identical N-terminal DEVD sites during apoptosis. 14 Accepting that various members of the mammalian Atg4 family are subject to regulation by apoptotic proteases, 9, 14 what might be the consequence of Atg4 cleavage in relation to endopeptidase action, autophagy and ultimately, cell fate? Based on published crystal structures of Atg4B in free form and in complex with LC3, the N-termini of Atg4 family members are predicted to partially occlude access/exit of Atg8 substrates at the active site. Notably, recombinant Atg4B lacking its N-terminus was demonstrated to have enhanced priming activity against LC3, leading us to speculate that caspase cleavage of Atg4D stimulates GABARAPL1 priming through removal of the auto-inhibitory N-terminal domain of Atg4D. 16 Whether Atg4C is subject to the same regulatory influences is less likely because its cleavage is predicted to only remove 10 amino acids from the N-terminus, possibly indicating different roles/consequences of caspase cleavage of these related Atg4 family members. Significantly, the caspase-cleaved form of Atg4D (DN63 Atg4D) was found to be highly toxic when overexpressed in HeLa cells; with cell death associated with the enrichment of Atg4D at the mitochondria and at least partly mediated by a BH3-type domain at the C-terminus of this protein. 9 Here, we provide data suggesting that caspase action may control the subcellular distribution of Atg4C and Atg4D. Immediately downstream of the caspase cleavage sites in these molecules are stretches of amino acids that constitute strong mitochondrial-targeting motifs. We show that these sequences are sufficient to target the caspase-cleaved forms of these proteins into mitochondria, and that HeLa cells expressing mitochondrial Atg4D are more susceptible to cell death mediated by prolonged mitochondrial uncoupling. Furthermore, we show that expression of mitochondrial-targeted Atg4D in differentiating human erythroblasts influences mitochondrial structure and density, leading to elevated ROS and advanced mitochondrial clearance (mitophagy) in this physiologically relevant system.",

One unexpected observation arising from our previous characterization of Atg4D was the tendency of this enzyme to associate with mitochondria during oxidative stress and cell death. 9 To determine the domain of Atg4D responsible for its dynamic mitochondrial targeting, we made truncation/deletion constructs with N-or C-terminal GFP or YFP fusions ( Fig. 1A) and transiently expressed these in HeLa cells ( Fig. 1B; Fig. S1 ). Most of these constructs gave similar staining patterns in viable cells, with strong cytosolic distribution super-imposed upon weaker reticular/ER patterns ( Fig. 1B; Fig. S1 ). The exception was caspase truncated DN63 Atg4D-GFP which was exclusively mitochondrial ( Fig. 1B; Fig. S1 ). Atg4D contains a proposed BH3 domain within its C-terminus that has the potential to engage Bcl-2 family members on the mitochondria or at the ER. A construct consisting of the C-terminus of Atg4D had the same subcellular distribution as full-length Atg4D, suggesting that the BH3 domain does not influence subcellular targeting of Atg4D (Fig. S1) . Notably, placing the GFP tag at the new N-terminus of DN63 Atg4D (i.e., GFP-DN63 Atg4D) blocked its mitochondrial association, suggesting that determinants immediately downstream of the caspase site might be responsible for targeting truncated Atg4D to the mitochondria (Fig. S1 ). Consistent with this observation, subcellular targeting algorithms (e.g., Mitoprot, http://ihg.gsf.de/ ihg/mitoprot.html) predicted that the sequence of the caspasecleaved form of Atg4D (DN63 Atg4D) would be targeted to mitochondria (Fig. 1C) . Additional processing to remove a putative mitochondrial-targeting domain at amino acid position RYRF 104 was also predicted by the software (Fig. 1C) , and consistent with this, a construct containing this domain was an excellent mitochondrial-targeting sequence for GFP (64-105 Atg4D-GFP; Fig. 1B; Fig. S1 ). Significantly, when we repeated this process using the comparable sequences in Atg4C, we observed the same phenomenon: amino acids 11-40 were predicted to form a mitochondrial-targeting domain (Fig. 1C) , and a 11-40 Atg4C-GFP construct was strongly targeted to mitochondria in HeLa cells (Fig. 1D ).",

As expected, in these cells, DN63 Atg4D was exclusively mitochondrial ( Fig. 2A) . We then used cellular fractionation to isolate mitochondria and mitoplasts (mitochondria lacking their outer membrane), which we then used in protease protection assays in the absence or presence of proteinase K (PK) ( Fig. 2A) . Blotting for the OMM protein Tom20, the inner membrane (IMM) protein OPA1 (optic atrophy 1), and the matrix resident HSP60 confirmed that the isolation process had been successful ( Fig. 2A) .

Immunoblotting confirmed that full-length Atg4D did not associate with mitochondria (~55 kDa form) (Fig. 2B) . By contrast, the majority of DN63 Atg4D-myc resolved at~42 kDa, with two additional species observed: one at~47 kDa (the expected size of DN63 Atg4D), and another at~45 kDa, which may be an intermediate product of mitochondrial metalloproteinase action (Fig. 2B) . Most significantly, we found that the 42 kDa form of Atg4D was retained in the proteinase Ktreated mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 2B) . This product resolved at the size predicted for Atg4D lacking both its N-terminal extension and mitochondrial-targeting domain, and is likely to represent the short form of Atg4D that we had previously described. Together, these data suggest that following caspase cleavage, Atg4D can be imported into mitochondrial matrix where it is processed to a~42 kDa product.

Whether this was due to the binding of Atg4D to the mitochondrial surface or to the uptake of Atg4D into mitochondria was not formally tested; however, because we observed this phenomenon using GFP-Atg4D (i.e., a construct with blocked mitochondrial import sequence), in the absence or presence of caspase inhibitors, the former possibility is much more likely. To examine this further, we expressed wild-type and caspase-resistant (DEVA 63 ) Atg4D-myc in HeLa cells and analyzed the pattern of Atg4D expression in the absence or presence of staurosporine (to induce apoptosis) ( Fig. 2C) . In crude lysates, wild-type Atg4Dmyc resolved as a 55 kDa full-length protein with evidence of a truncated 42kDa product (Fig. 2C) . Surprisingly, this pattern was similar in cells expressing caspase-resistant DEVA Atg4D-myc, implying that caspase cleavage may not be necessary for import into mitochondria and subsequent processing (Fig. 2C) . This is consistent with our previous detection of 42 kDa Atg4D in HeLa cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, in the presence of the caspase inhibitor, zVAD.fmk. 9 In cells treated with staurosporine, we observed a general decrease in the amount of full-length and 42 kDa Atg4D in both wild-type and DEVA expressing cells, which might indicate degradation of Atg4D by apoptotic proteases (Fig. 2C) . Notably, we did not observe any differences in the relative amounts of cytosolic or mitochondrial Atg4D between cells expressing wild-type or caspase-resistant Atg4D-myc in the presence of staurosporine (Fig. 2C ). To extend these findings, we compared the mitochondrial association of wild-type vs. caspase-resistant Atg4D in cells treated with staurosporine ( Fig. 2D) . Cell fractionation and PK treatment revealed that a fraction of 42 kDa Atg4D could always be found within mitochondria at steady-state, and that this fraction is not ",

Each of the cell lines responded similarly to amino acid starvation when analyzed for LC3 puncta numbers (Fig. 3B) . We also tested the responses of these cells to the induction of autophagy by short (15 min) treatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler, CCCP ( Fig. 3C and  D) . No differences in autophagosome numbers were observed between the cell lines ( Fig. 3D ), suggesting that the presence of Atg4D within mitochondria has minimal impact upon amino acid starvation and mitochondrial dysfunction-induced autophagy. We next subjected these cell lines to the apoptosis inducers anisomycin and staurosporine ( Fig. 3E ), or to prolonged exposure to the mitochondrial poisons CCCP and antimycin A (an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex III which increased cellular ROS) ( Fig. 3F) , and measured cell death by assessment of pyknotic chromatin and LDH release respectively. When treated with either anisomycin or staurosporine, the DN63 Atg4D-GFP cells consistently showed a trend toward greater susceptibility to apoptosis (Fig. 3E) ; however, this was not statistically significant leading us to conclude that mitochondrial-targeted Atg4D does not contribute to apoptosis under these conditions. Under basal conditions and in the presence of antimycin A, there were small but not significant increases in cell death in cells expressing wildtype DN63 Atg4D-GFP ( Fig. 3F) . By contrast, cell death was significantly greater in wild-type DN63 Atg4D-GFP cells treated with CCCP ( Fig. 3F) . This suggests that mitochondrial Atg4D sensitizes cells to cell death in the presence of mitochondrial uncouplers. Interestingly, cytoplasmic DN63 Atg4D is potently cytotoxic when overexpressed in HeLa cells, suggesting that the proposed import/sequestration of Atg4D within mitochondria may have a protective role. Furthermore, siRNA suppression of Atg4D expression sensitized HeLa cells to starvation and staurosporine, 9 suggesting that Atg4D is cytoprotective until caspase cleavage renders it cytotoxic, possibly via exposure or activation of its putative BH3 domain. 9 Altered mitochondrial physiology in primary human erythroblasts expressing mitochondrial DN63 Atg4D. Autophagy is dramatically upregulated during erythropoiesis, when it contributes to the removal of mitochondria and other organelles from the cytoplasm of the nascent erythrocyte. Recent studies in mice genetically depleted of key autophagy/mitophagy genes (e.g., Ulk1, Atg7, Nix) suggest that the failure to remove mitochondria at the correct stage of erythroid differentiation can cause elevated oxidative stress, reduced reticulocyte viability and chronic anemia. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Interestingly, sublethal caspase action has been shown to contribute to erythroblast terminal differentiation (e.g., see refs. 26 and 27) , prompting us to investigate the potential involvement of caspase-cleaved Atg4D during erythroid mitophagy. We used lentiviruses to generate primary human erythroid precursors stably expressing 64-105 Atg4D-GFP or caspase-cleaved wild-type DN63 Atg4D-GFP. To determine whether these constructs influence mitochondrial clearance during late erythropoiesis, we then differentiated these cells along the erythroid lineage in vitro using established culture conditions. 28, 29 As with the HeLa cell lines that we described above (Fig. 3A) , 64-105 Atg4D-GFP and DN63-Atg4D-GFP were expressed exclusively in the mitochondria of erythroblasts (Fig. 4A) , and the ultrastructural localization of DN63-Atg4D-GFP was confirmed as being in the mitochondrial matrix by immuno EM (Fig. 4B) .",

This is temporally associated with elevated expression of Atg4D and several other autophagy genes (Betin VMS, Parsons SF, Anstee DJ, Lane JD, manuscript in preparation). To determine whether mitochondrial Atg4D influences the rate and timing of mitophagy during human erythropoiesis, we used EM to count mitochondrial profiles at late stages of erythroid maturation using cells differentiated from the stably transformed erythroid progenitor cells (Fig. 5A) . We found that mitochondrial numbers were already significantly reduced in PCE cells expressing DN63 Atg4D-GFP (PCE control vs. PCE DN63 Atg4D-GFP: p , 0.05; PCE 64-105-GFP vs. PCE DN63 Atg4D-GFP: p , 0.01) ( Fig. 5A ), suggesting that mitophagy may have been initiated sooner in these cells. Thereafter the rates of mitochondrial clearance were very similar between erythroid cells expressing DN63 Atg4D-GFP, those expressing 64-105 Atg4D-GFP, and untransfected (control) erythroblasts (Fig. 5A) . Importantly, no significant differences in the rates of differentiation were observed between control, 64-105 Atg4D-GFP and DN63 Atg4D-GFP expressing erythroid cells (Fig. S2) , although there was a notable increase in cell death in the DN63 Atg4D-GFP expressing populations (data not shown). These observations suggest that the expression of DN63 Atg4D-GFP in differentiating human erythroblasts causes a reduction in mitochondrial content at the PCE stage, without influencing the rate of erythroid differentiation in vitro.",

Mitochondria were often observed having reduced numbers of misshapen/disorganized cristae, or lacking discernable cristae ( Fig. 5B  and C) , at the time when mitochondria were being actively removed by mitophagy (Fig. 5A) . Altered mitochondrial profiles have previously been described in cultured rat reticulocytes and in mouse fibroblasts deficient in prohibitin-mediated OPA1 processing. 31 Importantly, the density and organization of mitochondrial cristae is directly related to the dimeric status of ATP synthase, and thus to the respiratory efficiency of the organelle. 32, 33 Meanwhile, disrupted mitochondrial ultrastructure has been linked with reduced mitochondrial inner membrane fusion and subsequent cell death signaling in pathology. 34, 35 Aberrant cristae ultrastructure can therefore be viewed as a common feature of dysfunctional mitochondria, and may correlate with those mitochondria destined for autophagic removal in the erythroid lineage. Interestingly, in DN63 Atg4D-GFP expressing erythroblasts, changes to crista structure were advanced, with a greater proportion of mitochondria having disorganized cristae at the PCE and orthochromatic stages (Fig. 5C) . Significantly, this is the stage during which we had recorded reduced mitochondrial numbers in DN63 Atg4D-GFP expressing erythroblasts ( Fig. 5A ), suggesting that expression of DN63 Atg4D-GFP alters mitochondrial cristae organization and may be linked to advanced differentiation triggered mitophagy in this system.",

                "text": "One possible consequence of the presence of increased numbers of abnormal mitochondria in late erythroid cells expressing DN63 Atg4D-GFP is an increase in oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species are generated in mitochondria as a normal consequence of oxidative phosphorylation, but their production is greatly enhanced in mitochondria that are inefficient at ATP generation and therefore hold a high protonmotive force (Dp). 36 Mitochondria with reduced densities of cristae are predicted to have a less efficient ATP synthase population, and may consequently generate more ROS. To test whether this is a feature of erythroid cells stably expressing DN63 Atg4D-GFP, we used the mitochondrial ROS reporter, MitoSOX. Late stage erythroblasts (day 8 of differentiation: typically 30% reticulocyte, 70% orthochromatic for each culture condition; Fig. S2 ) were stained with MitoSOX in the absence or presence of antimycin A. At least 400 erythroblasts from two separate cultures (eight individual platelet donors) were imaged using the same exposure settings, with ROS assessed by measuring fluorescence levels in individual cells (Fig. 5D shows data from one culture). Basal MitoSOX fluorescence was significantly increased in cells expressing DN63 Atg4D-GFP ( Fig. 5D ), perhaps linked with the disruption of cristae architecture in these cells. Meanwhile, although there was very little change in MitoSOX fluorescence when control or 64-105 Atg4D-GFP expressing erythrocytes were treated with antimycin A, DN63 Atg4D-GFP erythroblasts showed a significant increase in ROS upon antimycin A treatment (Fig. 5D) . It is unclear why the addition of antimycin A failed to increase ROS levels in control and 64-105 Atg4D-GFP expressing erythroblasts, but this perhaps reflects the differing physiological status of these cells. Overall, these data suggest that overexpression of DN63 Atg4D-GFP within the mitochondria of differentiating human erythroid cells influences mitochondrial structure and physiology, rendering cells more prone to oxidative stress.",

The observation of increased numbers of mitochondria with disordered cristae in differentiating human erythroid cells expressing DN63 Atg4D-GFP ( Fig. 5C ), prompted us to assess the status of mitochondria in HeLa cells stably expressing wild-type or C144A DN63 Atg4D-GFP at the ultrastructural level. We found that wild-type DN63 Atg4D-GFP expressing HeLa cells appeared morphologically normal (when compared with cells expressing 64-105 Atg4D-GFP or C144A DN63 Atg4D-GFP; data not shown): membranes of rough ER, Golgi and autophagosomal origin were observed (including autophagic phagophores), and numerous mitochondria could be clearly identified (Fig. 6A) . The majority of mitochondria in wild-type DN63 Atg4D-GFP expressing cells contained extensive cristae; however, evidence of reduced density of cristae was apparent in many (Fig. 6A) . We therefore measured the total length of cristae in each mitochondrion relative to mitochondrial area, and observed a significant reduction in mitochondrial crista density in wild-type DN63 Atg4D-GFP expressing cells when compared with cells expressing C144A DN63 Atg4D-GFP (Fig. 6B) . These data suggest that in both primary human erythroid cells and cultured HeLa cells, DN63 Atg4D-GFP expression disrupts mitochondrial crista organization (dependent upon Atg4D endopeptidase activity), altering mitochondrial function and rendering cells more susceptible to oxidative stress. One possible reason for changes in the organization/density of mitochondrial cristae is altered process/activity of the inner membrane fusion factor, OPA1. We checked whether OPA1 processing was deficient in DN63 Atg4D-GFP expressing cells by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-OPA1 antibodies; however, ",

In addition to functional redundancy, one plausible explanation for multiple Atg4 family members is that some or all have gained additional functions within cells that may or may not be related to autophagy. 39 This idea is supported by the data that we have reported here, because our results show that Atg4C and Atg4D both contain strong, cryptic mitochondrial import sequences that can change the localization of these proteins from cytosol to mitochondria under certain conditions. Interestingly, each of these Atg4 family members is a caspase substrate, 9,14 and we have mapped the mitochondrial import sequences to stretches of amino acids immediately downstream of the caspase sites in these molecules. This suggests that caspase cleavage may be one mechanism to trigger mitochondrial import of Atg4C and Atg4D (through exposure of import sequences) therefore implicating proteolysis in the regulated import of these Atg4 family members into mitochondria during cellular stress. Importantly, though, our data also show that caspase action is not necessary for mitochondrial Atg4D import, because a subfraction of Atg4D is present within mitochondria at steady-state, and that mitochondrial Atg4D is detected in cells expressing uncleavable Atg4D or those treated with caspase inhibitors. The key questions are: What are the roles of Atg4D and Atg4C within mitochondria, and should these Atg4 family members continue to be considered as true regulators of autophagy? Although we do not attempt to address the latter question in this article, we have made some progress toward understanding the potential mitochondrial roles of Atg4D in cultured cells and primary, differentiating human erythroblasts.",

We also derived primary human CD34 + erythroid precursors stably expressing wild-type mitochondrial Atg4D to explore the potential role of Atg4D during physiological mitophagy. Although HeLa cells expressing mitochondrial Atg4D had apparently normal mitochondrial contents and organization/ dynamics, when treated with the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP, those expressing wild-type DN63 Atg4D were more prone to cell death. This provided some clues as to the possible influence of mitochondrial Atg4D upon mitochondrial function, although expression of DN63 Atg4D did not enhance the susceptibility of HeLa cells to antimycin A, or to the apoptotic inducers anisomycin or staurosporine. Like many transformed cells grown in glucose-rich media, HeLa cells are highly glycolytic, meaning that they rely less on oxidative phosphorylation for generation of ATP. Upon addition of CCCP, the mitochondrial inner membrane becomes highly permeable to protons, effectively disconnecting the electron transport chain from oxidative phosphorylation. Under these conditions, the mitochondrial electron transport chain continues to operate, but heat is generated instead of ATP. Why the presence of mitochondrial DN63 Atg4D influences cell viability in cells treated with CCCP but not with antimycin A (an inhibitor of electron transport and potent ROS inducer) remains unclear. Interestingly, evidence suggests that the activity of several mitochondrial proteases is controlled by mitochondrial bioenergetics. For example, the proteolytic processing and therefore the activities of OPA1 and Pink1 depend on mitochondrial membrane potential, [40] [41] [42] demonstrating how mitochondrial quality pathways are coupled to ATP generation, apoptosis and mitophagy. It is possible, then, that altered mitochondria bioenergetics might influence the activity of mitochondrial Atg4D; however, until any mitochondrial targets for Atg4D are identified, this aspect of Atg4D biology cannot readily be determined. Of note, reduced mitochondrial crista density was observed in HeLa cells expressing wild-type DN63 Atg4D-GFP; although this phenomenon was not associated with altered OPA1 processing.",

We have exploited a human ex vivo erythroid differentiation protocol to test whether expression of mitochondrial Atg4D influences erythroid mitochondrial quality control and cellular differentiation. We were motivated by the suggestion that limited, sublethal caspase action is needed for erythroid differentiation, and by the dramatic upregulation of Atg4D expression observed during erythropoiesis (Betin VMS, Parsons SF, Anstee DJ, Lane JD, manuscript in preparation). Although we have not been able to formally demonstrate the presence of Atg4D within erythroid mitochondria, due to the lack of a suitable antibody for the detection of processed Atg4D, 9 we set out to determine the potential roles of mitochondrial Atg4D during erythropoiesis by lentiviral expression of DN63 Atg4D in primary human erythroblasts. We found that erythroblasts stably expressing DN63 Atg4D differentiated normally, but had substantially decreased mitochondrial populations at the PCE stage. Notably, in common with the data obtained from HeLa cells, the mitochondria within these cells showed evidence of crista disorganization, supporting a role for DN63 Atg4D in mitochondrial organization and/or bioenergetics in physiological cell differentiation systems.",

Indeed, a recent study provided evidence that Nix is needed for mitochondrial depolarization following acute CCCP treatment, and that CCCP-stimulated autophagy required ROS. It is therefore interesting that in human erythroid cells stably expressing DN63 Atg4D, ROS levels were significantly increased, perhaps linked to the increase in the proportion of mitochondria with disorganized cristae and the possible advancement of mitochondrial clearance in these cells.",

Data show that full-length Atg4C and Atg4D have very weak Atg8 priming activities in vitro against multiple Atg8 substrates, 9, 38 suggesting that they may not be functional autophagic regulators. The two available mouse Atg4 knockout models have helped us understand the roles of these family members, as well as providing some clues as to the redundancy that exists within the Atg4 family. The Atg4B knockout mouse is viable, suggesting redundancy, but has dramatically reduced autophagic response in vivo and in vitro. Its primary phenotype is in the development of otoconia and balance pathways, 44 implying that the dampening of autophagy can have profound effects upon certain differentiation pathways. The interpretation of the phenotype of the Atg4C knockout mouse is less clear, particularly in the light of our findings that this protein has the potential to be imported into mitochondria. Atg4C 2/2 mice have mild autophagy phenotypes, largely restricted to the diaphragm, and are more susceptible to fibrosarcoma. 37 Perhaps significantly, Atg4C 2/2 mice display reduced locomotor activity only under starvation conditions when compared with their wild-type littermates. 37 A general decline in animal physiology due to reduced autophagy in the diagram is the suggested explanation; 37 however, it is tempting to speculate that altered mitochondria and disturbed energy homeostasis due to the lack of Atg4C in stressed mice might also contribute. Clearly, more research into the relative functions of Atg4 family members during autophagy and cell stress is needed.",

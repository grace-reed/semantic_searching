A symbiotic Symbiodiniaceae provides its coral host with vital photosynthesis products that can meet up to 95% of the coral's energy requirements; in exchange, the coral host provides inorganic nutrients and serves as shelter (Muscatine and Porter, 1977) for the symbiont. This mutualistic relationship, however, is delicate and susceptible to the environment factors including thermal stress, high light and extreme salinity (Davy et al., 2012; Kuanui et al., 2015; Nielsen et al., 2018; Skirving et al., 2019) . These stress conditions often lead to the expulsion, death, or pigment loss of the Symbiodiniaceae from the host, known as coral bleaching. Global warming and anthropogenic activities have been responsible for massive bleaching and coral degradation, and posed major threats to the precious coral reef ecosystem around the world (Hughes et al., 2017) .",

It has been shown that trace metal deficiency can also induce coral bleaching (Ferrier-Pages et al., 2018) . Trace metals are essential components of electron transport chains or important cofactors for enzymes involved in various biological processes, such as chlorophyll synthesis, nitrate reduction, and photoprotection or photorepair (Twining and Baines, 2013; Andresen et al., 2018) . Marine microalgae acquire trace metals from their ambient environment through the action of metal transporters and in some species by releasing chelating compounds like siderophores or similar machineries to facilitate the uptake (Morel and Price, 2003) . The influence of trace metal availability on phytoplankton is well documented (e.g. Sunda, 2012; Hong et al., 2017) , but its effects on Symbiodiniaceae is rarely investigated, especially at the molecular level. We recently reported that the growth of Fugacium kawagutii was limited by deficiency of antioxidant-associated trace metals in the following order of significance: Fe N Zn N Mn N Cu N Ni (Rodriguez and Ho, 2018) , but the underlying cell metabolism remain undetermined.",

After fragmenting the mRNA molecules using fragmentation buffer, random N6 primer was used in cDNA synthesis. Then double-stranded cDNA (dscDNA) was subjected to end-repair and 3'adenylated. The ligation products were purified and PCR amplified. Lastly the PCR products were denatured by heat and the single strand DNA is cyclized before sequencing on BGISEQ-500 platform. From the raw data, clean reads were obtained by removing low quality reads, reads containing only adapter, and reads containing poly-N in all the experimental samples. Rarefaction curve analysis was conducted to examine if depth of sequencing data was sufficient for genome-wide gene expression profile analysis.",

In search for DEGs involved in photosynthetic electron transfer chain, we found photosystem I reaction center (PSI), ATP synthase (chloroplastic), and ferredoxin were down-regulated under Fe-deficient condition, while cytochrome b 6 f complex, fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a-c binding protein A/F, photosystem II reaction center (PSII) and Rubisco were up-regulated under Fedeficient condition (Fig. 3) . For the cell respiratory system, cytochrome b2 and ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex assembly factor 2 were significantly down-regulated (fold change N2, P b .05, as defined earlier in the paper), and cytochrome c-type heme lyase and ATP synthase (mitochondria) showed less dramatic down-regulation (fold change between 1.5 and 2, P b .05) under Fe-deficient condition (Fig. 3) . Most of these chloroplastic and mitochondrial ETC genes showed no changes in expression under deficiency of one of the other four trace metals, suggesting that ETC was influenced only by iron among the five trace metals examined.",

Under the deficiencies of the five trace metals examined in this study, 372 shared DEGs were regulated and significantly enriched in seven KEEG pathways (Fig. 1A) , indicating that these are likely common response to trace metal stress, some of which might even be general stress response. The present study further indicated that the number of DEGs identified by comparing trace metal deficient cultures and control cultures was the greatest in Fe deficiency, then decreasing in the following order, Fe N Mn N Zn N Cu N Ni (Table 1) . This result is broadly in line with previous report that the demand of F. kawagutii for the trace metals is also the highest for Fe, and decreases in the following order: Fe N Zn N Mn N Cu N Ni (Rodriguez and Ho, 2018) . Thus, the DEG numbers generally reflect the relative importance of individual trace metal to F. kawagutii growth. However, it is of interest to note that Mn was ranked higher than Zn with respect to DEG numbers but lower than Zn with respect to growth demand. This discrepancy suggests that Zn is needed in greater amount but probably can be replaced by other metals whereas Mn is needed in smaller amount but its deficiency induced broader metabolic modification.",

There are two possibilities. First, the majority of genes in F. kawagutii may be regulated translationally or post-translationally. Second, the influence of deficiencies of the 5 trace metals is restricted to a small number of genes and pathways. Based on general dinoflagellate peculiar characteristics, the first possibility is more likely, underscoring the importance of proteomic approach to address complete molecular regulation of stress response in this dinoflagellate in the future.",

In F. kawagutii, PCP, high affinity nitrate transporter, nitrate transporter, Rubisco, fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a-c binding protein were highly and commonly expressed genes in nutrient replete and trace metal deficient conditions. These genes are important in light harvesting and nitrate utilization. And among these genes, PCP has been reported to be highly expressed in at least three dinoflagellate cultures, e.g. Symbiodinium Clade C3, Lingulodinium polyedrum strain 70 and Alexandrium tamarense-EST1 (Lin, 2011) , indicating that dinoflagellates commonly have a high ability of light harvesting and photoprotection. The higher expression of nitrate transporters than ammonium transporter is particularly interesting, because in the genome of this species, NH 4 transporter gene is more abundantly duplicated than NO 3 \u2212 transporter gene (Lin et al., 2015) . The inconsistence suggests that while the species has a high potential of utilizing NH 4 (perhaps when living in symbiotic association with a host), when grown free of host and with NO 3 \u2212 medium, gene expression strongly favors NO 3 \u2212 transporter over NH 4 transporter.",

A recent transcriptome analysis of Symbiodiniacea also revealed differences in expression of fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis pathway genes potentially related to membrane composition and energy storage (Parkinson et al., 2016) . In this study, we found fatty acid synthesis and metabolism was significantly enriched under trace metal deficiencies. And it is worth noting that 3 genes encoding delta fatty acid desaturase enzyme previously reported under thermal stress in Fugacium (Gierz et al., 2017) were found to be up-regulated under trace metal deficiencies (Fig. 3) . Fatty acid desaturases are involved in synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), which are important in the acclimation of microorganisms to various ambient temperatures (Los and Murata, 1998) . This implies the trace metal deficiencies may have similar influence as thermal stress on PUFA synthesis and changing membrane lipid composition may be a common response to ambient stress of Symbiodiniaceae. Most genes associated with membrane composition were regulated by deficiency of trace metals, further confirming the membrane composition was sensitive to change under metal deficiencies. Transmembrane protein 65 and outer membrane protein PmpB, for instance, were found to be up-regulated, and integral membrane protein transmembrane and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 4 were down-regulated. Thus, fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism was significantly regulated by trace metal deficiencies, thermal stress (Gierz et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2019) and light intensity changes (Xiang et al., 2015) , suggesting in concert that the membrane lipid composition of Symbiodiniaceae (even the thermal-resistant strains such as F. kawagutii) is sensitive to environmental stress.",

It has been known that a novel cell adhesion molecule Svep1 (Shefer and Benayahu, 2010) is significantly reduced by increasing or decreasing light density in Symbiodiniaceae SSB01 cells, and this was implicated in influencing the potential of symbiosis (Xiang et al., 2015) . While in the present study, we found that six genes encoding Svep1 were up-regulated under trace metal deficiencies in F. kawagutii. We also found 23 genes encoding the ECM protein, 3 genes encoding cell adhesive plaque matrix protein, 10 genes encoding trophinin and 1 gene encoding P-selectin were up-regulated under trace metal deficiencies. One gene annotated as classical arabinogalactan protein 9-like, which is implicated in diverse developmental roles such as differentiation, cell-cell recognition, cell signaling and programmed cell death (Schultz et al., 2000) , was also upregulated under trace metal deficiencies. In addition, cell wall structure of Symbiodiniaceae was sensitive to light density (Xiang et al., 2015) , exogenous glucose (Xiang et al., 2017) , heat stress (Lin et al., 2019) . In present study, glycine-rich cell wall structural protein-like, cell wall alpha-1,3-glucan synthase mok11/12, vegetative cell wall protein, pollen-specific leucine-rich repeat extensin-like protein 1 and Dalanine:D-alanine ligase (DDI) involved in cell-wall biosynthesis were up-regulated under deficiency of trace metals, suggesting that the cell wall structure can also be influenced by trace metals. Taken together, our data along with the previous data of others suggest that the ability of recognition and cell adhesion in F. kawagutii may be changed by trace metal deficiencies, especially in Fe deficiency. These have implications in the symbiotic relationships of F. kawagutii with corals or other organisms.",

Molecular studies have revealed that iron limitation in phytoplankton upregulates PSII protein abundance (Hong et al., 2017) and impairs the electron transport capacity of PSII (Petrou et al., 2014) . In our study, most DEGs identified in the photosystem were down-regulated under Fe deficiency, indicative of depressed photosynthetic capacity. It has been known that the ferredoxins and other carriers on the reducing side of PSI have sufficiently negative electrochemical potentials to donate electrons to oxygen resulting in the formation of ROS (Arora et al., 2002) . The PSII, Cytochrome b 6 f complex and Cytochrome c-550 were up-regulated, indicating elevation of light harvesting and electron transport, which can potentially promote photorespiration and ROS production, especially given that PSI, ferredoxin and ATP synthase genes were down-regulated. The Mn and Cu are also involved in ETC, but the DEGs associated with ETC were only identified from the Fe-deficient group. And most Mn-or Zn-dependent components were upregulated on Mn-and Zn-deficient group, suggesting that these components probably can use other elements as cofactors when the primary cofactors are deficient (Fig. 2) , making them less essential than Fe.",

We found that ferredoxin gene was down-regulated under iron deficiency as expected, but observed no change in flavodoxin transcription. One possibility is that flavodoxin expression is regulated at translational level rather than transcriptional level, as are many genes in dinoflagellates (Lin, 2011) . Another possibility is that the decrease in ferredoxin expression is compensated by another functional analog, which is unknown. In addition, F. kawagutii has been shown to maintain growth at low iron availability when other trace metals such as manganese, copper or zinc is available (Rodriguez and Ho, 2018) . From the transcriptomic we found the zinc and manganese transporter were down-regulated, while iron permease and ABC transporter A/G/F families were up-regulated under Fe deficiency. This suggests that F. kawagutii is more likely to reduce Fe requirement and enhance Fe uptake to cope with Fe deficiency and maintain growth than replacing Fe with Zn and Mn, unless transporters of these two trace metals are regulated at the post-transcriptional level.",

It is no surprise, therefore, that Fe deficiency caused down-regulation of nir and high affinity nitrate transporter, as accumulated NO 3 \u2212 inside the cells as a result of nir down-regulation would trigger feedback response of the transport system. However, it is interesting to note that ammonia channel, ammonium transporter and urea-proton symporter were up-regulated in the Fe-deficient group. This is evidence that F. kawagutii might be sensing N stress (even though nitrate was supplied at an excess level) as a result of disabled nitrite reduction and that the dinoflagellate species possesses a strategy to shift toward ammonium or urea utilization to reduce Fe requirement and energy cost in N-nutrient assimilation under Fe-deficient condition.",

In plants, ROS are formed by the inevitable leakage of electrons onto O from the electron transport activities of chloroplasts, mitochondria, and plasma membranes or as a byproduct of various metabolic pathways localized in different cellular compartments (Sharma et al., 2012) . Potentially toxic ROS are removed by antioxidant systems including most enzymatic antioxidants such as SOD and metal ions such as ferrous ion. As long as scavenging mechanisms are functional, ROS will not accumulate. Our transcriptomic data indicated that gpx, gst, apx, prx, trx and pi were all down-regulated in Fe-deficient group (Fig. 4) . To make the matter worse, under the iron deficiency, NADP oxidase, cytochrome P450 and citrate synthase, enzymes that can potentially promote ROS production, were upregulated ( Fig. 3) . Thus, Fe deficiency can potentially be a serious oxidative threat to F. kawagutii, in which case oxidative damage will occur, leading to metabolic dysfunction, cell destruction or mutation. None of these ROS scavenging genes was down-regulated under other four trace metal deficiencies, indicating the cell can hold a stable ability of ROS scavenging. In addition, the Fe/Mn-, Mn-and Cu/Zn-dependent SODs showed no differential expression in five metal deficiencies relative to the control. This apparently stable SOD antioxidant enzyme, if verified to be so at protein and activity levels, may serve as rescue mechanism in F. kawagutii cope with oxidative stress caused by Fe limitation and other types of stress. Together, these results suggest that F. kawagutii invests heavily in SOD production, and would have to reallocate Fe toward SOD by reducing synthesis of other Fe-dependent proteins.",

Innate immunity in scleractinian corals plays an important role in the maintenance of coral-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis (Kvennefors et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2017) . It is generally assumed that Symbiodiniaceae actively suppress the coral immune response to allow infection by the symbiont cells and symbiosis establishment. Little literature has described the counter-immunity mechanism of Symbiodiniaceae to sustain healthy symbiosis with corals. In our F. kawagutii transcriptomic data, we found genes putatively involved in immunity and found that most of them was up-regulated under deficiencies of the five trace metals examined here. No gene was found down-regulated under trace metal deficiencies except for Fe deficiency. Among these, 8 genes encoding protein NLRC3, an intracellular sensor that negatively affected innate immune responses (Allen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014) , were downregulated under Fe deficiency. The uptick change of their innate immune under trace metal deficiencies, especially under Fe deficiency, suggests that the deficiency may lead to strengthening of host immunity, and imaginably to the disruption of symbiosis and bleaching. However, this requires further experimental study using coral-Symbiodiniaceae holobionts as the subject.",

DEGs encoding ECM, cell surface structure and cell adhesion protein were up-regulated in five trace metal deficiencies, suggesting that the ability of recognition and adhesion in F. kawagutii may be changed when the trace metal was not available in situ. Comparison of the number of DEGs detected in every treatment group indicated that iron was the most influential metal in F. kawagutii. Under iron deficiency, antioxidant machinery seemed to be weakened and ROS production enhanced, suggesting that oxidative damage will likely occur, leading to metabolic dysfunction, cell destruction or mutation. In addition, our data revealed up-regulation of innate immunity in F. kawagutii, implying a heightened potential of symbiont expulsion and symbiosis breakdown under trace metal deficient conditions, a perspective warranting further experimental inquiry. In summary, trace metal deficiency seems to promote energy metabolism, innate immunity, and cell adhesion and depress growth and the capacity of ROS scavenging, which when occurring to coral symbionts may induce coral bleaching.",

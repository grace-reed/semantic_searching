                "text": "Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conditions are driving unprecedented changes in seawater chemistry, resulting in reduced pH and carbonate ion concentrations in the Earth's oceans. This ocean acidification has negative but variable impacts on individual performance in many marine species. However, little is known about the adaptive capacity of species to respond to an acidified ocean, and, as a result, predictions regarding future ecosystem responses remain incomplete. Here we demonstrate that ocean acidification generates striking patterns of genome-wide selection in purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) cultured under different CO 2 levels. We examined genetic change at 19,493 loci in larvae from seven adult populations cultured under realistic future CO 2 levels. Although larval development and morphology showed little response to elevated CO 2 , we found substantial allelic change in 40 functional classes of proteins involving hundreds of loci. Pronounced genetic changes, including excess amino acid replacements, were detected in all populations and occurred in genes for biomineralization, lipid metabolism, and ion homeostasis-gene classes that build skeletons and interact in pH regulation. Such genetic change represents a neglected and important impact of ocean acidification that may influence populations that show few outward signs of response to acidification. Our results demonstrate the capacity for rapid evolution in the face of ocean acidification and show that standing genetic variation could be a reservoir of resilience to climate change in this coastal upwelling ecosystem. However, effective response to strong natural selection demands large population sizes and may be limited in species impacted by other environmental stressors.",

The negative impacts of ocean acidification have been seen in a broad range of species (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) and are predicted to lead to future populations of individuals with low growth, reproduction, or survival. However, the capacity of marine populations to adapt to these changes is unknown (9, 10) , and, as a result, there may be circumstances in which natural selection could result in populations of individuals with better-than-expected fitness under acidified conditions. Until recently, the tools to scan for standing genetic variation with adaptive potential in the face of climate change have not been broadly available. Here we combine sequencing across the transcriptome of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, growth measurements under experimental acidification, and tests of frequency shifts in 19,493 polymorphisms during development. We detect the widespread occurrence of genetic variation to tolerate ocean acidification.",

The habitat of the purple sea urchin varies across seasons and latitude in CO 2 concentrations and in pH due to the upwelling of cold, high-CO 2 , low-pH waters from the ocean's depths (14) . This large-scale environmental mosaic within the California Current System is likely to be of ancient origin: variable upwelling conditions have existed for millions of years (15) and have led to the evolution of marine taxa dependent on these productive, coldwater conditions (16) . Populations within this upwelling ecosystem are exposed episodically to elevated CO conditions within coastal regions of smaller spatial extent than the dispersal scales of the planktonic larvae of sea urchins (17) , opening the possibility that local selection might promote and sustain alleles with greater fitness in high CO 2 conditions.",

Planktonic larvae were grown in replicate cultures from fertilization until metamorphosis to the benthic, juvenile stage (50 d postfertilization) under ambient (400 \u03bcatm) or elevated (900 \u03bcatm) partial pressures of CO 2 (pCO 2 ; Table S2 ). To quantify effects of CO 2 on growth and development, we measured five morphological features during the transition period from four-to eight-arm larvae. Responses to CO 2 seldom differed among populations (ANOVA, CO 2 \u00d7 population; P > 0.05), so we pooled across localities. Lengths of calcareous skeletal rods ( Fig. 1 A-C) and stomach area ( Fig. 1E ) rarely differed between the two CO 2 levels, although high-CO 2 larvae were consistently 4-5% smaller in body length (Fig. 1D ). Larvae developed at similar or slightly faster rates under high CO 2 (Fig. S1A ), and thus smaller body size was an effect of elevated CO 2 rather than an indicator of delayed development. Moreover, at the completion of the planktonic phase, larvae under both CO levels were equally competent to metamorphose and settle ( Fig. S1B ), indicating no sustained difference in developmental trajectory.",

We sequenced the 28 samples on 28 Illumina lanes (7 populations \u00d7 2 CO 2 levels \u00d7 2 time points in development) to obtain >100 billion base pairs of sequence data, an average of 80 million 50-bp reads for each sample. We mapped reads to all predicted genes from the genome sequence (18) and identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across all samples. We excluded rare alleles (<5% frequency) and filtered for depth of coverage and differences in gene expression in response to CO 2 to minimize the possibility of confounding changes in allele frequency with changes in allele-specific expression (see SI Text and Figs. S2 and S3 for additional analyses, results, and discussion of the small role of allelespecific expression in response to CO 2 in our experiments). This process yielded 19,493 high-quality SNPs.",

The enoyl CoA hydratase (Echs1) protein is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in lipid metabolism (Fig. 2C ). FYVE, RhoGEF and PH domain-containing protein 6 (FGD6) regulates the cytoskeleton and cell shape ( Fig. 2D ), and the glutamate receptor is involved in ion transport ( Fig. 2E ). Four of the 30 genes (significantly more than expected; P < 0.0001; test of percentages) are part of the biomineralization proteome and occur in adult or larval skeletal structures (see below). Other protein functions across the 30 genes include metabolism, cell structure, transcription and translation processes, cell signaling, and stress response (see Table S3 for complete list). We tested for the concentration of greater changes in allele frequency in genes with specific biological functions, an approach known as functional enrichment analysis. We found that genes showing strong allele frequency changes induced by CO were concentrated in 40 of 1,307 functional protein classes (FDR P < 0.10; Table S4 and Figs. 3 and 4) . In response to elevated CO 2 , we expected greater changes in allele frequency to be concentrated in functional categories that improve larval fitness in low-pH conditions (Fig. 3) . Specifically, based on previous studies of physiological response to CO 2 , we hypothesized that genes related to biomineralization, ion homeostasis, and metabolism would show excess genetic change in response to high CO 2 (21) (22) (23) (24) . In contrast, at ambient CO 2 , we expected changes to be random with respect to protein function. In agreement with predictions, the 40 categories enriched for greater than average allele frequency changes in high-CO 2 conditions were primarily related to lipid metabolism, ion homeostasis, cell signaling, and protein modification (Table S4 and Figs. 3 and 4 ). There were 980 unique genes represented across these categories (Table S4 ).",

Again, as predicted, the greatest changes in allele frequency were concentrated in metabolism, particularly lipid metabolism, and ion homeostasis genes (Table S5; (Fig. 5) . rather than random effects, there was a high degree of overlap (71%) in the genes in the enriched functional categories after 1 d at 900 \u03bcatm pCO 2 and after 7 d at 900 \u03bcatm pCO 2 .

These tests parallel studies of human genetic variation that use the fraction of replacement SNPs as a signal of environmental selection (20) . First, we ranked SNPs by the average degree of allele frequency difference between control (average of 400\u03bcatm pCO 2 samples) and treatment (day 7-900 \u03bcatm pCO 2 ) samples. We identified amino acid-changing SNPs across the entire dataset and compared them to amino acid-changing SNPs that occur in the 5% and 1% upper tail of the distribution of ranks (as in ref. 20) . Across our entire dataset, only 10.8% of all SNPs are amino acid replacements. Of these, 25.6% involve charge-changing amino acids most likely to be functionally significant. By contrast, among SNPs with the 5% greatest treatment effects, 14.5% are amino acid-replacing SNPs, with 32.7% changing charge (\u03c7 2 = 8.2; P = 0.004; Fig. S2 ). The 1% tail of the treatment distribution shows 17.3% amino acid-changing SNPs, and 42.9% of these change amino acid charge (\u03c7 2 = 2.7; P = 0.10; Fig. S2 ). The replacement enrichment over the complete dataset (60.2%: 17.3% vs. 10.8%) is similar to that observed in SNPs the human genome that show the greatest association with environmental variables (table 1 in Elevated CO 2 can impact calcification in many marine taxa (4). However, we found the formation of calcareous skeletal rods by larval purple sea urchins to be resilient to elevated CO ( Fig. 1  A-C) . Thus, it is particularly interesting to assay biomineralization genes for experimental CO 2 effects. Because sea urchin biomineralization genes are not included in current Gene Ontology categories, we compiled a list based on the protein components of major skeletal elements (26) and regulatory genes that generate larval skeletons in the primary mesenchyme cells (27, 28) . In total, the list included 350 genes known to be involved in sea urchin skeletal formation, and here we report data on 884 SNPs from these genes.",

Previous ocean-acidification experiments on purple sea urchin and other echinoderm larvae have often found stronger negative effects of CO 2 on growth and development than those documented here (23, 24, 33, 34) . The primary difference between our experimental design and previous studies is that our larval cultures were >10 times less dense, reflecting a more ecologically relevant condition (35) , with perhaps less laboratory-generated stress. We hypothesize that the higher larval densities used in other studies may have interacted with elevated CO to exacerbate the negative effects on developing larvae. At the lower larval densities used in our experiments, effects of elevated CO 2 on purple sea urchin development and morphology appear to be minimal. The most consistent negative response to acidified conditions in our cultures was a 4-5% reduction in body length, which may reflect increased energetic costs of maintenance and skeletal rod formation under elevated CO 2 (24) . However, these minor effects did not influence the timing of settlement or the proportion of larvae that were competent to metamorphose.",

Because we estimate allele frequency from mRNA from pools of larvae, it is conceivable that a change in allele frequency at a given locus is due to a change in allelespecific expression of one haplotype over another. To reduce this potential confounding effect, we excluded the SNPs in the few (23) genes that showed differential expression in response to CO 2 treatment. However, there could also be differences in allelespecific expression in genes with constant transcript abundances. To explore the potential effect of allele-specific expression on our allele-frequency estimates, we compared SNPs from our dataset with SNPs at exactly the same positions using (i) PCR-based allele resequencing for SNPs at two high-treatment-effect loci and (ii) across the genome with Restriction Site Tiling Analysis arrays (36) . Allele frequency estimates were within 0.7% and 1.6% accurate comparing estimates from RNA and DNA in the two high treatment effect loci (Fig. S3) , and we found high correspondence between genome-wide datasets ( Fig. S4A ; R 2 = 0.75; P < 0.0001), suggesting that allele frequencies inferred from RNA-sequencing data were representative of true genomic allele frequencies.",

Significant allele-specific expression at high CO 2 should result in significant shifts in expression value because a chromosome that produces few transcripts of a gene in high CO 2 will reduce the cell-wide abundance of those transcripts (see SI Text for a discussion of potential exceptions). However, only 32 genes across our dataset showed significant expression differences between CO 2 levels, suggesting that the potential for allele-specific expression is limited. We also saw no excess in treatment effect among these 32 differentially expressed genes [unlike a previous study in Drosophila hybrids (37); SI Text]. Lastly, CO 2 treatment had little impact on developmental programming of gene expression because day 1 to 7 expression changes were the same for ambient and high CO 2 levels ( Fig. S4B ; R 2 = 0.92, P < 0.0001) showing that even under conditions of strong gene expression regulation, CO 2 levels have little effect on expression levels, leaving a very small role for CO 2based allele-specific expression.",

Populations experiencing selection pay a selective cost in terms of reduced demographic growth and reproductive potential (12, 47) because individuals that are less fit experience lower growth or survival. Populations impacted by climate change, overfishing, and other anthropogenic impacts may have low population growth and impaired capacity to absorb these selective impacts of acidification. Thus, although marine populations in upwelling systems may possess the capacity for adaptation, maintenance of robust populations in the future is an important part of any climate response strategy. Future studies are needed to empirically test for loss of genetic diversity through rapid evolution in response to ocean acidification.",

Adults were spawned in the laboratory, and for each population gametes were mixed from 10 females and 10 males. Fertilized embryos were cultured under present-day global-mean pCO 2 (partial pressure of CO 2 \u223c400 \u03bcatm) and a fossil-fuel intensive projection (\u223c900 \u03bcatm) (48) . After 24 h, hatched blastulae were transferred to four replicate jars per population and CO 2 level and were maintained at 14\u00b0C in jars with oscillating paddles (SI Text). Seawater was exchanged and sampled for pH and alkalinity, and larvae were fed and sampled every other day during 50-d trials, from 3 d postfertilization to metamorphosis.",

Each of the 28 samples was sequenced on a single Illumina HiSeq lane, yielding \u223c80 million 50-bp reads per sample. Sequence data were processed for length and quality and aligned to all predicted genes of the purple sea urchin (downloaded from www.spbase.org). SNPs were detected and allele frequencies were calculated for each sample at each SNP position as the number of reads with the reference allele divided by the total number of quality reads mapped at that position (see SI Text for more details). A detailed pipeline of all data processing steps and parameters used can be found at http://sfg.stanford.edu (50) . We used permutation analyses to identify outlier polymorphisms and enrichment analyses to identify suites of functionally related genes enriched for high changes in allele frequency (see SI Text for more details).",

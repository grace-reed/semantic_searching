The nature of the relationship is such that these symbiotic algae provide products of photosynthesis to their cnidarian hosts, while the algae are afforded refuge within the endodermal cells of the host. Use of the model system Cassiopea xamachana (a.k.a. the 'upside down jellyfish'), a scyphozoan that can be reared throughout its entire life cycle in a laboratory setting, allowed for the study of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis without many of the constraints involved when working with corals and other cnidarians. The aposymbiotic polyp stage of C. xamachana was used in this study to visualize the acquisition of algal cells by endodermal cells of host animals, a requisite phenomenon for the transition to a free living medusae (strobilation). Polyps harboring algae from environmental sources prior to experimentation were subjected to high temperatures to initiate the expulsion of algae and to obtain polyps that were completely free of symbionts (aposymbiotic); bleaching was confirmed with high resolution confocal microscopy. Aposymbiotic polyps were subsequently introduced to low numbers of Symbiodinium, and the intrinsic growth rate of algae calculated based on count data generated at 7-day intervals. Symbiodinium used for reintroduction in experimental trials were obtained from three sources: (1) commercially cultured algal cells (type A194), (2) algae that had been expelled from their host tissues following heat-induced bleaching in the laboratory, and (3) algae freshly isolated from an adult medusa. These three sources of algal cells were used to represent the possible reservoirs from which bleached animals might replenish their symbiont population following a bleaching event. Symbiodinium cells were acquired by C. xamachana polyps in all three treatment groups, although cultured Symbiodinium A194 exhibited the slowest mean intrinsic growth rate (0.054 d \u22121) once they were housed within endodermal cells of their host. Mean time to strobilation was accordingly slow (> 120 days) for those polyps harboring type A194 symbionts. In fact, polyps harboring other sourced Symbiodinium strobilated in < 70 days on average. Though it is known that strobilation does not occur without the acquisition of symbionts during the polyp stage, the results provided in this study demonstrate clearly that the number of symbionts at the time of strobilation can vary greatly. This variation in symbiont number just prior to strobilation, substantiates previous documented evidence that strobilation is not only stimulated by acquisition of Symbiodinium, but by other triggers as well. Our methods allow quantitative methods to be used to discover additional components involved in the establishment of successful symbiosis between these species.",

                "text": "One of the most well-known symbiotic relationships in the marine environment, is the relationship between cnidarians and endosymbiotic algae of the genus Symbiodinium microadriaticum. Photosynthetic products supplied by the algae help to satisfy the metabolic demands of the host and, in turn, the algae are afforded protection and access to nutrients (Burriesci et al., 2012; Muscatine and Porter, 1977) . The coevolution of cnidarians and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates is of particular interest due to the relatively recent and widespread decline of coral reefs around the globe. Coral reefs, which harbor a substantial fraction of the biodiversity found in marine ecosystems and support https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2018.08.010 T important subsistence fisheries, are being degraded (in many cases) by a phenomenon known as bleaching (Hughes et al., 2003) . Bleaching occurs when Symbiodinium are expelled from host tissues, and typically occurs in response to elevated sea surface temperatures that are result of human-induced climate change (Brown, 1997; Douglas, 2003; Ainsworth et al., 2016; Hughes et al., 2017) . This is a legitimate concern given that reef forming corals devoid of a viable population of symbiotic algae will most likely die (West and Salm, 2003) . Understanding this relationship and the ability of different reservoirs of algal cells to re-colonize symbiotic cnidarians (hermatypic corals, in particular) is a vital step in the conservation of these fragile ecosystems.",

                "text": "Though the protection and conservation of coral reefs is the driving force behind this study of symbiosis, the use of symbiotic corals in laboratory experiments can be problematic due to their protected status, difficult husbandry, and difficulty in viewing cells microscopically. These microscopic limitations of symbiotic corals are typically attributed to the presence of their calcium carbonate skeleton, but challenges can also arise due to large size and irregular morphological contours. As a consequence, other cnidarian host/symbiont relationships are needed to serve as models for corals, with the most common non-coral model species being sea anemones of the genus Aiptasia. Although Aiptasia are easy to maintain in the laboratory and are not considered protected taxa, they have major disadvantages which include difficulties in completing the life cycle and access to early embryos (Grawunder et al., 2015) . Currently, we are developing the upside-down jellyfish (Cassiopea spp.), a scyphozoan that houses Symbiodinium, as a powerful new model for understanding the cellular and molecular aspects of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. The Cassiopea model system has many of the same favorable characteristics as Aiptasia, i.e. Cassiopea are not subject to protected status and are easy to maintain in the laboratory, but also overcomes many of the shortcomings presented by the Aiptasia system. For example, Cassiopea can be easily cultured at all life stages (including embryos) and clonal lines created from asexual budding are readily obtained (Ohdera et al., 2018) . Although Cassiopea is phylogenetically more distant and lacks the calcareous skeleton of scleractinian corals, the advantages of this system (which also include the ability to observe the onset of symbiosis at early life stages) make it an appealing alternative to other symbiotic cnidarian model organisms (Lampert, 2016; Ohdera et al., 2018) .",

                "text": "Like most scyphozoans, Cassiopea reproduce both sexually and asexually. A typical scyphozoan life cycle includes a sexual component and is as follows: fertilization of eggs (which are free of symbionts, i.e. aposymbiotic), release of free-swimming planula larvae, settlement of planulae that metamorphose into a polyp stage, strobilation (constriction of the polyp tentacles to bud immature medusae known as ephyra), and growth of ephyra that transition into mature medusae (Hofmann et al., 1996; Fitt and Costley, 1998; M\u00fcller and Leitz, 2002) . Polyps can also reproduce asexually and create buds which will settle and become new polyps. One unique aspect of the Cassiopea life cycle, however, is the need for polyps to acquire symbionts post-settlement; this step is critical in the development of the jellyfish, because without uptake of symbiotic algae polyps will not metamorphose into ephyra and complete the life cycle (Hofmann et al., 1996) . This distinctive characteristic of the polyp stage in the Cassiopea life cycle affords researchers a unique opportunity to study the establishment process of the symbiotic relationship at the earliest stage, and gain further insight into how algal cells proliferate within host tissues.",

The ability of recently bleached animals to acquire new symbionts was investigated by introducing polyps to Symbiodinium cells from three possible 'environmental reservoirs' likely to allow replenishment of algal populations. Growth of algal populations within host tissues was monitored immediately following uptake until strobilation to determine if a threshold number of Symbiodinium might be necessary to trigger a continuation of the scyphozoan life cycle. Previous research suggests that the number of symbionts is not likely the sole trigger of strobilation (Hofmann and Kremer, 1981; Hofmann et al., 1996) , and that type (or source) of Symbiodinium has a greater influence on this metamorphosis. Attaining a better grasp on how symbiotic cnidarians are interacting with their algal partners, is an important step in determining how these animals (and other cnidarians) might recover from a bleaching event. This study aims to provide a fuller understanding of the relationship between Symbiodinium and C. xamachana, a cnidarian that is becoming more attractive for use as a model organism. Recognizing how different types of Symbiodinium grow within the tissues of a host animal, has important implications for recovery following a bleaching event. In addition to using C. xamachana as a tool to model the cnidarian-algal symbiosis, this study aims to learn more about the major life cycle change seen in this animal (strobilation). Finally, new methods are developed to quantify growth rates of symbiotic algal cells that pave the way for future studies focused on discovering additional effectors regulating the strobilation process.",

As a consequence, we were afforded ready access to an abundant supply of polyps. We originally collected adult C. xamachana from the Florida Keys, transported them to the Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience in St. Augustine, FL, and maintained them at 25\u00b0C in large volume aquaria with a flow through seawater system. Planula larvae released from the brooding tentacles of captive female medusae were allowed to settle on the walls of aquaria where they ultimately metamorphosed into polyps. Collected polyps were subsequently subjected to a heat-induced bleaching protocol (see below) and then housed in six-welled plates filled with 0.2\u03bcm filtered sea water at 25\u00b0C on a 13:11 light cycle. Some polyps selected for bleaching were in the process of producing asexual buds (that were ready for release), though these buds were gently removed before bleaching to allow for settlement and subsequent growth under the imposed laboratory conditions. Polyps were fed 20 \u03bcL of a dense suspension of Artemia nauplii three times weekly; Artemia not consumed by polyps were removed after 24 h.",

Heat-induced bleaching of C. xamachana polyps was achieved by exposing individual polyps (housed inside 2-mL snap cap PCR tubes) to 35.5\u00b0C for two weeks on a 13:11 light cycle; during that time polyps were denied access to food. After two weeks at 35.5\u00b0C, polyps were examined microscopically to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. A dissecting microscope was used in the initial assessment to visualize color changes, as bleached animals are notably lighter in coloration than pigmented, non-bleached animals. Visibly bleached polyps were further examined with a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope. Confocal microscopy allowed for an unambiguous determination of the presence or absence of Symbiodinium in Z-stacks via autofluorescence of chlorophyll at 647 nm. Polyps that were not completely free of symbionts were subjected to 35.5\u00b0C for an additional week and then reexamined to ensure complete expulsion of algal symbionts. Polyps were allowed a one week recovery period following the bleaching protocol at which time their aposymbiotic status was verified via confocal microscopy. Aposymbiotic polyps were then transferred to six-welled plates for experimentation.",

Non-consumed food and algal cells were removed from the wells within 24 h of exposure. Polyps exposed to symbionts were separated into three treatment groups, with each group (n = 10 polyps) being inoculated with algal cells from different sources. Sources were as follows: (1) commercially cultured algal cells; Clade A Symbiodinium microadriaticum type A194 (strain distinction established from the chloroplast 23S rDNA region, internal transcribed spacer type A1) (Santos et al., 2003; Thornhill et al., 2006) , (2) algae that had been expelled following induced bleaching in the laboratory, and (3) algal cells that were freshly isolated from an adult medusa. Freshly isolated algal cells were extracted from an adult medusa after cutting small pieces of tissues from its oral arms. Collected sections of cut tissue were homogenized using a tissue grinder and the resulting homogenate was poured through a 100\u03bcm cell strainer to reduce the amount of residual oral arm tissue (though residual tissue was not completely eliminated). 200 \u03bcL of the filtered isolate was then introduced to aposymbiotic polyps for colonization. Algal cells from bleached animals were obtained by collecting seawater from 2-mL microcentrifuge tubes that contained a subset of polyps during the first 24 h of brief bleaching sessions at 35.5\u00b0C; 200 \u03bcL of this suspension was subsequently introduced to each of 10 wells housing aposymbiotic polyps. Clade of Symbiodinium was not determined by molecular methods for freshly isolated cells or bleached algal cells, though it has been shown that C. xamachana from the Florida Keys typically display a specificity for Clade A1 (Thornhill et al., 2006) . The cultured Symbiodinium used for one treatment group, Clade A type A194, was originally isolated from C. xamachana and housed at the University of Buffalo and maintained as a part of the BURR culture collection. Symbiodinium culture A194 was maintained in the laboratory in F/2 medium on a 13:11 light cycle. 200 \u03bcL of the culture was introduced to each of 10 wells housing aposymbiotic polyps. Because exposing bleached polyps to a low number of symbionts was the objective, the exact number of algal cells in the inoculum was not quantified. Individual polyps within each of the treatment groups were exposed to algal cells for only 24 h, as low numbers of acquired algae at the beginning of the experiment facilitated tracking and counting of algal cells.",

Following exposure to high temperatures, the previously colonized polyps lacked the pigmentation characteristic of algal symbionts (Fig. 1D ) and no autofluorescent signature was detected (Fig. 1E ). Complete expulsion of algae was further verified via confocal microscopy (Fig. 1F ). Recently bleached polyps in each of the three treatments successfully acquired symbionts from their surrounding environment with the number of algal cells initially taken in by individual polyps ranging from 2 to > 100 cells (Fig. 2) . However, the majority of polyps acquired < 20 algal cells during the 24 h exposure period. All forms of algal isolates maintained the ability to colonize newly aposymbiotic polyps (Fig. 3) , with Symbiodinium type A194 (treatment group 1) and freshly isolated algae (treatment group 3) having success at forming and maintaining a stable symbiosis in all cases of recolonization ( Fig. 2A, C) . In contrast, only 70% of the polyps inoculated with algal cells acquired from recently bleached animals (treatment group 2) were able to maintain a stable symbiosis. Although three polyps in treatment group 2 (i.e. 2.2, 2.5, and 2.9) were able to initially take in algal cells, as documented via microscopy, no division of algal cells was observed after the initial acquisition period and prior to expulsion, and in each of these three cases, polyps remained aposymbiotic for the duration of the study (Fig. 2B) . These three polyps from treatment group 2 that did not form a stable symbiosis did not strobilate and transition into ephyra. This is consistent with our laboratory observations that bleached polyps that are not introduced to a new population of symbionts will remain aposymbiotic indefinitely and do not have the ability to strobilate. A final laboratory observation includes the rate of asexual budding seen in recolonized polyps. Feeding regimes with Artemia and access to a normal light cycle did allow for polyps to asexually reproduce via budding, though this was not quantified for each polyp. Budding was not observed to have an impact on growth rate of Symbiodinium within the polyp or overall time to strobilation within groups.",

Past research has shown, for example, that Symbiodinium that are expelled from hosts after stress are less viable. Moreover, viability is markedly reduced as exposure period is increased (Hill and Ralph, 2007) . The condition of algal cells following bleaching is critical because expelled cells are thought to replenish the environment with algal cells that can grow and divide with the potential to repopulate cnidarian hosts (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 1987; Hill and Ralph, 2007; Sammarco and Strychar, 2013) . We observed that symbionts expelled in response to the heat bleaching protocol imposed as part of this work were typically viable at 35.5\u00b0C up to 24 h after exposure. However, as indicated above, not all of the reacquired algal cells were able to form a stable symbiosis. For polyps 2.2, 2.5, and 2.9, colonization was initially Fig. 4 . Data Analysis. A.

The false colonization status of these three polyps was most likely the result of their engulfing an assortment of particles from the water column during feeding, including degraded Symbiodinium. It has been demonstrated previously that nonviable Symbiodinium cells are recognized by the innate immune system of the animal and removed (Davy et al., 2012; Colley and Trench, 1983) . Our findings indicate that algal cells expelled during a simulated 'bleaching' event represent a viable population of Symbiodinium, and have the ability to repopulate cnidarian hosts and may promote host recovery. Higher than normal temperatures can also have harmful effects on free-living populations of Symbiodinium, which are considered to be an important reservoir of algal cells that can populate a symbiotic cnidarian host following a bleaching event (Coffroth et al., 2006; Pochon et al., 2010) . The cultured algae (type A194) used in these experiments to represent a free-living population of Symbiodinium were also seen to be viable and capable of repopulating a cnidarian host and allowing recovery.",

Colley and Trench (1983) reported similarly high rates of uptake of freshly isolated algae by C. xamachana polyps, a finding that was attributed to the fact that cellular membranes surrounding the algae might be readily detected by polyps during colonization. These membranes originate from the host tissues (still surrounding the algae after isolation) and contact with cell membranes of endodermal cells of the C. xamachana hosts in which they were being introduced to led to increased uptake. Regardless, the initial colonized densities of algae did not seem to impact either population growth rates or time to strobilation. We note also that our findings indicate that algae from a variety of sources can colonize and repopulate bleached cnidarians. Symbiodinium from each of the three reservoirs were able to establish a stable symbiosis (with the exception of three polyps in group 2), and allow the hosts to recover and continue through the life cycle.",

In a repopulation experiment carried out by Berner et al. (1993) , aposymbiotic A. pulchella polyps were colonized with a cultured Symbiodinium type homologous to anemone hosts and algal cells isolated from symbiotic A. pulchella anemones. Growth rates of algae in that study were between 7 and 15 days. The rate of division in other symbiotic cnidarians is known to vary greatly, with some of the highest doubling times being > 70 days (Wilkerson et al., 1988; Muscatine et al., 1984) . In a study conducted by Wilkerson et al. (1983) , it was determined that algal cells have higher growth rates in hosts that are exposed to higher nutrient concentrations (between 7 and 11 days) than hosts in nutrient-poor conditions (between 42 and 53 days). In separate studies involving scleractinian corals, doubling times ranged from 3 to 5 days for Eusmilia fastigiata and Dendrogyra cylindrus whereas doubling times for Stylophora pistillata ranged from 53 to 73 days depending on light availability (Wilkerson et al., 1988; Muscatine et al., 1984) . However, these growth rates were representative of standing populations of Symbiodinium in these cnidarian hosts, and could vary slightly from algal growth rates seen in C. xamachana polyps recolonized with Symbiodinium cells (as presented in this study). Longer algal cell division times in situ contrast markedly with doubling times of Symbiodinium in culture (Davy et al., 2012) . The doubling rate of Symbiodinium in culture is between 1 and 3 days, due to algal cells having direct access to needed nutrients and abundant light for growth (Fitt and Trench, 1983; D'Elia and Domotor, 1984; Chang et al., 1983) .",

                "text": "Though it is well known that uptake and retention of algae by polyps is a precursor to strobilation, many studies involving the metamorphosis of Cassiopea spp. polyps have determined that other factors along with the acquisition of symbiotic algae are necessary. Hofmann and Kremer (1981) completed a study in which the photosynthetic activity of the algae was decreased using both DCMU (a known inhibitor of photosynthesis) and extended periods in darkness. Both methods used to diminish photosynthetic activity did not preclude polyps from strobilating and forming ephyra. Strobilation was determined, however, to be enhanced for those polyps that maintained at least a small quantity of algae showing a greater ability to strobilate when exposed to adequate light. This suggests that products of photosynthesis transferred to the host (glucose and glycerol, in particular) do not serve as the sole triggers for strobilation, rather compounds that are created and released independent of photosynthesis contribute greatly to the initiation of strobilation. Other studies involving C. andromeda and Mastigias papus, showed that temperature played a significant role in strobilation, with symbiotic polyps maintained at temperatures between 21 and 25\u00b0C strobilating at much higher rates than polyps kept at temperatures between 17 and 20\u00b0C (Rahat and Adar, 1980; Sugiura, 1965; Hofmann et al., 1996) . Similar to these studies, the research presented here on proliferation of Symbiodinium in previously bleached C. xamachana polyps gives weight to the hypothesis that strobilation is not merely triggered by the complement of algal cells in host tissues. Polyps in our study strobilated with fewer than 3000 algal cells while others did not strobilate until they harbored upwards of 20,000 cells. Here, intrinsic growth rate and time to strobilation could be impacted by type of Symbiodinium cells, although this is less than likely as all types presented were known to be homologous to C. xamachana; cultured Symbiodinium A194 was shown in previous studies to be the type of Symbiodinium preferred by C. xamachana polyps (Mellas et al., 2014) , and algal cells from the other two experimental treatment groups (bleached and freshly isolated) were obtained directly from C. xamachana polyps and a medusa already harboring Symbiodinium. Since temperature and light were kept constant for all polyps in this study, it can be assumed that another factor is involved in strobilation of polyps. Further experiments should look to vary the number of algal cells in the endoderm of C. xamachana polyps along with changes in other abiotic factors, such as temperature, to obtain a better understanding of the processes underlying strobilation.",

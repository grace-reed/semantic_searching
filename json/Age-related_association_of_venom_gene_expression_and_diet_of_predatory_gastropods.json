    "abstract": "Background: Venomous organisms serve as wonderful systems to study the evolution and expression of genes that are directly associated with prey capture. To evaluate the relationship between venom gene expression and prey utilization, we examined these features among individuals of different ages of the venomous, worm-eating marine snail Conus ebraeus. We determined expression levels of six genes that encode venom components, used a DNA-based approach to evaluate the identity of prey items, and compared patterns of venom gene expression and dietary specialization. Results: C. ebraeus exhibits two major shifts in diet with age-an initial transition from a relatively broad dietary breadth to a narrower one and then a return to a broader diet. Venom gene expression patterns also change with growth. All six venom genes are up-regulated in small individuals, down-regulated in medium-sized individuals, and then either up-regulated or continued to be down-regulated in members of the largest size class. Venom gene expression is not significantly different among individuals consuming different types of prey, but instead is coupled and slightly delayed with shifts in prey diversity. Conclusion: These results imply that changes in gene expression contribute to intraspecific variation of venom composition and that gene expression patterns respond to changes in the diversity of food resources during different growth stages.",

Gill rakers of alewives [1] , drilling behavior of marine snails [2] , venoms of snakes [3] [4] [5] and beaks of Darwin's finches [6] all exhibit specific phenotypes that correspond to particular resources. But the genetic mechanisms underlying these phenotypic changes are mostly unknown. In addition to non-synonymous mutations, gene regulation also influences phenotypic changes. Expression of genes that contribute to the ability to consume particular resources is often regulated by characteristics of the resources [7, 8] . For example, for groups of mice that are fed with the same food items as those consumed by human and chimp, levels of differential expression in liver tissues of these mice are comparable to levels of differential expression between liver tissues of human and chimp [9] . This indicates that dietary changes exert more influence on gene expression than the inherent regulating mechanisms among species. To understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the dynamics of predator-prey interactions, it is essential to evaluate the effect of diets on expression of genes that are directly involved in resource utilization.",

Predatory marine snails of the family Conidae ('cone snails') exhibit particular dietary changes that are associated with increase in body size [11, 12] , and many venom genes used for predation have already been well characterized [13, 14] . Leviten [11] suggested that diets of vermivorous Conus species shift from being trophic specialists as juveniles, to generalists as subadults, and then to specialists as adults. Characters associated with predation also exhibit vast changes during development. For example, radular teeth of Conus magus that are used to inject venom into prey, are morphologically distinct in juvenile and adult stages that specialize on polychaetes and fish respectively [15] [16] [17] . Cone snails use venom, a cocktail of numerous compounds including conotoxins, to capture prey and, for some species, to defend against predators [13, 18] . Conotoxins genes undergo extensive gene duplication and rapid evolution [19, 20] , and their expression patterns are highly divergent among species [21] [22] [23] . Similar to the changes of radula teeth through development, the quantity and diversity of conotoxins may change with growth, but no prior study has tested this hypothesis.",

Expression levels of the \u03b2-tubulin gene, a 'house-keeping' gene, should be stable regardless of cells, tissue or developmental stages [41] . We added Tris-EDTA buffer to each cDNA preparation to a total volume of 175 \u03bcL and aliquoted an equal volume of cDNA samples for each qPCR run. We used SYBR Green chemistry to detect and quantify amplified products. All qPCR runs were performed on an ABI Prism 7500 machine at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry's Molecular Biology Core Laboratory. To reduce the effect of noise associated with measurements, each round of qPCR was performed on three replicates for each individual; we used average results of the three replicates as estimates of expression levels. The amplification procedure included ten minutes of initial denaturing at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of amplification: denaturing at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 54\u00b0C or 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 35 s in which fluorescent signals were collected. The annealing temperature of the \u03b2-tubulin locus and four conotoxin genes was 54\u00b0C; for conotoxin loci E1 and ED4, the annealing temperature was 60\u00b0C. We added a dissociation stage (95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and 95\u00b0C for 15 s for each sample) at the end of each run to evaluate the specificity of amplifications. The dissociation stage measures temperatures at which amplified products re-nature. Multiple temperatures of renaturation imply the presence of multiple unique DNA fragments and non-specific amplification. To ensure similarity in efficiency of primers of conotoxin genes with primers of the \u03b2-tubulin gene, we made 1/5 and 1/25 dilutions of cDNA samples of 12 individuals, and compared efficiencies of these primers following the approach described by Schmittgen and Livak [42] .",

To simplify the calculation, we converted 'undetermined' results to 40 (i.e., the last PCR cycle). We estimated \u0394C T values of each conotoxin gene relative to the endogenous gene of each individual by subtracting average C T values of conotoxin genes among three replicates with that of the \u03b2-tubulin gene, and calculated relative expression levels of conotoxin genes with the formula 2 \u2212\u0394C T .",

                "text": "The observed patterns of changes in prey utilization with growth may be affected by three factors: competition and associated microhabitat differentiation, different body volume and energy efficiency of prey types, or minimization of predation risk. Intraspecific competition among congeners of different sizes, as well as interspecific competition at a particular growth stage, often reduce niche overlap and promote resource partitioning within an age-structured population [11, [47] [48] [49] [50] . In addition, body size of predators determines the size of prey that is consumed [47, 48, 51, 52] . Cone snails engulf prey entirely, and therefore consuming prey that are larger than their handling capacity is costly [11] . Among prey items of C. ebraeus at Guam, members of the family Eunicidae typically exhibit the largest body sizes, followed by Nereididae and Syllidae [53] , and these families of polychaetes are coincidently targeted by large, medium and small-sized cone snails as observed here. Moreover, prey handling time is usually shorter than searching time for many Conus species [11] , and therefore small C. ebraeus may expand their dietary spectra to minimize their exposure to predation while searching for food. Intrinsic factors associated with predation efficiency, such as the development of radular teeth and venom potency, may also affect a predator's ability to subdue certain types of prey [15, 17] . The significantly positive association between conotoxin gene expression and dietary diversity implies that prey diversity may exert pressure on conotoxin gene transcription. Intraspecific heterogeneity in venom composition has been suggested to represent local adaptation to different prey utilizing patterns among populations of snakes [3, 54] . But other studies contend that differences in venom composition among populations of snakes are unlikely to be driven by selection that derives from differences in predator-prey relationships, because few prey can escape envenomation and develop heritable resistance [55] [56] [57] . We postulate that high concentration and diversity of venom components within a single population may be beneficial to capturing a more diverse array of prey. Here we assume that mRNA quantities of conotoxin genes are positively correlated with the quantities of peptides, which holds true for venom genes of snakes [58] [59] [60] but has not been tested in cone snails.",

                "text": "Changes in conotoxin gene expression patterns exhibit a short delay relative to shifts in diet with growth, which suggests a potentially adaptive relationship between these two features. Environment-induced phenotypic and physiological variation often exhibits some delay relative to the environmental changes [67] [68] [69] [70] , and such a phenotypic change is advantageous when the delay is small [70] . The induced variation in phenotypes and physiology may result from transcription regulation [71] [72] [73] [74] , and the timing of gene regulation induced by environmental changes is different for genes affected. For example, increases in expression of heat-shock protein genes in yeasts occur almost immediately after heat exposure, but changes in expression of other genes occur some time after the exposure [72] . Therefore, conotoxin gene regulation may be facultatively induced by changes in dietary diversity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that shifts in conotoxin gene expression represent a systematic process rather than one that is plastic with regards to changes in prey, nor the possibility that some of these conotoxin genes are used for defense rather than predation [18] . Moreover, the difference in timing of changes of conotoxin gene expression and diets is difficult to be quantified precisely. Frank [75] found that growth rates of C. miliaris exhibit a logarithmic relationship with shell lengths; during the first year of growth, shell length (up to 15 mm) is a linear approximation of growth rate. The lead of dietary shifts over changes of conotoxin gene expression reported here (the growth time of 1-2 mm in shell lengths) represents about 25 to 50 days of growth time if we assume growth rates of C. ebraeus and C. miliaris are similar. Nonetheless, increases in shell sizes of cone snail species can be abrupt and likely to be related to recent feeding bouts (personal communication by Alan Kohn). Therefore the difference in timing of dietary shifts and conotoxin gene regulation may be negligible.",

Because our sampling was performed at a specific time period, our data do not depict the seasonality in prey availability and prey choice. Moreover, we used a single gene, \u03b2-tubulin, as the endogenous control to quantify conotoxin gene expression under the assumption that expression levels of this gene are consistent among individuals [41] . If this assumption were not true, estimates of changes in conotoxin gene expression may be confounded by fluctuations in expression of the \u03b2-tubulin gene. Though levels of conotoxin gene expression are not significantly different among individuals that consumed different prey species, the limited number of individuals with known diets and conotoxin gene expression levels (i.e., N = 35) may reduce our power to detect an association, if any. In addition, age estimation of these individuals was solely based on shell lengths, variation of which within and among age classes may introduce noise in the real age-related patterns of changes in dietary specialization and venom gene expression. Experimental manipulation of predator-prey interactions and investigation of regulatory mechanisms of conotoxin genes may reveal more information about the evolution of venom gene expression in response to changes in prey specialization.",

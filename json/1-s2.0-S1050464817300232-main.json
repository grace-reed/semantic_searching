In this study, we demonstrated that turbot serum, but not the heat-inactivated control, significantly reduced the number of Edwardsiella tarda (E. tarda). By conjugating serum proteins with fluorescent dyes, we showed that E. tarda were coated with multiple fish proteins. In order to identify these proteins, we used E. tarda to capture turbot serum proteins and subjected the samples to shotgun proteomic analysis. A total of 76 fish proteins were identified in high confidence, including known antimicrobial proteins such as immunoglobins and complement components. 34 proteins with no previously known immunological functions were also identified. The expression of one of these proteins, IQ motif containing H (IQCH), was exclusively in fish brain and gonads and was induced during bacterial infection. This approach also allowed the study of the corresponding proteomic changes in E. tarda exposed to turbot serum, which is a general decrease of bacterial protein expression except for an upregulation of membrane components after serum treatment. Interestingly, while most other known stresses stimulate bacterial antioxidant enzymes, fish serum induced a rapid suppression of antioxidant proteins and led to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Heat treatment of fish serum eliminated this effect, suggesting that heat labile factors in the fish serum overrode bacterial antioxidant defenses. Taken together, this work offers a comprehensive view of the interactions between fish serum proteins and bacteria, and reveals previously unknown factors and mechanisms in fish innate immunity.",

                "text": "Fishery is one of the fastest growing food-producing industries and provides nearly 50% of all culinary fish [1] . Fish diseases caused by bacterial infection poise a significant threat to the economy and human health [2] . A better understanding of the host defense mechanisms will improve the treatment and prevention of these diseases, and may inspire the development of new antibacterial therapeutics [3] . Unlike high vertebrates, fish rely on their innate immune system as the main line of defense [4] . Fish usually get injured by rubbing on rocks and coral, and during capturing and shipping. This kind of injuries can increase the potential entry of pathogens [5, 6] , which trigger the host defense via antibacterial peptides and proteins. In fish innate immunity, the skin and gill are generally regarded as the first line of defense against pathogens because of the anatomical location of these organs. Blood also contains antibacterial peptides and proteins which are indispensable in early innate immune response [4] . These factors in fish serum include lysozyme, lectins, pentraxins and complement components [7, 8] . Previous studies reported that antimicrobial proteins and peptides like lysozyme and lectins can kill bacteria by inducing pore formation [7] . However, pore formation is not the only mechanism of bacteria killing [9, 10] . Immune proteins can enter bacterial cells and bind to intracellular targets, resulting in the inhibition of molecular synthesis and enzymatic activities linked to cell wall integrity [11, 12] . Some studies reported that the cytotoxicity is caused by the simultaneous depletion of intracellular thiols and induction of metal concentrations, resulting in an oxidative stress [13] . However, the molecular origins of these responses in serum-treated bacteria are not clear. As there has not been a systematic characterization of the interactions between fish serum components and bacteria, the molecular mechanism of serum-mediated bacterial killing is not fully understood.",

                "text": "Marine fish, as exemplified in Medaka (Oryzias melastigma), typically contain more than 1800 proteins involved in innate immunity. The functions of these proteins were postulated mainly based on the homology of their nucleotide sequences with known mammalian immune proteins [14] . Further evidence on the antibacterial roles of these proteins is often limited to their enhanced expression after bacterial challenge [15e17] . However, these techniques seldom led to the discovery of previously unknown immune proteins. Recently, proteomic techniques have been applied to discover bacteria-binding serum proteins, which are likely to be functionally related to antibacterial activities. For example, a proteomic approach was used to identify human plasma factors that bind to Streptococcus pyogenes [18] . By combining a similar affinity-based approach with subcellular fractionation, interactions between shrimp serum proteins and the outer membrane of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were characterized [19] . However, this approach is still relatively rare and has not been applied to fish.",

While the molecular mechanism of MAC formation is well studied, the biochemical and physiological consequences in the bacteria in the wake of MAC assembly are poorly understood [10] . Furthermore, most studies have focused on the impacts of purified preparations of complement components or cytotoxic compounds, and the combined effects of the whole serum on the protein expression of bacteria are seldom addressed. This research gap triggered us to investigate the effect of serum treatment on bacteria. The use of live E. tarda bacteria to affinity purify bacteria-binding serum proteins allowed us to examine the change in the bacterial proteome, from the same MS data, during the initial phase of serum exposure. The results of this study provide a unique molecular overview of the interplay between the fish innate immune proteins and the bacterial proteome.",

As shown in Fig. 1A , turbot serum shows an antibacterial effect on all three species. Heat inactivation significantly reduced, but did not completely abolish, the cytotoxicity of turbot serum. We further tested the temporal effect of turbot serum on E. tarda (Fig. 1B) . The number of E. tarda cells steadily decreased over time, reaching about 40% of the starting cell number after 4 h of incubation. Interestingly, heat inactivated serum suppressed the growth in bacterial population but did not induce a decrease in cell number. This suggests that turbot serum possessed heat labile factors that can kill bacteria, while heat resistant factors in the serum can block bacterial proliferation. This observation is consistent with previous studies [21, 22] . We confirmed the cell-killing effect of turbot serum by using a fluorescent viability dye (Fig. 1C ). Scanning electron microscopy indicated that E. tarda treated with turbot serum, but not those treated with culture medium and heat-inactivated serum, developed pores on their cell walls ( Fig. 1D ).",

We performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) on turbot serum, E. tarda cells and serum-treated E. tarda (Fig. 2AeC) . When compared to untreated bacteria (Fig. 2B ), the 2D gel of serumtreated bacteria (Fig. 2C ) contained a large number of additional protein spots, presumably from the binding of turbot serum proteins to the bacteria. None of these additional protein spots corresponded to the abundant proteins in the 2D gel of crude turbot serum ( Fig. 2A ), suggesting that the bacteria-binding proteins represent a specific subset of proteins in the serum, rather than just the adhesion of abundant serum proteins in bacterial surface. To confirm that these proteins originated from fish serum and were not a result of the up-regulation of endogenous bacterial proteins, we covalently conjugated turbot serum proteins with a fluorescent dye and used the labeled proteins to treat bacteria. As shown in Fig. 2D , E. tarda incubated with the labeled serum were fluorescently decorated, suggesting the binding of serum proteins to the bacterial cells. A gel electrophoretic analysis of the treated cells ( Fig. 2E ) indicated the presence of multiple fluorescent protein species associated with the serum incubated E. tarda. Taken together, these data indicate the presence of a large number of bacteria binding proteins in turbot serum, and live E. tarda cells can be used to affinity-purify these proteins.",

E. tarda cells with incubated with turbot serum. After rinsing away the unbound proteins, the entire serum-bacteria complex was lysed, and the released proteins were processed for MS analysis. MS/MS peak lists were interrogated against an in-house combined database that contains turbot and E. tarda genomes, which allows the identification of proteins from both species in the sample. A total of 228 turbot proteins were identified in at least one of the three technical repeats. After excluding fish proteins that were identified in only one of the repeats from further analyses, we obtained a list of 76 proteins (Table S1 ) that we define as bacteriabinding proteins in turbot serum. Western blotting confirmed the binding of one of these proteins, ceruloplasmin, to E. tarda cells (Fig. S2) . A gene ontology analysis reveals that 47 (62%) of these proteins have known immune-related functions, including eight complement components, three immunoglobulins and seven coagulation factors (Fig. 3A) . The detection of these proteins confirms the validity of our experimental approach. The remaining 29 proteins have no previously known immune or antimicrobial functions. These proteins are mainly involved in translation, DNA repair and metal binding (Fig. 3A) . Among these non-immune proteins, 49% are classified as serum or secreted proteins, consistent with the serum origin of the sample (Fig. 3B) . The identified bacteria-binding proteins do not significantly differ in size and charge from the general turbot proteome ( Fig. 3C ), suggesting that their binding to E. tarda cells were not likely associated with physical properties such as size or electrostatic characteristics. Fig. 3D and E shows the known interactions among the human orthologues of the identified proteins. 35% of the orthologues are known bacteria-binding proteins. The largest protein complex bound to E. tarda is involved in wound healing (Fig. 3E ). Two other complexes, for complement activation and oxygen transport, were also identified ( Fig. 3C and D) . 48% of the detected proteins do not have known interaction partners, possibly because these proteins are relatively less well-characterized. Our study thus allows the generation of hypotheses for the further investigations of these proteins.",

We confirmed that the expression of IQCH is highly tissue-specific in zebrafish, restricted to brain, testis and ovary ( Fig. 4A ). Our proteomic data indicated that IQCH in turbot bound to E. tarda cells and implicated a function of this protein in bacterial infection. To ask whether the expression of this protein is increased during bacterial infection, we injected medaka with E. Tarda bacteria and detected IQCH RNA in the testis 12, 24 and 48 h later.

This suggests the existence of some active responses by the bacteria against the stresses. Our data, however, indicate that these pathways were suppressed by turbot serum. Hence, the combined activities of the components in turbot serum led to a proteomic consequence in bacteria that is distinct from all the previously studied growth-inhibitory factors. In particular, proteins involved in antioxidant defense were strongly reduced as early as 5 min after serum treatment (Fig. 5C ). For example, the abundance of a peptide derived from catalase, one of the major ROS scavengers in bacteria [25] , was significantly reduced after turbot serum incubation ( Fig. 5D and E).",

Interestingly, the effect of serum on the expression level of catalase was eliminated by a prior heating of the serum at 56 C for 30 min, suggesting that the suppression of catalase expression was mediated by heat labile, possibly protein factors. The suppression of ROS scavengers may lead to an accumulation of intracellular ROS in serum-treated bacteria. As shown in Fig. 6C , turbot serum was found to induce more ROS in bacteria. The level of ROS in serumtreated bacteria was even higher than in bacteria treated with 5 mM H 2 O 2 . This result indicates that turbot serum can induce endogenous ROS. Taken together, we demonstrated that exposure of turbot serum caused a suppression of catalase in E. tarda bacteria at RNA, protein and functional levels, probably contributing to the accumulation of ROS in serum-treated bacteria.

This was made possible by a simple, single-pot approach of capturing bacteria-binding serum proteins by using live bacteria cells. We have identified 76 bacteria-binding proteins in turbot serum with high confidence. More than 60% of them are known bacteria-binding proteins, such as apolipoprotein E, blood clotting factors like coagulation factors and fibrinogens, oxygen transport related proteins like hemoglobin, and complement component proteins (highlighted in Table S1 ). We have confirmed that complement components constitute the largest group of bacteriabinding serum proteins in fish. Other bactericidal proteins, such as lysozyme [26] , were also identified in our experiments. In addition, our data on the binding of coagulating factors to E. tarda (Fig. 3 ) confirm the use of plasminogen, together with treptokinase and fibrinogen, by bacteria to neutralize the actions of complement factors [27] . Our data also show the interaction of transferrin, hemopexin and hemoglobin with E. tarda, a process used by bacteria to scavenge iron through the capture of iron-containing proteins [28e30]. These identified bacteria-binding proteins are consistent with known antibacterial mechanisms and bacterial evasion tactics.",

In addition, we identified a number of serum proteins with no previous indication of immune-related functions or bacteria-binding properties (Table S1 ). Our data, therefore, can be viewed as a shortlist of proteins potentially acts as factors important in host-bacteria interactions in fish. For example, we demonstrated that IQCH protein, a highly tissue-specific protein induced by bacterial infection, was present in fish serum and could bind to bacteria. Future investigations will confirm the interactions of IQCH protein, as well as other bacteria-binding serum proteins discovered in this study, with E. tarda by Western blotting and by using recombinant proteins. The functional roles of these unknown proteins in the innate immunity of fish should be addressed.",

We reported the identification and quantitation of 164, 251, 291, 277 and 384 bacterial proteins relatively from five time points (5, 30, 60, 90, 120 min) after serum treatment. As far as we know, this is the largest proteomic study of the effect of animal serum on bacteria. Although our shotgun approach limited the number of proteins that could be measured across time points, we neverthesless were able to analyze the kinetics of more than 200 bacterial proteins in response to Turbot serum (Table S2) . Although the proteomic approach has been applied on gram-negative bacteria exposed to other stresses, these studies generally focused on the impact of single, isolated factors on the bacterial proteome. Fish serum is a complex mixture of molecules, in which at least 76 proteins interact with the bacteria. Here, we showed that the proteomic signature of E. Tarda in response to whole serum treatment was distinct from other previously studied environmental stresses or cytotoxic agents. This possibly represents the combined effects of the multiple serum factors on the bacteria. For example, our observation of the induction of outer membrane proteins after turbot sera treatment is consistent with their role of sequestering complement C4b protein for immune evasion [32] . The upregulation of membrane components in bacteria has also been observed after antibiotic treatment. However, unlike other stresses, fish serum appeared to induce a rapid and general shutdown of all proteins apart from outer membrane proteins.",

These findings give us a hint to the bactericidal mechanism of turbot serum proteins. In our data, serum proteins elicited a very strong inhibition on the bacteria antioxidant system (Fig. 4) . Bacteria defend against oxidative stresses by the thioredoxin system that includes thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH [33] and by TCA cycle intermediates such as isocitrate dehydrogenase and phosphoglyceromutase [34] . While these factors provide a constitutive protection, peroxide scavengers like catalase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (Ahpc) [35] are rapidly induced by stresses [36] . Unlike other ROS products, H 2 O 2 is more stable and can diffuse across bacterial membranes and causes more widespread damages in the cells [13] . In particular, catalases is predominant at coping with a high concentration (millimolar) or a sudden burst of H 2 O 2 because they do not require reductants like NADH, which is necessary for AphC [25, 37] . While other stresses stimulate the expression of calatase, our data show that fish serum caused a rapid and dramatic reduction of catalase expression and activity, resulting in a significant accumulation of ROS in E. tarda. As catalase is the primary detoxifier of H 2 O 2 [38] , our data suggest that heat labile factors in the serum of fish, and possibly in other animals, can specifically suppress the antioxidants in bacteria and sensitize bacteria to ROS [39] . Our proteomic data also show that Fe-S cluster proteins were reduced, in accordance with previous studies that H 2 O 2 can damage Fe-S cluster proteins by converting stable Fe-S to an unstable [4Fee4S] 3\u00fe [40] . Through this pathway, ferryl radical ([FeO] 2\u00fe ) can be created and decay into hydroxyl radical (HO ), which can further damage DNA, proteins, and lipids synthesis, resulting in cell death [41] .",

In some cases, the microbial community associated with plants has been shown to alleviate plant stress and increase plant growth under suboptimal growing conditions. A systematic understanding of how the microbial community changes under these conditions is required to understand the contribution of the microbiome to water utilization, nutrient uptake, and ultimately yield. Using a microbiome inoculation strategy, we studied how the belowground microbiome of Populus deltoides changes in response to diverse environmental conditions, including water limitation, light limitation (shading), and metal toxicity. While plant responses to treatments in terms of growth, photosynthesis, gene expression and metabolite profiles were varied, we identified a core set of bacterial genera that change in abundance in response to host stress. The results of this study indicate substantial structure in the plant microbiome community and identify potential drivers of the phytobiome response to stress. IMPORTANCE The identification of a common \"stress microbiome\" indicates tightly controlled relationships between the plant host and bacterial associates and a conserved structure in bacterial communities associated with poplar trees under different growth conditions. The ability of the microbiome to buffer the plant from extreme environmental conditions coupled with the conserved stress microbiome observed in this study suggests an opportunity for future efforts aimed at predictably modulating the microbiome to optimize plant growth.",

Changes in the host organism or environment have been shown to shift the composition of the associated microbiota in humans (2, 3) , mice (4), coral (5) , and plants (6) . The additional functions encoded by members of the plant microbiome can modify nutrient uptake (7, 8) , produce (9) or degrade (9-11) plant hormones, prime host defense pathways against pathogens (12) and pests (13) , and ultimately affect both the above-and belowground growth of the host plant (14) (15) (16) . In communities, effects of individual members can be additive (17) , synergistic (18) (19) (20) , or antagonistic (21, 22) . As a complex community, the plant belowground microbiome has been shown to adapt rapidly to water limitation conditions and alleviate host stress (23, 24) . This ability of individual microbes and microbial communities to modify plant growth characteristics and alleviate stress suggests an opportunity to optimize plant growth for biomass and yield, either by increasing plant growth and productivity or by modulating metabolite profiles for downstream biomass processing. Toward this goal, a thorough understanding of the plant-microbiome relationship along with the response of the microbiome to changes in the host and environment is required.",

Recent 16S rRNA gene profiling studies of Populus growing in its natural habitat have contributed to our understanding of the Populus root microbiome community structure (25) (26) (27) (28) . These studies have demonstrated that Populus roots are host to a diverse bacterial community that differs on the basis of soil, geographic location, season, and host genotype but is most strongly influenced by the ecological niche (e.g., rhizosphere versus endosphere). Rhizosphere communities demonstrate an abundance of Acidobacteria that were greatly diminished in the endosphere (defined as within surface-sterilized root tissues), while Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, along with Actinobacteria, were enriched in the root endosphere. Understanding the interplay between rhizosphere and root communities is critical for tailored microbiome intervention strategies to improve plant productivity.",

Climate change has led to changing precipitation regimes and more extreme weather events (29) , and the ability of the microbiome to buffer against water limitation (23) provides an opportunity to mitigate the effect of these conditions in the field. Water limitation conditions have been shown to affect the microbiome by decreasing mycorrhizal colonization, ultimately decreasing nutrient acquisition by the host plant (30) . Shading and cloud cover are natural limitations on light, decrease overall biomass production, and lead to structural changes in Populus species (31) . These inhibitors have been shown to impact metabolite profiles in tomato (32) and tea (33) plants. Shading can significantly affect plant metabolite profiles and has been proposed as a method for optimizing secondary metabolite production (34) . Shading, and the ultimate effect on plant photosynthesis and carbon allocation, also shifts the association of the plant with beneficial microbes in the environment (35) . Finally, the presence of toxins and inorganic chemicals in the environment impacts the microbial community directly as antimicrobial compounds (36) or indirectly by either inhibiting the proliferation of other community members (37) or modifying the host exudate and chemical profile. Copper is an essential micronutrient for plants, but at high concentrations, it can inhibit plant growth in rice (38) . In Populus, excess copper is accumulated in roots and decreases leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthesis (39, 40) .",

These studies identified core responses that were conserved across stress treatments which helped map the functions of genes and proteins in stress response. Gene expression studies show that while plants encode a wide range of mechanisms to deal with unique stresses, there is a subset of genes that are regulated in response to generic stress (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) . For example, similar patterns of unique and core responses were observed in metabolite profiles in Zea mays (maize) responses to drought and heat stress (52) . Similar to analysis of individual genes on host function, individual microbiome members have been shown to modulate gene expression on the basis of the presence of plant metabolites (53, 54) , suggesting a response to changes in the host metabolome, and indeed, the microbiome community has been linked to changes in the chemical environment of the host in engineered lignin mutants of Populus (55) . In this work, we aimed to determine if a core response occurs in the microbiome of plants subjected to diverse stresses. Understanding how the plant and its associated microbiome respond to changes in the environment is critical for harnessing the protective and adaptive powers of the microbiome. We hypothesized that subsets of the plant belowground microbiome community (root and rhizosphere) would mirror the host response to stress, showing both a treatmentspecific response and a core stress response showing microbial abundance changes that are shared between stress treatments. Using a microbiome inoculation strategy, we studied how Populus deltoides and its associated belowground microbiome respond to abiotic stresses of water limitation, shading, and copper toxicity.",

Uninoculated control plants were colonized by microbes from the greenhouse environment and were included primarily to ensure that the inoculation strategy resulted in a microbiome representative of that in other Populus studies. After acclimation to greenhouse conditions (~2 weeks), inoculated plants were subjected to one of three environmental stressors, water limitation (cyclic drought based on individual plant responses with plants reaching drought conditions three to five times throughout the treatment period; Fig. S1 ), shade (80% light interception), or heavy metal toxicity (30 M CuSO 4 in nutrient solution). Stem height and leaf number were measured weekly during treatments ( Fig. 1A and B ) and were significantly reduced by the end of the treatment in shaded plants (height, P \u03fd 0.001; leaf number, P \u03fd 0.001 [Student's t test]) and water-limited plants (height, P \u03fd 0.001; leaf number, P \u03fd 0.001 [Student's t test]). In water-limited plants, the LMA was increased (5.80 versus 5.13 mg/cm ; P \u03fd 0.05 [Student's t test]), consistent with a decreased surface area to reduce water loss to the environment (Fig. S2) . In shaded plants, the total leaf area and LMA were significantly reduced (leaf area, 600 versus 1,890 cm 2 ; P \u03fd 0.001; LMA, 3.26 versus 5.13 mg/cm 2 ;",

Plants were randomly selected to complete measurements between 10 am and 2 pm on subsequent days. Net photosynthesis and water use were significantly reduced in water-limited plants ( Fig. 1D; Fig. S2 ). Interestingly, we observed an increase in instantaneous water use efficiency in copper-treated plants ( Plant transcriptional response to stress. Plant tissue was collected at the end of the stress treatments and measured for transcriptional response by transcriptome sequencing (three plants per condition, excluding uninoculated controls). Transcriptional profiles clustered by treatment ( Fig. 2A) and were analyzed to determine significant over-and underrepresentation of responsive groups (Fig. 2B) . Genes annotated to participate in photosynthesis were downregulated relative to the control in copper-treated plants. Specifically, photosystem I (PSI) was decreased (\u03ea2.51-fold), with the gene ontology (GO) category for PSI polypeptide subunits decreased \u03ea3.05-fold. Photosystem II (PSII) was also decreased (\u03ea6.07-fold), with both LHC-II (\u03ea2.97-fold) and PSII polypeptide subunits decreased (\u03ea4.63-fold). In drought and shade treatments, photosynthesis genes were upregulated, consistent with carbon starvation. Specifically, the GO category annotated as light reaction was upregulated 2.92-fold in water-limited plants and 6.4-fold in light-limited plants, with the ATP synthase and cytochrome b 6 /f GO categories upregulated in light-limited plants (3.1-and 2.1-fold). Additionally, the GO category annotated as PSII genes was upregulated 4.1-fold, with the PSII polypeptide subunit group upregulated 3.0-fold. RNA, DNA, and protein metabolism were downregulated in copper-and shade-treated plants but upregulated in drought plants relative to the controls. Copper-treated plants showed downregulation relative to the control of chloroplast ribosomal proteins, consistent with the copper ion interacting with photosynthetic membranes. Drought-treated plants showed an increase in the expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism, as well as cellular organization and vesicle transport, relative to the controls (Fig. 2) . The common change observed across treatments was an increase in the expression of protein degradation pathways. We also observed responses in hormone signaling, cell structure, and stress pathways. These results are supported by complementary quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR analysis of the expression of a panel of selected genes (Data Set S1). Together, these results indicate a unique response of plants to each treatment.",

                "text": "Global metabolite shifts indicate a specific host response to stress. Leaf metabolites were measured at the end of the treatments by using gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) for four plants per treatment. We detected 122 unique peaks and partially or fully identified 95 metabolites, which were further classified into groups on the basis of host pathways or chemical functionality ( Fig. 3) . Consistent with the transcriptome response, metabolites in the lipid synthesis group were upregulated in water-limited plants. In copper-treated plants, we observed high levels of aromatics and sugar conjugates, including phenolic glycosides. Central metabolites were moderately affected by water limitation and copper treatments. Though copper induced a moderate decrease in citrate, light limitation resulted in a decrease in multiple tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites (glycerate, succinate, methylmalonate), and significant increases in aconitate (Student's t test, P \u03fd 0.05). These changes are consistent with other studies of the TCA cycle response to light (56) . Metabolites in the amino acid group showed similar response patterns between stresses and in general followed patterns predicted by transcriptome analyses. Alanine, glutamate, aspartate, and the precursor 5-oxo-proline were all decreased in response to the copper, water limitation, and shade treatments, while glycine increased. In light-limited plants, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid increased while serine decreased. Lipids and membrane- associated metabolites were affected the most by copper treatment, with mono-and digalactosylglycerol decreased 1.7-fold. The aromatic group includes a distinct set of metabolites (including gallate, ferulate, coumarate, 1,2,4-benzene triol, 3-and 4-hydroxybenzoate, and catechin) that decreased in response to all treatments. Salicylate (2-hydroxybenzoate) also increased moderately in all stresses. In the water limitation treatment, multiple aromatic conjugates (purpurin and five partially identified caffeoyl conjugate peaks) increased. Copper treatment and water limitation showed similar responses in the phenolic glycosides, with increases in nearly all of the metabolites detected in this group. Overall, the shade-treated plants responded in the opposite direction of copper and water limitation treatments with respect to the phenolic glycoside group. Water and light limitation resulted in similar expression patterns of sugar and sugar acids, though the changes were more pronounced in light-limited plants. In light-limited plants, fructose decreased from 8,800 g/g of fresh weight (gFW) in controls to only 835 g/gFW. Raffinose and sugar alcohols (including arabitol, ribitol, glycerol, and myo-inositol) increased in water-limited plants. Both erythronate and threonate were decreased in response to all treatments, and other conjugated sugars decreased in shade plants, consistent with decreased metabolism in leaves. We next correlated gene expression data with metabolite concentrations (Pear- son R, Data Set S1). Of the 1,000 most significant correlations, azelaic acid was the most highly correlated with gene expression data (60 genes), followed by the amino acids lysine (35 genes) and serine (28 genes). In Arabidopsis, azelaic acid is a signaling factor in systemic resistance that affect salicylic acid signaling and resistance to P. syringae pathogens (57) . Microbiome changes in response to stress. Microbiome community composition in the root and rhizosphere was measured by 16S amplicon sequencing and, at the phylum level, is similar to that observed in other poplar microbiome studies, with a high abundance of Proteobacteria and representation of Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (25, 26) . Primary analyses of root (including both the internal and external root environments) and rhizosphere communities showed clustering on the basis of isolation compartment, and thus, further analyses were performed separately ( Fig. S1 ; Data Set S1).",

Control and copper samples overlapped, with two controls predicted as copper treatments and four copper treatments predicted as controls.

In this work, we present a systems level approach to the study of the phytobiome response to environmental treatments that induce plant stress. Using a belowground microbiome inoculation study and functional measures of plant growth, including gas exchange and fluorescence, plant transcriptional response, metabolite profile response, and microbiome community response, we show that the plant and associated belowground bacteria exhibit both stress-specific and core stress responses. This study suggests that the core microbiome members identified above appear to be tightly coupled to the physiology of the host plant and highlights the need for further testing to identify mechanisms of community change and consequences for phytobiome function and fitness. Plant responses, as measured by growth patterns, gas exchange and productivity, and leaf gene and metabolite expression profiles, indicated that plants were stressed in response to metal toxicity, water, and light limitation. However, the severity of the stress was likely different among copper, drought, and shade treatments. Consistent with previous studies, we observed decreases in plant productivity, shifts in gene expression toward the production of cell wall components, and decreases in photosynthetic processes (61) in water-limited plants. Previous work has shown that stress severity in drought treatments impacts the plant response at the physiological and gene expression levels (62) , which presumably has subsequent downstream effects on the microbiome of the plant. The drought treatment in this study was cyclic, acute, and implemented in accordance with the individual plant response. With this approach, some plants experienced two drought cycles and others as many as five throughout the treatment period; however, a consistent response in terms of a microbiome effect was observed ( Fig. 4 and 5 ). There may be a differential response in plants maintained under long-term low-water conditions. Drought conditions affect both plant and soil environments, and these soil environmental effects likely contributed to the observed changes in the microbiome, especially in the rhizosphere (63) . In contrast, the light limitation treatment is more specifically a host effect, limiting changes in the soil environment compared to water limitation. However, the reduced water requirements of shaded plants, as well as the decreased soil temperature owing to lack of direct sunlight may have affected environmental conditions and indirectly contributed to changes in the microbiome. In this work, copper stress was likely the least severe of the three treatments, as indicated by growth measurements and transcriptional responses. The lower stress severity may explain the observed weaker changes in the microbiome response. Conversely, the antimicrobial properties of copper may also have affected root-associated microbes directly or indirectly (37) , which might contribute to the significant response in the gene expression results, which showed increases in the biotic stress pathway. Despite the diverse environmental changes imposed by these treatments, we did observe a common response in the microbiome community structure ( Fig. 4 and 5 ) that is best explained by the influence of the stressed host plant. The observation of a core stress microbiome was further supported by the results from a naive Bayes classifier in which stress samples that were incorrectly identified were primarily identified as one of the complementary stress treatments (Data Set S1).",

In water-limited plants, we observed consistent changes in metabolite profiles as consistent with other studies, which show increases in amino acids, phenolic compounds, and soluble sugars and sugar derivatives in leaves (64) (65) (66) (67) . Similarly, we observed changes in shaded plant metabolite profiles consistent with other studies of light limitation (32, 33, 68) . In Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) trees, shading leads to lipid-dominated respiration, as opposed to the carbohydratedominated respiration that is observed in water-limited trees (69) . In Stellaria, shading changed the composition of gibberellins and auxin (70) . Both shade and drought conditions have been shown to modulate carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid contents in Pinus trees (69) . However, it is not possible to conclude from this study or past studies whether changes in leaf metabolite profiles are a direct response to the environment and lead to changes in the microbiome or if the changes are a feedback result of changes in the microbial community. Plant metabolites have been shown to impact the microbial community (55) , and inoculation by root microbes has been shown to impact leaf metabolite profiles (17) , confounding the cause-effect relationship between the plant and its microbiome. Correlation analyses between OTUs and metabolites suggest that phenolic glycosides or other sugar conjugates may be driving plant-microbe interactions in this system, supporting the hypothesis that the plant host controls microbiome community members through differential feeding or inhibition of competitors. In addition, the identification of azelaic acid as highly correlated with gene expression data suggests some level of systemic resistance response to stresses (57), potentially contributing to the microbes associated with the plant. Anaerolineae, uncultured phyla, Rhizobiales, and Acidobacteriaceae OTUs were correlated with gene expression data, indicating a potential relationship between the microbiome response and the plant response (Data Set S1). Further work is needed to elucidate the relationships among gene expression, metabolite production, and OTU abundances in order to understand and predict microbiome interactions with host plants.",

We did measure the photosynthesis kinetics of drought-treated plants and observed a functional response at the phytobiome level, but it is unclear how the microbiome responds during this dynamic time in the environment. Some microbes may be fast responders, on the order of hours, while others respond on the order of weeks. Additionally, the recovery of the plant microbiome as a community after host stress is unknown. Understanding how the microbiome rebounds after stress will also help us identity which microbes are important contributors to phytobiome function.

Bulk leaf tissue was collected, flash frozen, and ground in liquid nitrogen, and then 50 g was twice extracted overnight with 2.5 ml of 80% ethanol in water at room temperature. Sorbitol was added (to achieve a 10-ng/l final concentration) before extraction as an internal standard to correct for differences in extraction efficiency, subsequent differences in derivatization efficiency, and changes in sample volume during heating. Extracts were pooled, and 1 ml of the extract was dried with a nitrogen stream. Dried extracts were dissolved in acetonitrile, N-methyl-Ntrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane was added, and samples were then heated for 1 h at 70\u00b0C to generate trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives (78, 79) . After 2 days, aliquots were injected into an Agilent 5975C inert XL gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The standard quadrupole gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer is operated in the electron impact (70 eV) ionization mode, targeting 2.5 full-spectrum (50 to 650 Da) scans per second, as described previously (79) . Metabolite peaks were extracted by using a key selected ion, characteristic m/z fragment, rather than the total ion chromatogram, to minimize the integration of coeluting metabolites. The extracted peaks of known metabolites were scaled to the total ion current by using predetermined scaling factors. Peaks were quantified by area integration, and the concentrations were normalized to the quantity of the internal standard recovered and the amount of sample extracted, derivatized, and injected. A large user-created database (~2,300 spectra) of mass spectral electron impact ionization fragmentation patterns of TMS-derivatized compounds, as well as the Wiley Registry 10th edition combined with the National Institute of Standards and Technology 2014 mass spectral library, was used to identify the metabolites of interest to be quantified. There were four replicate plants per treatment, and treatment differences were tested for statistical significance with Student's t tests. Data are presented as log fold changes, which were calculated by determining fold changes defined as absolute values of changes up or down and then scaled by taking the logarithm of the data and applying a plus or minus sign to indicate an increase or decrease in expression, respectively. Flash-frozen leaf tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen and then dried. Samples were analyzed in triplicate for 60 s with the Bruker Tracer III-SD X-ray fluorescence instrument (Bruker, Billerica, MA) and the included vacuum pump at a voltage of 15 kV and a current of 25 A.

Shannon diversity was averaged for eight plants per condition and compared in Student's t tests. A naive Bayes classifier was built with the python sklearn package by assuming a Gaussian distribution.

To capture OTUs consistently associated with plants in our experiment, OTU tables were filtered before network generation by omitting any OTU that occurred in \u03fd80% of the samples as a cutoff for potential contaminants and spurious reads. The average correlation out of 20 iterations was calculated, and then edges were selected to be significant at P values of \u03fd0.1 on the basis of 100 resampled OTU data sets, resulting in \u03fe100,000 edges per network. Network edges were reduced first by determining the relationship between the numbers of edges and nodes ( Fig. S4A and B) and then by stepwise correlation (Fig. S4C to H) . By this method, we selected the top 10,000 edges (sorted by descending correlation score) for analysis.",

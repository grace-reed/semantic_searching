ATP-binding cassette protein subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1, P-glycoprotein) can transport a variety of substrates across the cell membrane in aquatic animals. In this study, to provide insight into the roles of ABCB1 in resistance against Cu in oysters, complete cDNA of abcb1 gene in Crassostrea angulata was cloned and analyzed. The complete sequence of C. angulata ABCB1 showed high identity to ABCB1 from other bivalves and contained some classical motifs of ABCB transport proteins. Abcb1 was mainly expressed in the apical epithelial cell of gills and epithelia of mantles. Abcb1 expression and Cu accumulation were also studied in control oysters and oysters exposed to Cu (30, 100, 300 \u03bcg/L Cu, 1-15 days Q4). Cu accumulation in the gill and mantle were measured after abcb1 gene interference. The complete sequence of C. angulata ABCB1 showed high identity to ABCB1 from other bivalves and contained some classical motifs of ABCB transport proteins. The mRNA transcript of abcb1 showed hypersensitivity to Cu exposure. A concentration-dependent highest abcb1 mRNA level (up to 5.61-fold to the control) in the gill and mantle existed across all Cu exposure concentrations after 3 days of Cu exposure. The gill and mantle Cu concentration were significantly higher after the abcb1 mRNA interference. According to these results, it is here speculated that ABCB1 may underlie cell protection against Cu in C. angulata.",

The most contaminated oysters can have a Cu body concentration as high as 14,000 \u03bcg/g dry body weight, and their tissue color becomes blue or green (Wang et al., 2011) . An oyster's ability to accumulate Cu is much greater than that of most other organisms (Han and Hung, 1990; Wang et al., 2011) . To survive with such high Cu concentration in their bodies, oysters have to tightly control intracellular levels of Cu. They may have developed several, probably coexisting, metal resistance mechanisms. Most of the investigations of adaptive mechanisms in oysters exposed to Cu have focused on the subcellular distribution of Cu and its ecotoxicological significance. Partitioning and sequestration are critical to the survival of the oysters with high body concentrations of Cu (Blanchard et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Pan and Wang, 2012) . With the availability of an increasing array of genomic and proteomic tools, many possibly functional genes and proteins have been discovered (Thompson et al., 2012; Garcia-Lagunas et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2014) .

The expression levels of these genes, activity of putative MXR pumps, protein levels, and homology of cDNA sequences of ABC transporter genes have been investigated in a variety of marine invertebrates including worms, sponges, mollusks, daphnia, copepods, sea urchins, and coral (Minier et al., 1993; Bard, 2000; Venn et al., 2009; Della Torre et al., 2012; Cole et al., 2013; Campos et al., 2014; Jeong et al., 2014) . These studies involved many toxicants containing heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Cd), oil dispersants, hydrocarbons, and marine antifouling paints. There are some studies that have focused on the oysters: expression of ABCB1 proteins in the gills of oyster C. virginica and C. gigas; cDNA sequences and expression pattern of abcb1 in C. ariakensis and C. virginica (Minier et al., 1993; Keppler and Ringwood, 2001; Ivanina and Sokolova, 2008; Xu et al., 2014) . Although previous studies have indicated that the MXR mechanism involves many toxicants, water temperature, and specific classes of sediment contaminants, no research has been performed on MXR in the regulation of oyster Cu homeostasis.",

The PCR program was as follows: 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 54\u00b0C for 20 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. Melting curve analysis of amplification products was performed at the end of each PCR reaction to confirm that only one PCR product had been amplified and detected. Each sample was run in triplicate along with the internal control gene. The comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method was used to analyze the relative expression level, and fold change for the gene expression relative to the control was determined using the 2 \u2212\u25b3\u25b3Ct method 262 (Bustin et al., 2009) . The average Ct of the beta-actin and EF1\u03b1 was 263 used to normalize the expression level of abcb1. The data represent the means of four to six replicates, respectively. Comparisons among the different specimens were made by one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences were accepted at P b 0.05.",

After 7 days of acclimation, 6 oysters were randomly chosen and dissected. Their gills and mantles were used for analysis to determine the initial baseline Cu concentrations. Then, 30 oysters were randomly divided into two groups (GFP control group, abcb1-dsRNA). All the dsRNA were injected into the adductor muscle every three days for a total of four times. The shells of these oysters were drilled near the adductor muscle using a microbit (1-2 mm) to facilitate dsRNA injection. The injection volume was 50 \u03bcL of saline solution and the dsRNA dose was 100 \u03bcg. Approximately 48 h after the first injection, 5 individuals that had been randomly selected from each group were dissected.

In order to provide more information on ABCB1 in bivalves, especially their role in metal transposition, full-length cDNA of ABCB1 from C. angulata were identified and cloned. ABC transporters are constituted of at least two conserved regions, a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD) (Holland et al., 2003) . The C. angulata ABCB1 contains two typical ABC transporter transmembrane domains and two ATP binding sites. This is consistent with the typical structure of other organism's ABCB transporters, such as C. ariakensis (Ambudkar et al., 2006; Luckenbach and Epel, 2008; Xu et al., 2014) . The oyster ABCB1 diverged early during the evolution of eukaryotes, and its genes have continuously evolved. The ABCB1 proteins have strongly evolutionarily conserved regions, found in lower multiple-cell animals and higher vertebrate animals. Among different species of mammals, the ABCB1 proteins show more than 90% amino acid identity (human, Chlorocebus aethiops, Canis lupus familiaris). Unlike the mammals, the ABCB1 between the marine bivalves show major differences outside of the conservative region. For example, C. angulata ABCB1 shared 67% identity with C. gigas and 62% with Mytilus galloprovincialis. Even the C. angulata amino acids show closer to the vertebrates in some regions",

Immuno-localization of ABC multidrug transporters in Indian rock oyster also showed an apical epithelial localization of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) in the gills, digestive tracts, and cytoplasmic areas of basal cells of the mantle (Kingtong et al., 2007) . Gills and mantles are the oysters' filter-feeding tissues and they take part in respiration and secretion. They come into direct contact with the external environments and are well supplied with blood vessels, suggesting that they are the major barriers between the environments, hemolymph, and internal organs. They are also the primary tissues in oysters that take in metal contaminants (Jing et al., 2006; Luo et al., 2014) . The abcb1 gene showed considerable expression in the epithelia of gills and 434 mantles, which indicates that ABC multidrug transporters also play an 435 important role in the establishment of important biological barriers that help the organism resist environmental stress.",

In a previous study, C. angulata that had been exposed to 200 \u03bcg/L or more of Cu showed disorganization and apical alterations in the cilia cells, hyperplasia, lamellar fusion, and lamellar loss in the gills; hemocytic infiltration in the underlying connective tissue, and numerous brown cells not observed in control specimens (de la Rua et al., 2005) . This suggested that exposure to Cu at concentrations approaching the 300 \u03bcg/L disrupted cellular Cu homeostasis and caused severe damage. In this study, the Cu concentration in the gills and mantles increased in a concentration-and time-dependent manner at lower concentrations of Cu (30 and 100 \u03bcg/L). The tissue Cu burden of the high-exposure group (300 \u03bcg/L) was lower than in the moderateexposure group (100 \u03bcg/L). These findings were similar to the frequency of micronuclei in the hemocytes of the M. galloprovincialis after 4 days of Cu exposure: levels were significantly higher at 100 \u03bcg/L and a little higher at 500 \u03bcg/L (Brooks et al., 2015) .

This might be related to an adaptive response that may be mediated by various mechanisms. Cu toxicity was reduced by compartmentalization, such as in the membrane-limited vesicles in oysters (Wang et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2014) . Many factors may be involved in the detoxification for the exceeded Cu. Even to transport the exceeded toxins out of the cell via a membrane protein which includes not only the ABCBs but also other ABC subfamilies. The activity and expression of an ABCC/MRPtype transporter was detected in the gills of the California mussel M. californianus and in PLHC-1 fish cell line (Luckenbach and Epel, 2008; Della Torre et al., 2012) . ABCB1 is only one of numerous possible mechanisms. So when exposed to the low concentrations of Cu (30 \u03bcg/L), oysters quickly adapted to the challenge, and many adaptation mechanisms maintain cellular Cu homeostasis. Abcb1 mRNA levels first rose and then fell to nearly control levels at lower Cu levels. A similar observation was reported in the digestive glands of mussels and PLHC-1 fish cell line after long-term exposure to Hg 2+ : long-term exposure does not involve prolonged gene up-regulation (Franzellitti and Fabbri, 2006; Della Torre et al., 2012) . However, as the concentration increases, the expression of abcb1 still remained high in groups exposed to high concentrations of Cu at day 15 (100 and 300 \u03bcg/L). The test oysters suffered extreme damage and some of them died (Fig. 4) .",

To confirm speculation that ABCB1 can transport Cu as a substrate and play an important role in the Cu detoxification, abcb1 gene interference was performed in the present study. The Cu enrichment levels of the gills and mantle were significantly higher after abcb1 gene interference. The transcription level of abcb1 affected the accumulation of Cu in C. angulata. Some studies in invertebrate animals showed ABCB1 to have similar functions in response to metal exposure. For example, the transport activity of the ABCB1 protein indicated by rhodamine fluorescence was triggered by excess metal intake in Tigriopus japonicas. ABCB1's ability to remove metal was tested in Drosophila melanogaster and soil nematodes (Broeks et al., 1996; Callaghan and Denny, 2002; Jeong et al., 2014) .",

RNA extraction and molecular cloning of abcb1 gene sequencesTotal RNA was extracted from 100 mg of gill and mantle tissues separately using Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL, U.S.), quantified usingNanoDrop ND-2000 (Thermo Scientific, Les Ulis, France), and assessed 168 by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RNA were treated with DNase I 169 (Invitrogen) to remove possible contaminating DNA. Then, 1 \u03bcg of 170 total RNA from each tissue was used as a template for the reverse transcription reaction with a Prime Script II first-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit 172 (Takara, China). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized and used as the 173 template for further PCR analysis. 174 Based on the conserved sequence of abcb1 gene from Crassostrea gigas (GenBank accession no. XM_011414311), the partial cDNA fragment of abcb1 from C. angulata was cloned and re-sequenced. To obtain the full-length cDNA of abcb1, both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5\u2032-RACE and 3\u2032-RACE) were conducted with the 5\u2032-Full RACE Kit and 3\u2032-Full RACE Core Set Ver. 2.0 (Takara, Dalian, China) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, respectively. Matching oligonucleotide primers were designed using the Primer Premier 5.0 software (PRIMER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.). The genespecific primers used in the RACEs are listed in Supplementary File 1. Both the 5\u2032-RACE and 3\u2032-RACE products were cloned into pMD19-T Simple Vector (TAKARA, China) and sequenced. To confirm the accuracy of the sequence of abcb1 through the RACE, pairs of gene-specific 187 primers (Supplementary File 1) were used for amplifying abcb1 188 cDNAs with polymerase Ex Taq (Takara). The purified PCR products were cloned into a pMD-19 T vector and transmitted into competent cells of DH5\u03b1, then plated on LB-Agar flat and five independent clones191",

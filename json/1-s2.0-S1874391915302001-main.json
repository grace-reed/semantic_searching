    "abstract": "Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide results in ocean acidification and warming, significantly impacting marine invertebrate larvae development. We investigated how ocean acidification in combination with warming affected D-veliger larvae of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Larvae were reared for 40 h under either control (pH 8.1, 20\u00b0C), acidified (pH 7.9, 20\u00b0C), warm (pH 8.1, 22\u00b0C) or warm acidified (pH 7.9, 22\u00b0C) conditions. Larvae in acidified conditions were significantly smaller than in the control, but warm acidified conditions mitigated negative effects on size, and increased calcification. A proteomic approach employing two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to quantify proteins and relate their abundance to phenotypic traits. In total 12 differentially abundant spots were identified by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. These proteins had roles in metabolism, intra-and extra-cellular matrix formations, stress response, and as molecular chaperones. Seven spots responded to reduced pH, four to increased temperature, and six to acidification and warming. Reduced abundance of proteins such as ATP synthase and GAPDH, and increased abundance of superoxide dismutase, occurred when both pH and temperature changes were imposed, suggesting altered metabolism and enhanced oxidative stress. These results identify key proteins that may be involved in the acclimation of C. gigas larvae to ocean acidification and warming. Significance: Increasing atmospheric CO 2 raises sea surface temperatures and results in ocean acidification, two climatic variables known to impact marine organisms. Larvae of calcifying species may be particularly at risk to such changing environmental conditions. The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is ecologically and commercially important, and understanding its ability to acclimate to climate change will help to predict how aquaculture of this species is likely to be impacted. Modest, yet realistic changes in pH and/or temperature may be more informative of how populations will respond to contemporary climate change. We showed that concurrent acidification and warming mitigates the negative effects of pH alone on size of larvae, but proteomic analysis reveals altered patterns of metabolism and an increase in oxidative stress suggesting non-additive effects of the interaction between pH and temperature on protein abundance. Thus, even small changes in climate may influence development, with potential consequences later in life.",

Elevated atmospheric CO 2 leads to increasing sea surface temperatures [2] and acidification of marine environments [3, 4] , with the oceans acting as a sink for more than a third of all anthropogenic carbon emissions [5] . End-of-the-century projections for atmospheric pCO 2 range from 600 to 1000 ppm (corresponding roughly to a decrease of 0.2-0.5 pH units) and an increase in sea surface temperatures of 0.6\u00b0C to 2.0\u00b0C, depending on the scenario adopted [1] . A direct consequence of this ocean acidification (OA) will be a reduction in the saturation state for carbonate ions [6] , which will make the calcification mechanisms employed by many marine organisms more energetically costly [7] , potentially putting them at a disadvantage compared to organisms that do not produce calcified structures [8] . Concurrent warming and acidification can result in synergistic negative effects on calcification [9] and other biological processes, although responses are likely to vary between taxa.",

The effects of changing environmental conditions on larvae are important to understand as these early life stages often represent a bottleneck for populations struggling to survive in the changing marine environment [13, 14] . Reductions of 0.5 pH units often results in reduced survival of marine molluscs, as shown for Mercenaria mercenaria, Argopecten irradians [15] and Crassostrea gigas [16] , while a pH decrease of 0.7 units can lead to abnormal development and high levels of mortality, as shown in C. gigas [17] and Mytilus galloprovincialis [18] . Increasing temperatures compound problems caused by acidification, increasing mortality and rates of abnormality and reducing size when both are considered concurrently, as shown in both the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata [19] and C. gigas [20] during the first 48 h of development.",

Although populations will typically have many generations to adapt to these average changes in pH and temperature [23] , coastal ecosystems also demonstrate temporal and regional variations in pH and temperature meaning many populations already face conditions predicted for the end-of-thecentury at certain points in time or in parts of their range [24] . Therefore identifying how organisms acclimate to these changes is a crucial step in understanding how populations might respond to global climate change. Even small changes in pH can influence growth and development: a reduction of 0.2 pH units resulted in significantly slower growth in both C. gigas and the Sydney rock oyster S. glomerata during the first 48 h of development [20] , while a reduction of 0.3 pH units reduced growth and calcification in C. gigas during the first three days of development [25] . On the other hand, small increases in temperature may result in faster rates of growth and development, offsetting negative effects of acidification [26] [27] [28] . Differences in growth and the timing of development may have important consequences for population dynamics and demography [29] , and developmental plasticity is a key source of variation in adult phenotypes, directly influencing evolution of populations and species [30, 31] . For these reasons, investigation of smaller changes in pH over single generations may provide a more realistic indication of how organisms will respond to ocean acidification.",

Proteomic techniques such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) can help to identify the mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity [33] without a priori expectations. Identification of differentially accumulated proteins highlights potential candidates involved in acclimatory or adaptive responses. In this study we characterize the effects of acidification and warming, both separately and together, on protein abundance in larvae of the Pacific oyster C. gigas 40 h postfertilization, at which point the vast majority of larvae have reached veliger stage and are calcifying [25] . C. gigas is a bivalve of commercial significance and is also an important ecosystem engineer [34] . The 2-DE methodology presented has already been validated in organs [35, 36] as well as in oocytes of this species [37] , and is used here to identify major changes in abundant and soluble larval proteins in response to near future change in pH and temperature, in order to identify key proteins involved in developmentally plastic phenotypes.",

Sex was determined under a light microscope and fertilisation was carried out with oocytes from five females combined and fertilized with the sperm from four males, and following a standard protocol [38] . Oocytes and sperm were periodically mixed, and after 90 min eggs were split equally among 12 openflow 5 L tanks in one of four treatments (3 replicates per treatment): 'control' (median temperature and median pH \u00b1 upper/lower bound = 19.9 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, pH 8.06 \u00b1 0.06), 'acidified' (19.8 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C, pH 7.87 \u00b1 0.05), 'warm' (21.7 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C, pH 8.09 \u00b1 0.05) and 'warm acidified' (21.8 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C, pH 7.87 \u00b1 0.03). To create these conditions, a large header tank (100 L) was filled with filtered and UV-sterilized sea water that had been warmed to 22\u00b0C. This water was then pumped directly to the three 'warm' treatment tanks and to two other header tanks (50 L), one in which water was cooled to 20\u00b0C via heat exchange, the other in which pH was reduced by bubbling CO 2 through a CO reactor (JBL GmbH & Co. KG, Neuhofen, Germany), maintained by negative feedback. These header tanks pumped water to the three 'control' and three 'warm acidified' treatment tanks respectively. Finally, water from the 'warm acidified' header tank was also pumped to a fourth header tank (50 L) where the water was cooled to 20\u00b0C by a second heat exchange, before being pumped to the three 'acidified' treatment tanks. Flow rate to experimental tanks was maintained at 80 ml min \u2212 1 , and the outflow passed through a 20 \u03bcm mesh filter to keep larvae in tanks. Larvae were kept in suspension and free from outflow filters by constantly bubbling air from the bottom of the tanks over the filters. An overview of the installation is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 . Temperature and pH in each treatment tank were measured at four times during the 40-hour experiment using a WTW pH 340i fitted with a WTW SenTix 41 pH electrode (WTW GmbH, Weilheim, Germany); total alkalinity was determined from bicarbonate titration of triplicated samples collected at three times from a large header tank (analyses performed by Labocea laboratories, Brest, France); and salinity measurements were taken before and after the experiment using a WTW LF 340-B conductivity salinometer (WTW GmbH, Weilheim, Germany). Values for dissolved inorganic carbon, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate ions, and saturation states of calcite and aragonite were calculated using the CO 2 SYS program [39] based on constants from Cai and Wang [40] fitted to the Total pH scale; mean conditions during the experiment are presented in Supplementary Table 1 .",

Larvae were viewed on an Olympus BX60 microscope fitted with an Olympus U-CMAD3 camera. For each treatment tank, 30-50 D-larvae were photographed under a fixed illumination of both white and polarizing light at 20\u00d7 magnification, and images were captured with analySIS start software (Olympus). Polarized light is refracted twice when passing through calcium carbonate, and the intensity of birefringence following double refraction provides a proxy for calcification. Size and birefringence measurements were assessed using ImageJ software [42] . Size was calculated as area in \u03bcm 2 , while birefringence was quantified as a grayscale score for polarized light images on a scale of 0-255 [43] . Checks for normality and homoscedasticity using Shapiro and Levene tests revealed that size data were non-normally distributed, and birefringence data were nonnormally distributed and heteroscedastic. Therefore non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by Bonferroni-corrected Dunn post-hoc tests were carried out to analyze differences between treatment groups. Dunn tests assume that cumulative distribution functions of treatment groups do not cross [44] . In order to meet this assumption, outlying birefringence samples (grayscale scores N 1.5 interquartile ranges beyond the 1st or 3rd quartile) were removed. All analyses were carried out using the dunn.test package [44] in R [45] .",

Solubilized proteins were extracted by centrifugations at 4000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The lipid layer was in the upper phase and was easily eliminated by pipetting. The interphase (around 1.5 ml) containing the proteins was collected and the small pellet of cell debris was left. The phase containing proteins was then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 45 min at 4\u00b0C to ensure total lipid depletion. The resulting lysates were aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for further analysis. Protein lysates were quantified using a D C protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with 96-well micro-plates (Nunc\u2122) in a micro-plate reader (Bio-Tek\u00ae SynergyTM HT) and KC4 v3 software to compare results with a calibration curve of standard proteins (Bovine Serum Albumin) provided with the D C protein assay kit. For each protein sample a Bradford assay was performed to make 500 \u03bcg of protein deposition. For each of the 12 samples, precipitation and desalting were performed by adding one volume of a mixture of TCA/acetone (20% TCA) and precipitating the proteins overnight at \u2212 20\u00b0C. Precipitated proteins were centrifuged at 20,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. After removing the supernatant, the protein pellet was neutralized 2-3 times by adding 150 \u03bcl of a solution of Tris-HCl pH 7.4 (50 mM)/80% acetone containing traces of bromophenol blue, used herein as a pH indicator, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min. The pellets were dried using a rotary evaporator (Eppendorf concentrator 5301) at 30\u00b0C for 10 min and resuspended in 250 \u03bcl of Destreak rehydration solution (GE Healthcare), containing 1% IPG buffer (pH 3-10) before being placed at room temperature for 1 h before isoelectric focusing (IEF). The IEF dimension was conducted on a IPGphor3 system (GE Healthcare) using the following protocol: 250 V for 15 min, 500 V for 2 h, gradient voltage increase to 1000 V for 1 h, gradient voltage increase to 8000 V for 2 h and 30 min, and 8000 V for 3 h, all carried out at 20\u00b0C. Before the second dimension, the IPG strip was rehydrated in a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS and 0.002% Bromophenol Blue for two 15 min periods, first with 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol, and then in the same solution containing 48 mg/ml iodoacetamide [46] .",

After rehydration in 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 and dehydration in 100% ACN, excised spots were air-dried and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C in a solution of 12.5 ng/\u03bcL modified trypsin (Promega) in 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 . The resulting tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel spots by several washes in formic acid/ACN/water as previously described [36] . The tryptic digests were then concentrated by vacuum centrifugation to reach a final volume of 30 \u03bcL. Mobile A (H 2 O/formic acid, 100:0.1) and B (ACN/formic acid, 100:0.1) phases for HPLC were delivered by the Ultimate 3000 nanoflow LC system (Dionex, LC Packings). 10 \u03bcL of peptide mixture was loaded on a trapping precolumn (5 mm \u00d7 300 \u03bcm i.d., 300 \u00c5 pore size, Pepmap C18, 5 \u03bcm) for 3 min in 2% buffer B at a flow rate of 25 \u03bcL/min. This step was followed by reverse-phase separations at a flow rate of 0.250 \u03bcL/min using an analytical column (15 cm \u00d7 300 \u03bcm i.d., 300 \u00c5 pore size, Pepmap C18, 5 \u03bcm, Dionex, LC Packings). A gradient ranging from 2% to 35% of buffer B was run for the first 60 min, 35% to 60% of buffer B from 60 to 85 min, and 60% to 90% of buffer B from 85 to 105 min. Finally, the column was washed with 90% of B for 16 min, and with 2% of B for 19 min prior to loading of the next sample. The peptides were detected by directly eluting them from the HPLC column into the nanoelectrospray ion source of the LTQ-Orbitrap XL (ThermoScientific) mass spectrometer. An ESI voltage of 1.4 kV was applied to the HPLC buffer using the liquid junction provided by the nanoelectrospray ion source and the ion transfer tube temperature was set to 200\u00b0C. The LTQ-Orbitrap XL instrument was operated in its data-dependent mode by automatically switching between full survey scan MS and consecutive MS/MS acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra (m/z 400-2000) were acquired in the OrbiTrap with a resolution of r = 60,000 at m/z 400; ion injection times are calculated for each spectrum to allow for accumulation of 106 ions in the OrbiTrap. The 10 most intense peptide ions in each survey scan with intensity above 2000 counts and a charge state \u2265 2 were sequentially isolated and fragmented in the ion trap by collision induced dissociation. Normalized collision energy was set to 35% with an activation time of 30 ms. Peaks selected for fragmentation were automatically put on a dynamic exclusion list for 60 s with a mass tolerance of \u00b110 ppm.",

In total 12 spots were found to be differentially expressed at our significance level of P b 0.02 ( Fig. 3 ) in at least one condition. All of these 12 protein spots were excised from gels, trypsinized and identified by LC-MS/MS (Table 1 ). Two spots that were both identified as severin (5 and 6) appeared to have similar molecular weights but different isoelectric points, suggesting posttranslational modification of this protein, such as phosphorylation. Two proteins (spots 7 and 12) were assigned C. gigas UniProt IDs corresponding to uncharacterized proteins. A protein blast of K1QWT8_CRAGI yielded G9MBW9_PINMA (Shell matrix protein in Pinctada maxima) as the nearest characterized protein (e-value = 16 e-9; score = 161; identity = 32.0%), while a protein blast of K1QVF8_CRAGI returned H9LJ92_CRAAR (USP-like protein isoform 2 in Crassostrea ariakensis) as the nearest characterized protein (evalue = 3.0 e-18; score = 194; identity = 58.0%). The direction and fold change in expression of all proteins are shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 2 . Seven of the proteins associated with these spots responded to reduced pH (the metabolic enzyme ATP synthase; intracellular-matrix proteins severin spots 5 and 6, and actin-2; extracellular matrix proteins matrilin-2 and shell matrix protein, and the glycolipoprotein vitellogenin-6), four responded to increased temperature (molecular chaperones GRP78 and PDI 2; severin spot 5; and the stress response protein USP-like protein isoform 2), and six responded to concurrent pH reduction and warming in the control versus warm acidified comparison (matrilin-2, ATP synthase, vitellogenin-6, USPlike protein isoform 2; the metabolic enzyme GAPDH, and the stress response protein SOD). Most proteins that responded to pH were less abundant when pH was reduced (five of seven: matrilin-2, ATP synthase, severin spots 5 and 6 and actin-2), while most proteins that responded to temperature were more abundant when temperature increased (three of four: GRP78, PDI 2, severin spot 5). Four of the six spots which responded to concurrent pH reduction and warming were less abundant (matrilin-2, ATP synthase, GAPDH, USP-like protein isoform 1). Furthermore, as Fig. 4 demonstrates, although the combined effects of reduced pH and warming were in some cases additive and synergistic (e.g. matrilin-2 and SOD), the combination of the two environmental variables also resulted in unexpected non-additive effects on metabolism, such as the larger fold changes in ATP synthase and vitellogenin that occurred when both pH and temperature were considered together, despite the variables seeming to act in the opposite directions when considered singly.",

Although larvae reared in the warm treatment were larger than control animals, those reared in the warm acidified treatment did not differ significantly in size from control animals, suggesting that concomitant warming may mitigate the negative effect of acidification on size [26] . In contrast, the acidified treatment did not result in a significant reduction in birefringence versus the control. However, birefringence scores were higher in the warm and warm acidified treatments than in the control, and larvae from the warm acidified treatment had lower birefringence scores than those from the warm treatment. This suggests that at higher temperatures, effects of acidification on calcification in C. gigas larvae may become more visible, and that size and calcification are influenced by temperature and pH in different ways.

ATP synthase is a protein complex located in the mitochondrial inner membrane that plays a fundamental role in ATP synthesis in all living organisms [50] , and is constitutively expressed at high levels in adult C. gigas [51] . ATP synthase gene expression was reduced in two studies of sea urchin larvae exposed to weak acidification (pH reduction of 0.05-0.15 units) [52, 53] , and protein abundance was also reduced when larvae of the polychaete Hydroides elegans were exposed to a pH reduction of 0.4 units [54] . A reduction in the abundance of ATP synthase at low pH points to a reduced ability to produce energy via oxidative metabolism. This may result from changes to the energy budget in response to reduced pH, and may also arise due to retarded development. ATP synthase increases in abundance during larval development of C. gigas [55] , so the reduction we observed could be the result of a developmental delay. The presence of 3.5-fold higher levels of vitellogenin following pH reduction at 22\u00b0C may corroborate this fact: vitellogenins are glycolipoproteins that act as yolk proteins for developing embryos in oviparous species Fig. 2 .

The name of identified proteins is shown in Table 1 along with details of the corresponding mass spectrometry data. [56] . Transcript [57] and protein [58] abundance of vitellogenin has been shown to decline during larval development of marine invertebrates as these maternally provisioned resources are consumed for nourishment. Therefore increased levels of vitellogenin in the warm acidified treatment could suggest that these resources are being consumed at a slower rate, which together with reduced ATP synthase abundance may point towards developmental retardation. Reduced development or growth as a result of reduced ATP synthase abundance could also help to explain the smaller size of animals in the acidified treatment compared to animals in the control.",

Blasting the amino acid sequence against the UniProt database found the nearest homolog to be a shell matrix protein from the Silver-lipped pearl oyster P. maxima (e-value = 16 e-9) This protein is itself a homolog of the better characterized aspein, as identified in the Akoya pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata [59] . Expression of the aspein gene occurs in the prismatic layer of the shell matrix in Pinctada species [59, 60] , suggesting a role in biomineralization. Our identification of increased shell matrix protein abundance in warm acidified versus warm conditions suggests that its accumulation may be a compensatory response to multiple environmental drivers, although in contrast to our results, Liu et al. [61] found that gene expression of aspein was down-regulated in adult P. fucata exposed to acidification and warming, and it is unclear if such differences arise due to species, life stage or expression/translation differences. Conversely, a different extra-cellular matrix protein, matrilin-2, accumulated less in the acidified compared to the control treatments. Matrilins are involved in vertebrate biomineralization processes [62] facilitating the deposition of collagen [63] , and may serve a similar function in molluscs, as similar proteins have been found to have a role in collagen binding-matrix protein in the byssus (attachment structure) of M. galloprovincialis [64] . However, matrilins have also been associated with Mytilus immune responses [65] and neural stimulation in Aplysia [66] , making it difficult to speculate on its role here in response to warming and acidification.",

Actins are highly abundant proteins within eukaryotic cells, while severins are part of the gelsolin family of capping proteins which regulate actin length [67] . Changes in structural protein abundance could be a sign of cytoskeletal remodeling, as structural proteins are key regulators of many cellular processes relating to cell division and shape [68] , However, given the ubiquity of these proteins in eukaryotic cells, reduced accumulation of actin and severin at lower pHs may simply reflect fewer cells in these individuals, which again may be the result of a developmental delay. Other studies on marine invertebrates have shown reduced abundance of cytoskeletal proteins in response to OA.

PDI (Protein disulfide isomerase) 2 responded positively to warming at pH 7.9, while GRP78, belonging to the heat-shock70 family of proteins, responded positively to warming at pH 8.1. The formation of disulfide bonds, as facilitated by PDIs, is a key step in protein folding for many extracellular proteins [70] , ensuring their stability under variable environmental conditions, and PDI has been demonstrated to be a marker of quality in C. gigas oocytes [37] . PDIs may sequester reactive oxygen species (ROS) [71] , and both PDIs and GRP78 help to prevent oxidative stress damage [72] , often acting in concert with one another [73] . The expression of GRP78 following long-term thermal stress has been previously demonstrated in adult Mytilus species [74] ; our results suggest that increased production of molecular chaperones may be a normal acclimatory response by C. gigas larvae even when temperature differences are only slight. The only protein to show decreased abundance in response to warming was universal stress protein (USP) like protein isoform 2, which accumulated less in larvae from the warm acidified treatment compared to the acidified treatment. USPs are a diverse family of proteins that, although initially characterized in bacteria, are also present in plants, fungi and metazoans. Although their functions are often linked to physiological stress responses [75] , USP-like proteins have been suggested to facilitate calcification in the coral Acropora millepora [76] , and to regulate growth in the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis via an ATP binding function [77] . A pH sensitive isoform of USP was identified in larvae of the closely-related Hong Kong oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis [78] and further research into expression and function of this protein family may improve our understanding of its role in larval responses to pH and temperature change. . Therefore, as well as identifying proteins that respond to changes in pH and temperature as single environmental variables, it is critical to consider how multiple concurrent changes to the environment will alter protein abundance. In larvae reared in the warm acidified treatment, six spots were identified as differentially abundant when compared to the control. Four of these were differentially abundant in either acidified (ATP synthase, matrilin-2, vitellogenin-6) or warm (USP-like protein isoform 2) treatments.

SOD is a key stress response of bivalves to warming [79] that is highly abundant in adult C. gigas [51] and actively expressed during metabolically active periods of development in marine invertebrates [80] . More abundant SOD in the warm acidified versus the control treatment suggests that the effect of these two environmental changes together results in more oxidative stress than when they are considered individually, possibly as a result of a metabolic shift. Such a shift may arise due to GAPDH. This protein alters carbohydrate flux, with reduced expression switching metabolism from glycolysis to pentose phosphate synthesis [33, 81] , allowing the maintenance of sufficient reducing equivalents to counteract oxidative stress, as has been shown in cold-stressed fish [82] . Furthermore, GAPDH was recently identified to be down-regulated in a 2-DE based study on thermal acclimation in the scallop Pecten maximus [83] . As well as its established role in the glycolytic pathway, GAPDH also appears to be involved in a diverse range of cellular processes, including as a transcription factor interacting with RNA polymerase II [84] , a signal protein via the mTOR pathway [85] and binding to various nucleic acids [86] , suggesting that it is a central node in a network of thermoregulated genes and proteins and may play a pivotal role in thermal acclimation [83] .",

One compelling result is the general decline in protein abundance when comparing acidified or warm acidified treatments with the control and/or warm treatments, which may be an underlying factor of reduced size in the acidified treatment, and reduced calcification in the warm acidified versus the warm treatment. A previous study of acidification on C. gigas larvae found a similar decline in protein abundance in lower pH treatments [69] , which may arise because marine invertebrates are often unable to effectively regulate the pH of their extracellular spaces [87, 88] , leading to reduced protein biosynthesis in acidified conditions [89] and developmental delay. Development may also be slowed by lower levels of ATP synthase reducing energy availability, and increased vitellogenin could indicate less consumption of maternal resources and therefore slower development. Acidification-induced delays have previously been observed to result in reduced size at a given age [90, 91] , in line with our own observations of reduced size. Conversely, increased temperature typically results in faster development and growth for ectotherms [92] . Increased protein metabolism is an underlying factor in faster rates of growth and development [93] , and accumulation of protein chaperones such as GRP78 and PDI 2 may ensure the correct folding of proteins [33] as protein turnover increases, thus permitting larvae in the warm treatment to reach a larger size and to calcify to a greater extent than control animals.",

In agreement with other studies, warming was able to mitigate some of the phenotypic negative effects of acidification on larval development [26] [27] [28] . However, our results also show that even if phenotypic differences are minor, protein accumulation is modified when considering the combination of reduced pH and increased temperature. Such differential accumulation produced additive responses, as was the case with SOD in which pH and temperature acted in the same direction individually as when combined, but also non-additive responses, as was the case for ATP synthase where pH and temperature acted in opposite directions individually, but in combination resulted in a magnified response to pH. These changes to the proteome underlie developmental plasticity and, to a certain extent, permit larval acclimation to changing environments. However, acclimation may not be sustainable over long periods and could carry later-life costs [95] . The identification of differential Table 2 Larval proteins significantly differentially accumulated in response to acidification at both temperatures, warming at both pHs, and the interaction of acidification and warming. Significantly different comparisons with a P-value of b0.02 are highlighted. abundance of key proteins such as ATP synthase, GAPDH and SOD during early development is an important step in understanding molecular mechanisms underpinning developmental plasticity of C. gigas larvae in environments with reduced pH and increased temperature. However, further proteomic studies are required to validate these results and investigate acclimatory protein responses over longer developmental periods and adaptive ones across generations. Moreover, information about protein abundance must be integrated with both preceding patterns of gene expression and subsequent measures of physiological quality such as lipid metabolism to better understand the mechanisms that might permit marine invertebrate larvae to cope with future climate change.",

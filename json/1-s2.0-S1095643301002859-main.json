We examined this 'host release factor' HRF response using freshly isolated zooxanthellae of differing nutritional status. The nutritional status was manipulated by either feeding or starving the sea \u017d. 14 anemone Aiptasia pallida Verrill. The release of fixed carbon from isolated zooxanthellae was measured using C in 30 min experiments. Zooxanthellae in filtered seawater alone released approximately 5% of photosynthate irrespective of host feeding history. When we used a 10-kDa ultrafiltrate of A. pallida host tissue as a source of HRF, approximately 14% of photosynthate was released to the medium. This increased to over 25% for zooxanthellae from anemones starved for 29 days or more. The cell-specific photosynthetic rate declined with starvation in these filtrate experiments, but the decline was offset by the increased percentage release. Indeed, the total amount of released photosynthate remained unchanged, or even increased, as zooxanthellae became more nutrient deficient. Similar trends were also observed when zooxanthellae from A. pallida were incubated in a 3-kDa ultrafiltrate of the coral Montastraea annularis, suggesting that HRF in the different filtrates operated in a similar manner. Our results support the suggestion that HRF diverts surplus carbon away from storage compounds to translocated compounds such as glycerol.",

H\u00f8egh-Guldberg, 1990; Grant et al., 1997 . It is not clear, though, whether this arises from increased glycerol synthesis or from diversion of glycerol away from triglyceride synthesis. Certainly, given that 14 C-glycerol release can be detected within 30 min of labeling, it is unlikely that released glycerol originates from the hydrolysis of existing triglyceride stores.",

Muller-Parker et al., 1996 , this decrease was counterbalanced by the actions of HRF. Indeed, we have demonstrated that HRF activity interacts with nutrient-limitation to promote the release of photosynthate by isolated zooxanthellae. Such interaction could have important ecological consequences should it occur in hospite. In particular, corals dominate in nutrient-poor tropical seas, where the availability of nitrogen to zooxanthel-\u017d lae is limited H\u00f8egh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989;  . Muscatine et al., 1989 , leading to pronounced \u017d . nitrogen-deficiency Cook et al., 1994 . Under these circumstances, zooxanthellae may readily translocate photosynthate to their host. In comparison, A. pallida is common in sub-tropical habitats that are relatively high in nutrients and \u017d . food Davy and Cook, personal observation , and its zooxanthellae show only moderate nitrogen \u017d deficiency under field conditions Cook et al., . 1992 . Moreover, sea anemones tend to be voracious predators, while a number of zooxanthellate sea anemones are found at high latitudes where seawater nutrient levels are far in excess of those \u017d found in coral reef waters reviewed by Muller-. Parker and Davy, 2001 . Consequently, these hosts may receive less photosynthetically-fixed carbon from their zooxanthellae than do reef corals. Certainly, the percent translocation values for zooxanthellae from well-fed A. pallida are very low when compared to other values in Fig. 1c , as well \u017d as various published values e.g. Muscatine, 1967;  . Sutton and H\u00f8egh-Guldberg, 1990 . It should be noted though, that factors other than nutrient availability, especially temperature and light regime, may also influence translocation rates in \u017d . the field Muller-Parker and Davy, 2001 . Of course, great caution should be exercised when relating the response of isolated zooxanthellae to the situation in the intact symbiosis. One point that should be stressed is that, at present, there is no direct evidence for the operation of HRF in intact symbioses. Vigorous homogenization, as was employed in this study, de-\u017d stroys the structure of host cells Muscatine et al., . 1994 . It is therefore likely that the environment provided by a tissue extract is rather different from that provided by an intact host. In addition, typical HRF experiments may be complicated by physiological changes occurring to zooxanthellae \u017d . upon isolation from the host Goiran et al., 1997 . The likelihood that some responses of FIZ are artefacts is suggested by our work with intact A. pallida. This has shown that the percentage of photosynthate translocated by zooxanthellae in hospite remains constant at approximately 16% when anemones are starved, under identical conditions to those used in the present study, for up \u017d to 3 months Davy and Cook submitted; see Fig. . 1c and Fig. 2c for contrast with FIZ . This could \u017d indicate that the regulation mechanism HRF-re-. lated or otherwise , as well as other physiological events, differ between isolated zooxanthellae and those still inside the host. This point is also suggested by zooxanthellae from the giant clam Tridacna crocea, which predominantly release glycerol in isolation, but release glucose in the intact \u017d . association Ishikura et al., 1999 . The resolution of this controversial matter will ultimately depend on the accurate identification of the HRF \u017d . molecule s and the demonstration of its activity in hospite.",

The data are consistent with HRF-induced carbon release by isolated zooxan-( ) thellae, where carbon is diverted from intracellular stores to the synthesis of compounds such as \u017d glycerol Hinde, 1988; Sutton and H\u00f8egh-Guld-. berg, 1990; Grant et al., 1997 . However, data concerning the nature of storage pools, and the combined influence of nitrogen-supply and HRF upon these pools, are needed to confirm this interpretation. Likewise, our findings may have important implications for the ecological success of zooxanthellate invertebrates, but work on the operation of HRF in the intact symbiosis is essential before the true ecological importance of our findings can be determined. We therefore urge continued research on the character and operation of HRF.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs can experience extreme salinity changes, particularly hypo-salinity, as a result of storms, heavy rainy seasons (e.g., monsoons), and coastal runoff. Field and laboratory observations have documented that corals exposed to hypo-saline conditions can undergo extensive bleaching and mortality. There is controversy in the literature as to whether hypo-saline conditions induce a pathological response in corals, and if there is a relationship between decreasing salinity treatment and pathological responses. To test the hypothesis that hypo-salinity exposure does not have a pathological effect on coral, we used histological and cellular diagnostic methods to characterize the pathology in hypo-salinity-exposed corals. Colonies of Stylophora pistillata were exposed to five salinity concentrations [39 parts per thousand (ppt), 32 ppt, 28 ppt, 24 ppt, and 20 ppt] that may realistically occur on a reef. Histological examination indicated an increasing severity of pathomorphologies associated with decreasing salinity, including increased tissue swelling, degradation and loss of zooxanthellae, and tissue necrosis. Pulse-amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorimetry kinetics demonstrated a decreasing photosynthetic efficiency with decreasing salinity conditions. Cytochrome P450 levels were affected by even slight changes in salinity concentration suggesting that detoxification pathways, as well as several endocrine pathways, may be adversely affected. Finally, these studies demonstrated that hypo-saline conditions can induce an oxidative-stress response in both the host and in its algal symbiont, and in so doing, may synergistically increase oxidative-stress burdens. As with other types of environmental stresses, exposure to hypo-saline conditions may have long-term consequences on coral physiology.",

                "text": "Coral reefs can experience extreme changes in salinity of varying duration. Storms, heavy rainy seasons (e.g., monsoons), hurricanes, and coastal runoff can significantly alter surface and depth salinity (Coles and Jokiel, 1992; Devlin et al., 1998; Orr and Moorehouse, 1933; Porter et al., 1999) . Over the short term, haloclines of less than 14 ppt can form over in-shore reefs that are quickly dispelled within a few days after heavy rains (Devlin et al., 1998) . Long-term exposure to hypo-saline conditions on coral reefs is not uncommon. For example, decreased salinity levels (28-32 ppt) existed for almost a month on coral reefs located centrally on the Great Barrier Reef after heavy storms (Devlin et al., 1998) . Studies dating back to 1933, indicate that hypo-salinity is a significant environmental factor that may impact a coral reef and influence the distribution of cnidarian species and populations (Berkelmans and Oliver, 1999; Cloud, 1952; Goreau, 1964; Orr and Moorehouse, 1933) . Bleaching and mortality of near-shore corals and anemones are often reported in association with hypo-saline conditions resulting from heavy rainfall events (Berkelmans and Oliver, 1999; Cloud, 1952; Goreau, 1964; Egana and DiSalvo, 1982; Hendy et al., 2003; Lirman et al., 2008; Orr and Moorehouse, 1933; Van Woesik et al., 1995) . In the laboratory, hyposalinity induced bleaching in corals and anemones is an established phenomenon characterized by pathologies, including reduced photosynthetic efficiency and altered metabolism of respiratory pathways (Engebretson and Martin, 1994; Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989; Moberg et al., 1997; Tytlianov et al., 2000) . These metabolic pathologies can in turn influence higher-order physiological diseases, such as gamete abnormalities and reduced viabilities, significantly affecting fecundity (Richmond, 1993) .",

                "text": "Corals are osmo-conformers, becoming iso-osmotic with their surroundings, gaining water when exposed to hypo-saline conditions (Rankin and Davenport, 1981; Tytlianov et al., 2000) . Hypotonic conditions can cause damage within a number of different organelles and cellular fractions (Jahnke and White, 2003; Maeda and Thompson, 1986) . Mitochondria, in particular, are among of the most vulnerable cell structures to osmotic damage; changes in osmolarity can disrupt mitochondrial electron transport and alter NADH redox capacity, producing an increase in reactive oxygen species and altering cellular metabolism (Ballantyne and Moon, 1986; Martinez et al., 1995; Shivakumar and Jayaraman, 1986) . Mitochondrial enzymes that play key roles in amino acid metabolism in invertebrates are depressed in response to hypo-saline conditions (Devin et al., 1997; Ellis et al., 1985; Moyes et al., 1986) . Osmotic shifts induce adverse changes in endoplasmic reticulum structure and lysosomal function in plant and animal cells (Nicholson, 2001 ). In the chloroplast, hypotonicity can inhibit photosynthetic electron transport and catalase activity (Allen 1977; Asada 1999; Burdon et al., 1996; Lockau, 1979) . Hypo-tonicity has been shown to block induction of the heat-shock protein response in hepatocytes, thus reducing their ability to deal with stress (Kurz et al., 1998) . In contrast to higher invertebrate and vertebrate pathologies associated with hypo-saline conditions, there have been few studies that examine the physiological responses of coral to this environmental condition. The majority of these studies have focused on the effects of hypo-salinity on photosynthesis of the coral's zooxanthellae, or general respiration of coral symbiosis (Alutoin et al., 2001; Kershwell and Jones 2004; Manzello and Lirman, 2003) .",

The CCA provided an objective statistical tool for (1) determining if populations are different from one another using sets of cellular biomarkers that are indicative of a cellular process (e.g., protein chaperoning and degradation, xenobiotic response), and (2) which biomarkers contributed to those differences. This analysis required combining data from all five treatments into one matrix, which we did by expressing biomarker responses in a given treatment as a proportion of their mean levels.",

Ferrochelatase is a~40-48 ku protein and is often expressed as two isoforms in invertebrates as well as in Nematostella (Fig 1G) (Dailey, 1990; Putnam et al., 2007; Shibahara et al., 2007) .

Antibody to the cnidarian glutathione peroxidase was raised against the conserved domain containing the selenocystene reactive site, which is found in a number of glutathione peroxidase isoforms, as indicated in the triple banding pattern in Fig. 1M (Brigelius-Floh, 1999; Putnam et al., 2007) .

Cnidarian anti-oxidant defenses were very responsive to the small changes in salinity, and their induction preceded detectable changes in protein oxidation. In contrast, the DNA repair enzyme, MutY, only accumulated at the lowest salinity concentration. Dinoflagellate antioxidant enzymes responded in a similar fashion as the cnidarian antioxidant enzymes, except that at 20 ppt, dinoflagellate Cu/ZnSOD protein levels either decreased to a point where the protein levels were below the calibrant standard curve or the epitope that is recognized by the antibody had been masked (e.g., adduction with an aldehyde such as 4-hydroxynonenal or oxidized). DNA damage as reflected by the accumulation of DNA abasic lesions (apurinic/apyrimidinic site) on DNA more than tripled when corals were exposed to 28 ppt salinity, and increased by almost seven fold when exposed to 20 ppt salinity (Table 1) . Canonical correlation analysis showed a significant shift in anti-oxidant defenses and an accumulation of biochemical lesions associated with oxidative damage from exposure to a decreasing salinity regime, and that the 24-20 ppt treatment was defined predominantly by accumulation of these cellular lesions ( Fig. 2B ; Wilks' Lambda value = 0.0001228, F Test b 0.0001). ELISA for cnidarian ferrochelatase, protoporphyrinogen oxidase IX (PPO) and Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO1) were performed to assay differences in porphyrin metabolism between the salinity treatments.

Dark-adapted F v /F m in Stylophora pistillata measured using a DIVING-PAM chlorophyll fluorometer. All measurements were performed using the leaf distance clip, following 24 h of exposure to the different salinities, and after dark-adapting all coral fragments for 1 h. n = 4-7 replicates per treatment, +/\u2212 SE. in any of these processes are indicative of a significant change in cellular metabolism and homeostasis (Downs, 2005) . In this study, only six parameters of protein chaperoning and degradation in cnidarians and two parameters in the dinoflagellate were examined, but whose changes in behavior are indicative of a wider system response. Thus, these biomarkers were used to test the hypothesis that hypo-saline conditions significantly shifted the concentration of these parameters. Heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a cytosolic chaperonin, while Grp75 is the mitochondrial homologue. The cytosolic Hsp70 function is a crucial element in the maturation of newly made proteins to gain their active state. GRP75 is essential in the maturation of newly imported proteins into the mitochondria. The ability to reassemble denatured proteins is often the most commonly recognized function of both Hsp70 and Grp75 (Ellis, 1996; Papp et al., 2003) . Cnidarian heatshock protein 60 (Hsp60) is the major mitochondrial chaperonin and functions to mature nuclear-encoded, mitochondrial-imported proteins into their active state (Ellis, 1996) . Elevation of this protein signifies that there has been a general shift in the protein chaperoning and degradation within the mitochondria and implies a change in the equilibria of mitochondrial-associated metabolic pathways (Papp et al., 2003) . The dinoflagellate Hsp60 homologue is better known as the RuBisCO-binding protein and was first discovered to chaperone RuBisCO, the primary enzyme of the Calvin Cycle in photosynthesis (Hemmingsen, 1990; Jackson-Constan et al., 2001 ). Ubiquitin could be considered the 'death mark' of proteins; its conjugation to broken or no-longer-needed proteins marks these proteins for degradation (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998) . Ubiquitin activase E1 prepares and mediates the conjugation catalysis event between ubiquitin and the target protein and an increase in activity suggests amplification of protein degradation processes (Shang et al., 1997) .",

Each of these sHsps is independently regulated and localizes to different places within the cell, and perhaps to different tissue types (Branton et al., 1999; De Jong et al., 1993; Heckathorn et al., 1999; Morrow et al., 2004; Willsie and Clegg, 2002) . The chloroplast sHsp specifically associates with the oxygen evolving complex of Photosystem II and protects Photosystem II activity during heat stress, ultraviolet-radiation exposure, and oxidative stress, most likely via a recycling anti-oxidant mechanism (Downs et al., 1999; Heckathorn et al., 1999) .",

The first proteins to respond to the change in salinity were Hsp60 and ubiquitin activase. Lack of induction of Hsp70, ubiquitin, and the sHsps at 32 ppt suggests that the organism was responding to a stressor, but was not responding to a cellular crisis (a condition defined by the presence of cellular lesions) (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999) . For example, neither protein carbonyl, nor DNA damage, was evident at this salinity. This is supported by histological evidence that showed only slight changes in cellular architecture at this salinity. On the other hand, all the host biomarkers for protein chaperoning and degradation at 28 ppt were significantly elevated in comparison to controls, indicating a marked shift in cellular condition. This condition is marked by an accumulation of cellular lesions, specifically oxidized proteins and damage to DNA, likely the result of nucleotide oxidation. The effects of this treatment were morphologically evident in the widespread changes to coral tissue and cellular architecture. Specific changes were evidenced by the nuclear rounding and cell degradation. At 24 ppt, there is an increase in tissue degradation with a significant accumulation of the sHsps, indicating a serious alteration of metabolic structures and processes (Ornatsky et al., 1995) . Grp75 levels were reduced at 24 ppt and 20 ppt, which may have been a result of the mitochondrial-import rate being adversely affected by oxidative and osmotic stress (Papp and Nardai, 2003; Takahashi and Hood, 1996) . For the dinoflagellate, Hsp60 chaperonin did not significantly accumulate until exposure to 28 ppt salinity. Together, these individual responses form a diagnostic profile showing that decreasing salinity regimes will shift protein chaperoning and degradation from a situation characterized by a coordinated increase in the rate of protein synthesis and protein degradation to a metabolic condition with a significant increase in the rate of protein degradation relative to protein synthesis (Ellis, 1996; Downs, 2005; Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998) .",

Canonical correlation analysis showed a significant shift in antioxidant defenses and an accumulation of cellular lesions associated with oxidative damage from exposure to a decreasing salinity regime (Fig. 2B) . The enzymes that respond to the 32 ppt salinity exposure were catalase, dinoflagellate Cu/ZnSOD, and MnSOD, indicating that hypo-salinity induced an oxidative-stress response, but no major change in tissue morphologies was visible. Protein oxidation was not apparent until exposure to 28 ppt salinity when tissue breakdown was widespread and cellular debris was prevalent in both the epidermis and gastrodermal tissues (Fig. 4) . Induction of MutY was not apparent until 20 ppt salinity, even though DNA AP lesions significantly accumulated at higher salinities. One explanation for this result is that MutY repair activity can increase without an increase in accumulation of the enzyme. Thus the concentration of MutY at 28 and 24 ppt salinity may have been sufficient to repair oxidized base pairs. The accumulation of DNA lesions at 20 ppt may have been so severe that it overwhelmed the basal capacity of MutY to repair the DNA lesions.",

Shifts in the porphyrin metabolic equilibrium reflect a major shift in cellular metabolism as a whole (Marks et al., 1982; Thunell and Harper 2000) . Protoporphryinogen oxidase IX catalyzes the penultimate step of porphyrin production and ferrochelatase the last step, inserts iron into the porphyrin ring to form hemin (Dailey, 1990; Dailey et al., 2000) . Heme Oxygenase I catalyzes the decomposition of heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and ferrous iron (Schwartsburd, 2001) . Biliverdin is further catalyzed to bilirubin, which is a powerful lipophilic anti-oxidant (Stocker and Ames, 1987) . Interestingly, the porphyrin synthesis pathway was unaltered by hypo-salinity exposure as indicated by a lack of change in both ferrochelatase and protoporphryinogen oxidase IX ( Fig. 2C ; Table 1 ). The porphyrin degradation pathway however was altered when corals were exposed to salinities of 24 ppt and lower, though most likely not in response to damaged porphyrins, but rather from a need to increase bilirubin's anti-oxidant potential (Stocker and Ames, 1987) .",

During the 1998 bleaching event in the Florida Keys, F v /F m values of bleached corals ranged between 0.35 and 0.47 (Warner et al., 1999) . Although a relatively short-duration stress experiment, PAM measurements in our experiment indicate that zooxanthellae exposed to anything less than 28 ppt suffered severe damage to their algal photosynthetic apparatus, leading to impairment of photosynthesis. This is in agreement with a recent study by Kershwell and Jones (2004) who showed that a significant decrease of F v /F m values occurred only at salinities of 26 ppt or lower (10 ppt lower than ambient).",

This inference is also supported by Hoegh- Guldberg and Smith (1989) who showed no effect on oxygen flux and biomass of zooxanthellae in S. pistillata from the Great Barrier Reef maintained at a salinity of 5 ppt lower than ambient salinity. They did find, though, that corals exposed to 23 ppt (12 ppt lower than ambient) all died following a 36-hour exposure. The S. pistillata colonies in this study showed similar changes; there were no discernible macrochanges in corals exposed to salinities of 7 ppt below ambient (i.e., 32 ppt), however, histological and cellular parameter changes were observed. Exposure of fragments to lower salinities (i.e., below 28 ppt) for 24 h did result in extreme biochemical and histological changes accompanied by extreme degradation and necrosis. This suggests that the possibility of recuperation following such an osmotic shock may be relatively low and that the range of salinities in which these corals may osmo-conform is relatively narrow. Since S. pistillata colonies found in the northern Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat) (average yearly rainfall approximately 3 cm/year) are not usually exposed to low salinities, it is not surprising that these corals have minimal tolerance to drastic and prolonged changes in salinity. The histological changes occurring in zooxanthellae and coral cells corroborate the results obtained by the PAM fluorescence and biomarkers of cellular metabolism.",

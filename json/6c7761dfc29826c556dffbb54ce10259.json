                "text": "Cyanobacteria are a group of gram-negative photosynthetic, oxygen-evolving prokaryotes broadly distributed in the terrestrial and aquatic environments on Earth and are considered to be important contributors to the photosynthetic biomass production. They are present even in extreme habitats, such as high or low temperatures, highly basic or acidic pH, desiccation, and high salt concentrations [1] . Because of their unique survival strategies acquired during evolution, the cyanobacteria thrive under harsh environmental conditions. For instance, compatible solutes, such as sucrose, trehalose, glucosylglycerol, and glycine betaine, are accumulated in cyanobacterial cells during the acclimation of cyanobacteria to salt stress conditions, particularly salt and drought stress [2] . Besides, the cyanobacteria are simultaneously exposed to visible radiation and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in their habitats during absorption of solar energy for photosynthesis. In particular, high-altitude environment is thought to be one of the extreme habitats subjected to strong UVR. In the Alps, it was reported that the UVB radiation increases by $19% per 1000m altitude [3] . To date, several studies have revealed the existence of diverse cyanobacterial species in high-altitude lakes located at altitudes of 2400-6400 m [4, 5] . The highly energetic UVR causes cell damage triggered by both direct effects on DNA and proteins and indirect effects via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [6] . To avoid the toxic effects of UVR, it is known that the cyanobacteria are able to synthesize compounds, which confer protection against the UVR. Among these compounds, we place special emphasis on mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) as a natural cyanobacterial UV sunscreen in this review chapter.",

                "text": "MAAs offer a great potential for the development of novel UV sunscreens because of their direct and indirect protective properties. Previous studies provided the evidence that MAAs are capable of protecting cyanobacteria by absorbing harmful UV range wavelengths [7] . Moreover, in addition to UV-absorbing properties, evidence is accumulating that MAAs possess other physiological functions, such as antioxidative, scavengers of toxic oxygen radicals (ROS), and as an osmoprotectant [8] . These characteristics indicate MAAs to be a promising candidate for natural sunscreen(s) and with pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. In this chapter, we describe several important aspects of cyanobacterial MAAs, from essential features to potential applications. Furthermore, recent patents related to MAAs are also reviewed. Since the research publications by global research groups have increased tremendously in last 2 decades [9] , the interest in MAAs is thought to be growing markedly. In particular, according to the number of published articles in PubMed, cyanobacteria are the most investigated MAAs producing organisms including eukaryotic algae, invertebrates, vertebrates, dinoflagellates, bacteria, and yeast, during 2001-16 [9] . In addition, because of their photoautotrophic and transformable properties and availability of genome sequences, cyanobacteria have gained much attention as attractive biofactories for the production of beneficial natural products. This chapter will impart knowledge to the readers on cyanobacterial MAAs starting from detailed basic observations to very recent developments in various commercial fields.",

                "text": "Mycosporine is a group of nitrogenous water-soluble metabolites, which were reported as compounds associated with light-stimulated sporulation in terrestrial fungi [10] . In 1965, Leach found the presence of UV-absorbing (l max \u00bc 310 nm) compound named P-310 in fungi when sporulation was induced by near-UV irradiation [11] . Later, Favre-Bonvin et al. chemically identified the first substance of P-310 as 2-methoxy-3-bis(hydroxymethyl)methylamino-5-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-2-cyclohexene-1-one (mycosporine-serinol) [12] . In the molecular structure of mycosporine-serinol, the structural analogue to amino acid serine, serinol, is conjugated to a cyclohexenone ring ( Fig. 5.1 ). \"Mycosporine\" is a common name of the fungal metabolites, which have UV absorption and substituted with amino acid residues [10] . In 1969, Shibata found UV-absorbing compounds in aqueous extracts of six zooxanthellate scleractinian corals (five Acropora and one Pocillopora species) and a cyanobacterium in the Great Barrier Reef [13] . This material, named S-320, showed a broad UV absorption maximum at approximately 320 nm. Subsequently S-320 was identified as a family of mycosporine derivatives. These compounds have been grouped as MAAs [14] . A more detailed historical context for discovery of MAAs has been well presented in previous review papers [15, 16] . MAAs are characterized by a cyclohexenone or cyclohexenimine ring as the core chromophore structure that has a methoxy moiety in C2 position. C3 position on the ring structure of MAAs is commonly substituted with an amino compound, while C1 position is substituted with either an oxo or an imino moiety. For example, in the structure of shinorine, which is one of the major MAAs in cyanobacteria, glycine, and serine bind to C3 and C1 positions of core chromophore ring structure, respectively. The details of their chemical structure and biosynthesis are mentioned later in this chapter. In Fig. 5 .1, examples of the molecular structure of mycosporine and MAAs are shown. To date, more than 20 different MAAs have been identified.",

MAAs are synthesized in various organisms, such as micro-and macroalgae, eukaryotic phytoplankton, fungi, and cyanobacteria [16, 21] .

Although MAAs can be detected in animals, it is believed that they do not produce these compounds directly. Accumulating evidence reveals that animals take up MAAs through the food chain or from symbiotic microorganisms [1] . However, Shinzato et al. reported the presence of gene cluster homologs to cyanobacterial MAA synthetic genes in coral and sea anemones, therefore de novo synthesis of MAAs in these animals might be possible [24] . In addition, Osborn et al. demonstrated that vertebrates could synthesize the MAAs related compound, gadusol [25] .",

                "text": "In cyanobacteria, shinorine is known as the most dominant MAA. Various MAAs, such as porphyra-334, mycosporine-glycine have also been reported so far. Shinorine has been detected in various cyanobacterial species, such as Chlorogloeopsis PCC 6912 [26] , Scytonema sp. [27] , Nodularia (Nodularia baltica, Nodularia harveyana, and Nodularia spumigena) [28] , Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 [29] , Anabaena doliolum [30] , N. commune [31] , and M. aeruginosa [32] . Among these cyanobacteria, Scytonema sp. and A. variabilis accumulated shinorine as a sole MAA, while it has been reported that the remaining strains accumulated other MAAs in addition to shinorine. Chlorogloeopsis accumulated mycosporine-glycine together with shinorine after UVB exposure [26] . In three Nodularia strains, porphyra-334 was the more dominant MAA than shinorine before and after UVB irradiation [28] . In A. doliolum, shinorine and porphyra-334 were detected only under UV irradiation condition, while mycosporine-glycine was produced constitutively [30] . In N. commune, Sinha et al. detected only shinorine [31] . Later, Sakamoto's group characterized glycosylated MAAs from this desiccant cyanobacterium. These are 1050-Da MAA with two distinct chromophores of 3-aminocyclohexen-1-one and 1,3-diaminocyclohexen [33] , hexose-bound palythine-threonine derivatives [34] , 7-O-(b-arabinopyranosyl)-porphyra-334 [35] , pentose-bound shinorine [35] , and hexose-bound porphyra-334 [35] , together with porphyra-334 [35] . Genetic differences of N. commune used in these studies caused different accumulation pattern of MAAs. Glycosylated MAAs in N. commune are supposed to be localized in the extracellular matrix [35] . M. aeruginosa accumulated shinorine for >95% of total MAAs compared to only a small amount of porphyra-334 [32] . It should be noted that a recent study using M. aeruginosa strain PCC 7806 detected shinorine but not porphyra-334 [23] . In addition to these MAAs, asterina-330, palythene, and palythinol were also reported as the usual cyanobacterial MAAs [36] . On the other hand, halophilic cyanobacterium Euhalothece sp., which exists in the upper layer of gypsum crust of a hypersaline pond, was reported to produce mycosporine-2-glycine together with euhalothece-362 [6] . It is also known that a halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica can synthesize mycosporine-2-glycine as the sole MAA [21] . Moreover, three MAAs, mycosporine-taurine, dehydroxylusujirene, and M-343, have been characterized in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 [37] . In this cyanobacterium, mycosporine-tau synthesis was induced by both UVA and UVB exposure, while synthesis of dehydroxylusujirene and M-343 was induced only under UVA exposure. However, according to the experiments conducted by Singh et al., the identity of these unusual MAAs in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is questionable [38] . In addition to the compounds mentioned earlier, various other cyanobacterial MAAs, including those not yet characterized, have been reported so far [39] .",

                "text": "MAAs generally consist of a cyclohexenone or cyclohexenimine ring. Among the MAAs illustrated in Fig. 5 .1, mycosporine-glycine, having absorption maxima at 310 nm [36] , possesses a cyclohexenone ring in which C3 position is linked with an amino acid, glycine. Monosubstituted MAAs like mycosporine-glycine are called as oxocarbonyl-MAAs, and found in many organisms [40] . In cyanobacteria, for example, mycosporine-taurine and mycosporine-g-aminobutyric acid (mycosporine-GABA) were recently reported as oxocarbonyl-MAAs [35, 41] . Mycosporine-glycine is a common intermediate for the bioproduction of disubstituted MAAs such as shinorine, porphyra-334, and mycosporine-2-glycine [40] . In the synthesis of disubstituted MAAs, usually a second amino acid, amino alcohol, or enaminone system is conjugated to the C1 position of mycosporine-glycine, with few exceptions [36] . The absorption maxima of disubstituted MAAs vary from 320 to 362 nm, depending on the nitrogen substituents. Further modifications of the amino acid group of some MAAs by condensation, dehydration, decarboxylation, oxidation, reduction, sulfonation, and glycosylation are also known [40] . In cyanobacteria, as aforementioned, several glycosylated MAAs have been identified in N. commune by a Japanese research group [33] [34] [35] . Most recently, this group revealed that the edible cyanobacterium Nostoc sphaericum contained glycosylated MAAs, 13-O-b-galactosyl-porphyra-334 (b-Gal-P334), and hexosyl-shinorine, together with porphyra-334 [42] . They demonstrated that b-Gal-P334 might play an important role in stress tolerant mechanism in N. sphaericum and has a potential for use as an ingredient in cosmetics and toiletries. Furthermore, another group discovered hexose-bound derivatives of shinorine and palythine-serine as glycosylated MAAs in two strains of the cyanobacterium Scytonema cf. crispum [43] .",

                "text": "Among MAAs characterized so far, only the molecular structure of palythine [44] and palythene [45] was confirmed by X-ray crystal analysis over 35 years ago. In the crystal, palythine existed as a zwitterion, which was stabilized by resonance between two canonical structures [44] . The palythine and water molecules are associated by hydrogen bonding, forming a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded structure [44] . Palythene was also clarified as a zwitterion in which the positive and negative charges were favorable to exist in the near position to each other. Two canonical structures are thought to contribute to a resonance hybrid structure of palythene [45] . The canonical structures and resonant hybrid structure of palythine and palythene are shown in Fig. 5 .2. Following that the entire stereostructure of porphyra-334 was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations [46] . NMR chemical shift which was assignable to imine carbon of porphyra-334 was consistent with the result of DFT calculations using the imino nitrogen-protonated form of porphyra-334. A very high proton affinity (265.7 kcal/mol) of lone pairs on imine nitrogen suggested that porphyra-334 could be a proton sponge [46] . Thus, the nitrogen atom at the imine group of MAAs appears to be protonated to form zwitterion, and resulting conjugation causes delocalization of the positive charge on a nitrogen atom over the chromophore. The extensive conjugation of MAAs facilitates absorption of UV. The degree of resonance delocalization in MAA molecules influences the position of their absorption maximum and extinction coefficient [36] . The higher extinction coefficient of MAAs is caused by the more efficient p-electron delocalization in a molecule [36] .",

                "text": "Although the absorption maxima of MAAs vary depending on their structure including nitrogen substituents and attached side groups, the differences might be very small, or the absorption maxima of many MAAs are identical. Further, as mentioned earlier, the value of absorption maximum of MAAs might be affected by some environmental factors, such as the pH. Taking into account these facts, it is difficult to identify MAAs by only analyzing their absorption spectra. Therefore, comparing the retention time of the target compounds with authentic standards by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, with either reversed-phase octadecylsilica (C18) or octylsilica (C8) columns has been often used so far. The classical HPLC method was based on C18 column and isocratic elution mode with mobile phase containing 0.02% acetic acid [50] . Seven of the nine MAAs known at the time could be separated by this method. To date, many HPLC methods for separation of MAAs have been reported, and there are several papers summarizing some of them [36, 51] . In addition to the retention time in HPLC analysis, information on the molecular weight of target compounds by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis including liquid chromatography (LC)-MS has been used for the identification of MAAs. Resolving the composition of MAAs by analyzing hydrolyzed amino acids also has contributed toward identifying their structure. For example, a MAA compound synthesized in the halotolerant cyanobacterium A. halophytica was characterized as mycosporine-2-glycine by the combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and amino acid analyses [21] . On the other hand, characterization of novel and atypical MAAs is not easy and requires several ordered analytical experiments. For example, the 478-Da MAA in N. commune with an absorption maximum at 335 nm was identified by using multiple analytical methods. At first, the molecular mass was determined by MALDI-TOF MS analysis, and second, the data from infrared (IR) spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF MS/MS, and NMR analyses suggested that the 478-Da MAA was a porphyra-334 derivative bound to pentose [33] . Third, the released pentose from hydrolyzed 478-Da MAA was determined to be an arabinose by gas chromatography (GC)-MS analysis, and this MAA was finally characterized as 7-O-(b-arabinopyranosyl)-porphyra-334 [35] . Thus, using the appropriate and reliable analytical instruments in combination has been effective for the characterization of MAAs. In addition, further technological innovation, such as improvement of sensitivity of analytical equipments, will also help promote the discovery of new MAAs which exist in very small amounts in the organism. These analytical equipments include next-generation MS. For example, electrospray ionization, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), and surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI). Combining different instrumentations as hyphenated devices, such as CE-MS (capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry), HPLC-MS (high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry), or HPLC-NMR (high-performance liquid chromatography-nuclear magnetic resonance), is one of the most promising ways in the discovery of novel MAAs.",

                "text": "The common precursor compound for the synthesis of mycosporines and MAAs is 4-deoxygadusol (4-DG). Shikimate pathway is believed to be the major 4-DG synthesis pathway due to the following observations. First, an incorporation experiment using radiolabelled compounds revealed that 3-dehydroquinate (DHQ), a shikimate pathway intermediate, was the precursor of cyclohexenone ring of mycosporines in the anamorphic fungus Trichothecium roseum [52] . Second, Portwich and Garcia-Pichel demonstrated the incorporation of radiolabelled pyruvate, which can be converted to one of the precursors of the shikimate pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), resulted in labeling of the cyclohexenone ring of MAAs in cyanobacterium Chlorogloeopsis sp. strain PCC 6912 [53] . Third, these authors reported that the synthesis of MAAs was inhibited by addition of tyrosine, which acts as a feedback inhibitor of the shikimate pathway, in Chlorogloeopsis sp. [53] . Fourth, synthesis of MAAs in the coral Stylophora pistillata was inhibited by glyphosate, a shikimate pathway-specific inhibitor [54] . In 2010, based on genome mining, two genes in cyanobacterium A. variabilis ATCC29413, Ava_3858 (predicted DHQ synthase-DHQS) and Ava_3857 (O-methyltransferase-O-MT), were proposed as factors which might be responsible for production of 4-DG via 3-DHQ [38] . The combination of genes corresponding to Ava_3858 and Ava_3857 was not found in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301 [38] . MAAs could not be detected in these three cyanobacterial strains in that study [38] ; and therefore, these two genes were thought to be specific to MAA synthesis. On the other hand, almost simultaneously, a different 4-DG synthesis pathway was reported by Balskus and Walsh [55] . They conducted in vitro experiments using the translated products of the genes in cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC29133, NpR5600 and NpR5599, which are homologous to Ava_3858 and Ava_3857, respectively [55] . Their experiments revealed that NpR5600 and NpR5599 proteins did not produce 4-DG from 3-DHQ, in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), nicotineamideadenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), and Co 2+ . On the contrary, these proteins could produce 4-DG from sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (SHP), the intermediate of pentose phosphate pathway [55] . This result demonstrated that cyanobacterial MAAs could be synthesized from SHP. In fact, the NpR5600 protein resembles DHQS homolog 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (EVS), which is an enzyme that converts SHP to 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone, rather than a canonical DHQS [55] , although DHQS and EVS belong to the same superfamily of enzymes [56] . Thus, two possible biosynthetic pathways of 4-DG by DHQS/EVS and O-MT have been proposed so far ( Fig. 5.3 ). In addition, and interestingly, it has been reported that knockout of the Ava_3858 gene did not result in a loss of ability to synthesize shinorine in A. variabilis [57] , indicating redundancy of DHQS/EVS in this cyanobacterium. Specific inhibition of the shikimate pathway by glyphosate or L-phenylalanine in Ava_3858 knockout mutant revealed that both the pentose phosphate pathway and the shikimate pathway are associated in MAA production in A. variabilis [58] . On the other hand, the knockout mutant of Ava_3857 gene did not show any marked induction of shinorine by UVA exposure in A. variabilis [58] . This result suggests that O-MT in the MAA synthetic gene cluster is indispensable for MAA production in cyanobacteria.",

The protein product of Ava_3856 was confirmed to convert 4-DG to mycosporine-glycine. In this reaction, 4-DG is phosphorylated depending on ATP, and then ligated with glycine [55] .

                "text": "NRPSs are known to form peptide bonds outside the ribosomal machinery. The Ava_3855 protein produced shinorine from mycosporineglycine by attachment of the serine moiety in vitro and in Escherichia coli cells [55] . During this conversion reaction, Ava_3855 is supposed to activate serine carboxylate to form imine [55] . The four genes, Ava_3858, Ava_3857, Ava_3856, and Ava_3855, are recognized as the gene cluster responsible for shinorine synthesis in A. variabilis ( Fig. 5.4) . Besides, the clusters, four genes in cyanobacteria N. punctiforme (NpR5600, NpR5599, NpR5598, and NpR5597) [55, 59] , A. halophytica (Ap3858, Ap3857, Ap3856, and Ap3855) [21] , and M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 (mysA, mysB, mysC, and mysD) [23] have also been characterized to produce MAAs so far ( Fig. 5.4 ). In A. halophytica, a gene Ap3858, homologous to Ava_3858, was not found in the upper region of Ap3857, but found at the distant end. The Ap3858 protein also contained an additional functionally unknown N-terminal domain. Heterologous expression of A. halophytica gene cluster in E. coli cells resulted in the production of mycosporine-2-glycine, not shinorine [21] . Therefore, the last step of MAA biosynthesis by the fourth protein might cause different attachment of amino acid residues. Furthermore, in contrast to A. variabilis, the fourth gene of these cyanobacteria (NpR5597/Ap3855/mysD) encodes for D-Ala-D-Ala ligase, and especially in N. punctiforme, the direction of NpR5597 transcription is opposite that of NpR5600, NpR5599, and NpR5598 [55, 59] . In cyanobacteria, the fourth gene homologous to D-Ala-D-Ala ligase is more common than that homologous to NPRS [17] . Biochemical characterization of the function of NRPSs and D-Ala-D-Ala ligases would be interesting to clarify. In addition, redundant genes that might be responsible for the conjugation of nitrogen substituents were found in some cyanobacterial species [55, 60] . In Cylindrospermum stagnale PCC 7417, the gene cluster for MAA synthesis consists of five unusual genes, mylA, mylB, mylC, mylD, and mylE [60] . These genes encode for putative proteins responsible for EVS (mylA), O-MT (mylB), D-Ala-D-Ala ligase (mylC), and ATP-grasp (mylD and mylE) ( Fig. 5.4 ). Heterologous expression of these five genes in E. coli resulted in the bioproduction of rare MAAs, mycosporine-ornithine, and mycosporine-lysine. Future studies of the unusual MAA synthetic genes like mylA-mylE in C. stagnale PCC 7417 will give additional new insights into the cyanobacterial MAA synthetic pathway. Genes homologous to cyanobacterial MAA synthetic genes have also been found in fungi, actinobacteria, dinoflagellates, sea anemones, and corals [24, 55, 61] . In fungi, the fourth gene encoding NRPS/D-Ala-D-Ala ligase was not found in their genomic DNA sequence, consistent with their property for production of monosubstituted mycosporines. On the other hand, in two actinobacteria, Actinosynnema mirum DSM 43827 and Pseudonocardia sp. strain P1, a complete set of gene cluster homologous to cyanobacteria was discovered [62] . The ability of these gene clusters for MAA production was confirmed by heterologous expression in Streptomyces avermitilis SUKA22. thought to be horizontally transferred from cyanobacteria [38] . Detailed molecular analyses of genes or proteins associated with MAA production have only been conducted in cyanobacteria so far. Molecular investigation of MAAs synthetic pathway using with other organisms will be an interesting subject for future research.",

In cyanobacteria, MAA production was significantly increased by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), UVA (315-400 nm) radiation, and UVB (280-315 nm) radiation. The most effective induction by UVB radiation was shown in A. variabilis, A. doliolum, Anabaena sp., N. commune, Scytonema sp., Nodularia, and Arthrospira sp. In A. variabilis PCC 7937, the induction of shinorine was remarkably higher in cells exposed to PAR + UVA + UVB radiation than in cells exposed to only PAR or PAR + UVA radiation [29] . Similar results were observed in A. doliolum, in which mycosporine-glycine, porphyra-334, and shinorine were induced by UVB radiation [30] . Sinha et al. also demonstrated that UVB could enhance shinorine synthesis while PAR and UVA did not induce it significantly in Anabaena sp., N. commune, and Scytonema sp. [27] . In three strains of Nodularia, it has been reported that UVB radiation plays an important role in the induction process of shinorine and porphyra-334 [28] . Biosynthesis of mycosporine-glycine in Arthrospira sp. CU2556 was specifically enhanced by UVB radiation [63] . Besides cyanobacteria, the upregulation of MAAs by UVR was also observed in other organisms, such as yeast, macroalgae, and marine microalgae such as prymnesiophyte, diatoms, and dinoflagellate [64] [65] [66] [67] . Evidence for the presence and characteristics of a UVB-specific photoreceptor was presented in the cyanobacterium Chlorogleopsis PCC 6912 [68] . In that report, a pterin was proposed as a candidate for the photoreceptor because the addition of an inhibitor for pterin synthesis, N-acetylserotonin (NAS) specifically diminished the MAA content in UV stressed cells. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction or linkages to gene expression related to MAA biosynthesis remains unknown [17] . On the other hand, the possibility of MAA induction via ROS without specific photoreceptors in colonies of S. pistillata has also been proposed [69] . In addition, it was demonstrated that UVR caused synthesis and secretion of a water stress protein, WspA, in N. commune [70] . WspA was proposed as an important factor in the global stress response of this cyanobacterium via modulation of the three-dimensional extracellular matrix, especially the transport, distribution, and/or macromolecular architecture of UV-absorbing pigment complexes including MAA and scytonemin.",

Induction of MAA accumulation by salt stress was reported in some cyanobacterial species. In Chlorogloeopsis, NaCl could induce synthesis of mycosporine-glycine and shinorine with or without UVB exposure [71] . The contents of these MAAs reached their maximum at 513 mM NaCl. Moreover, other salts, Na 2 SO , KCl, and MgCl 2 also induced MAAs and had a similar effect as NaCl [71] . In A. variabilis PCC 7937, Singh et al. demonstrated that NaCl stress treatment had synergistic effects on induction of shinorine with UV exposure [29] . These authors further found that NH 4 Cl also had a significant effect on the induction of shinorine [29] . In a halotolerant cyanobacterium A. halophytica, production of mycosporine-2-glycine was significantly upregulated by exposure to 2.0 M NaCl stress condition [21] . Moreover, the expression level of all four MAA synthetic genes (Ap3858-Ap3855) was enhanced remarkably by salt stress treatment in A. halophytica cells [21] . In addition to cyanobacteria, it was recently reported that the total concentration of MAAs was increased by salt stress in the marine dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum [72] . In corals Lobophytum compactum and Sinularia flexibilis, thermal stress also enhanced the accumulation level of MAAs [16] . In contrast, high temperature did not cause an increase in the MAA accumulation in cyanobacteria Chlorogloeopsis PCC 6912 and A. variabilis PCC 7973 [29, 71] .",

Although shinorine was the sole MAA in this cyanobaterium under normal growth conditions, sulfur deficiency triggered the synthesis of palythineserine as a secondary MAA. Palythine-serine accumulation was diminished by the addition of methionine to sulfur-deficient cultures. Methionine supply also affected the conversion of mycosporine-glycine into shinorine. In addition to sulfur, nitrogen supply also affects MAAs biosynthesis. Because MAAs are nitrogenous compounds, it has been proposed that they might act as an intracellular nitrogen storage molecules [8] . In fact, in the cyanobacterium A. variabilis PCC 7973, an increase of shinorine was observed following the addition of ammonium salt [29] . It has also been reported that ammonium in combination with UVR enhanced the production of porphyra-334 and shinorine in the marine red macroalga Porphyra columbina [74] . Moreover, in a halotolerant cyanobacterium A. halophytica, nitrate availability affected MAA production in response to change of salinity [75] . Intracellular level of mycosporine-2-glycine was increased with elevated nitrate concentration at high salinity in this cyanobacterium.",

Thus, MAAs function primarily for photoprotection and as a sunscreen. Besides the photoprotective role, MAAs have antioxidant [33, 34, 76] and antiinflammatory activities [77, 78] , and occasionally participate in the osmotic equilibriums of diverse marine organisms [79] .

It is well known that only UVB (280-315 nm) and UVA (315-400 nm) radiation in the UV spectrum can pass through the atmosphere and reach ground level. MAAs can absorb lethal doses of these highly energetic UVRs. Early evidence revealed that MAA prevents 3 out of 10 photons from hitting cytoplasmic targets in cyanobacteria [80] . Upon the deleterious effects of UVR, MAAs not only efficiently absorb UVR but also they dissipate excessive energy in form of harmless heat radiation without ROS [20] . Correlation of MAAs and dose of UVR are evident from several reports. In cyanobacteria, the level of MAAs increased when exposed to PAR, UVA, and UVB irradiations [27] [28] [29] [30] [64] [65] [66] [67] . Among these wavelengths, UVB was found to be the most effective inducer of MAA accumulation, either in cyanobacteria and other known MAA producers, such as dinoflagellates [72] . A correlation between MAAs content and irradiance level supports the role of MAAs in photoprotection and as a sunscreen.",

ROS are commonly produced when photosystems absorb more energy than can either be transferred by the electron transport chain to an electron acceptor or dissipated as heat. Various MAAs scavenge ROS such as hydroxyl radicals, hydroperoxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, and superoxide anions [8] . Thus, MAAs can act as an antioxidant under the photooxidative stress condition triggered by ROS. The antioxidant role of MAAs might be of special significance. This property is advantageous in order to scavenge the free radicals generated through oxidative stress either due to UVR or other environmental stresses. Antioxidant activity of various MAAs was examined in vivo and in vitro [33, 34, 76] . In vitro analysis by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) assay revealed that mycosporine-2-glycine and mycosporine-glycine exhibited strong antioxidant properties compared to a lesser extent with shinorine and porphyra-334 [76] . The glycosylated-MAA derivatives found in the desiccant cyanobacterium N. commune also exhibited scavenging activity in vitro [33, 34] . In vivo analysis using the human melanoma cell lines A375 and normal human skin fibroblast (NHSF) revealed that mycosporine-2-glycine protected human cells against oxidative stress-mediated cell death. The presence of mycosporine-2-glycine protected the cells against oxidative stress caused by H 2 O 2 , suggesting that the antioxidant effect of mycosporine-2-glycine could be mediated through cellular mechanisms. Protective mechanism of mycosporine-2-glycine is possibly exerted via NF-kB blocking since mycosporine-2-glycine showed the inhibitory effect on NF-kB signaling [76] . In vitro/in vivo analyses point toward the role of MAAs in the antioxidant system/processes.",

This physiological function serves the cells to keep a balance between intracellular osmotic pressure and outer environment. A very high concentration of MAAs was found in the community of cyanobacteria inhabiting a gypsum crust developing on the bottom of a hypersaline saltern pond in Eilat, Israel in which cyanobacterium A. halophytica was the majority species. The hypoosmotic shock of the medium by freshwater led to the excretion of MAAs out of the cell [79] . In addition, E. coli having A. halophytica MAA synthetic genes for mycosporine-2-glycine synthesis showed salt stress tolerance [82] . Based on these observations, MAA was proposed to serve as the additional osmotic solute in this cyanobacterium.",

These multifunctional biomolecules provide superior function to the sunscreen along with a secondary function through antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiaging properties. Furthermore, MAAs have strong photostability and an absence of cytotoxicity [76, 83] . These outstanding characteristics endorse MAAs as promising candidates in the uses in cosmeceutical, pharmaceutical, biomedical, and biotechnological fields. In terms of the use as a sunscreen, MAAs are superior than the chemical or physical UV-protective compounds. The chemical UV-protective compounds merely provide a physical reflective barrier to the UV; and further, their exciting states generate ROS [84] . On the contrary, MAAs strongly absorb UVR and dissipate excess energy in form of heat without generating ROS. Many chemical UV-protective compounds possess estrogen-like effect in vivo in the range of other known xenoestrogens [85] [86] [87] . Moreover, UV sunscreens based on organic and/or inorganic compounds have shown adverse effects on the environment [87] . Thus, features of MAAs provide a new opportunity in the search for an alternative natural sunscreen compound source. Extreme stability at a wide pH range and temperatures also indicates the potential applications of MAAs [88] . Torres et al. reported that the crude methanolic extract of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos aquae, which contains porphyra-334, showed UVA protection ability comparable to a commercial sun care product of Boots (Boots Soltan Extra Moisturizing SunLotion, batch 1Z) [89] . In fact, products called Helioguard \u00ae 365 and Helionori \u00ae that contains MAAs including porphyra-334 from the red alga Porphyra umbilicalis extract have been successfully commercialized as natural and safe UV-screening compounds [9, 50] . MAAs are also beneficial for applications as skin care products since some MAAs have shown antioxidant and antiskin aging properties (see above). Antioxidant activities of MAAs might be able to contribute to the therapy of oxidation-associated diseases, like inflammation [88] . Several studies have indicated the fact that MAAs possess antiinflammatory activities (see above). In addition, MAAs might serve as candidates for UV blockers for reducing the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) because it has been reported that certain algal-derived sun ray blockers reduced it [5] . Owing to the constantly increasing demand for cosmetics and natural medicines worldwide, MAAs are one of the highly promising and attractive natural products in the field of cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical bioactive compounds discovery.",

With the availability of MAAs from microbial origins particularly the cyanobacteria, there is a feasibility to produce them at industrial scale by taking into account the simplicity of culture medium, high growth rate, and capacity for genetic manipulation. Hence, their production utilizing various biological approaches/technologies may hold a promising future. MAAs and their derivatives meet applications in skin care and cosmetics, biomedical including biotechnological applications. In the last section, we provide a general outline to search recent patents related to MAAs and their applications. By searching the freely accessible databases (such as WIPO, EPO, VSPTO, and Cambia), we retrieved 61 patents. We have tabulated all patents from these databases ( Table 5 .1). These information sources present the state-of-the-art in patents and reflect future technological trends. Novel biotechnological processes for production, extraction, and formulation of MAAs were reported in many patents. MAAs were found to be commonly produced by marine organisms. A list in Table 5 .1 shows that most potential MAA producers were from the red algae, such as Polysiphonia lanosa, Gelidium sesquipedale, Porphyra leucostica, Bangia atropurpurea, and P. umbilicalis [95, 102, 104, 106, 126, 142] . The second group was derived from the microalgae, such as Aphanizomenon and Chlorogloeopsis spp. [101, 117] . The third group was cyanobacteria, Nostoc and Microcystis [110, 124, 125, 129] . MAAs were also produced in the marine lichen Lichina pygmaea [107] and bacteria [93, 122] . A rare case was seen in the starfish or sea anemone [90, 91] .",

For instance, hydrophobic interaction and size exclusive columns [116] , cation and anion exchange chromatography [118] , and a solid-phase extraction column [124] can be found in these patents. The emerging new technologies of a high-resolution separation technique and detection systems possessing very high sensitivity were not mentioned in any patent. Formulation of MAAs can be found either as a sole MAA or together with organic/inorganic sunscreening agents. It seems that formulation with organic or inorganic agents further enhance the protective effect [96] . Formulations were commonly found as o/w emulsion, w/o emulsion with a high UV protection [115] . In some patents, additional natural medicine whitening ingredients [120] , sargassum polysaccharides [123] , and peptide derivatives [131] were used for coformulation. Over the 20-year search window, it was revealed that most patents were discussed based on the utility of MAAs in sunscreen, skin care products, fibroblast growth accelerator, and promoter. The potential use of MAAs as an antioxidant substance was also retrieved. Methods for producing, extracting, formulating, and modifying of MAAs (such as glycosylation) seem to be the most popular in various countries. Additionally, nonmedical application of MAAs was found related to their use in the protection of paint films and plastics from solar degradation.",

Besides being efficient natural sunscreens, some MAAs possess antioxidant functions, contribute to the osmotic balance, and are involved in cell-cell interaction. Thus, MAAs are actually multifunctional metabolites. Potential applications of MAAs have been demonstrated in numerous reports and patents with the superior function in sunscreen together with secondary function through antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiaging properties. With advances in omics and emerging new technologies, extensive research is and will be having a major role in the discovery of natural MAAs for their utilization in cosmeceutical, pharmaceutical, biomedical, and biotechnological fields.",

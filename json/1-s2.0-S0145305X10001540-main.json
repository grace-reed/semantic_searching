    "abstract": "Reef-building corals are representatives of one of the earliest diverging metazoan lineages and are experiencing increases in bleaching events (breakdown of the coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis) and disease outbreaks. The present study investigates the roles of two pattern recognition proteins, the mannose binding lectin Millectin and a complement factor C3-like protein (C3-Am), in the coral Acropora millepora. The results indicate that the innate immune functions of these molecules are conserved and arose early in evolution. C3-Am is expressed in response to injury, and may function as an opsonin. In contrast, Millectin expression is up-regulated in response to lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. These observations, coupled with localization of Millectin in nematocysts in epidermal tissue, and reported binding of pathogens, are consistent with a key role for the lectin in innate immunity. Furthermore, Millectin was consistently detected binding to the symbiont Symbiodinium in vivo, indicating that the Millectin function of recognition and binding of non-self-entities may have been co-opted from an ancient innate immune system into a role in symbiosis.",

The coral holobiont is an obligate association between the coral animal and its dinoflagellate endosymbiont, but this association is delicately balanced and coral reefs worldwide are increasingly threatened by mass coral bleaching events (breakdown of coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis) and outbreaks of poorly understood diseases (Harvell et al., 2002; Hughes et al., 2003; Ward and Lafferty, 2004) . At present, very little is known about both the molecular processes that underpin the establishment and maintenance of the symbiosis, or coral immune responses to pathogens. Consequently, it is fundamental to determine the mechanisms involved in pathogen and symbiont recognition.",

                "text": "Corals have a simple body plan consisting of only two true tissue layers and no organs ( Fig. 1) . Depending on the stage of development (developing or adult coral) these tissues are referred to as the ectoderm/epithelium and the endoderm/gastroderm interlined by the mesoglea. The symbionts Symbiodinium reside mainly in gastrodermal areas located between gut and outer epithelium (barrier to external marine environment) in the oral end of the coral (indicated (a) in Fig. 1 ) and less frequently in gastrodermal areas between gut and skeleton (aboral areas) ( Fig. 1b) . Nematocysts are present in the epithelium in the oral end ( Fig. 1a) , but not in the calicoblastic epithelium (Fig. 1b) . In the coral symbiosis, the eukaryote symbiont (Symbiodinium) is surrounded by a host-derived membrane (symbiosome) and contributes to the host's energy requirements through translocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon (Falkowski et al., 1984; Muscatine et al., 1984; Yellowlees et al., 2008) . The majority of host corals only associate with specific genetic clades or sub-clades of Symbiodinium (e.g. (LaJeunesse, 2005) ), suggesting the presence of a well-developed symbiont recognition system and leading to corals being portrayed as a model organism for symbiotic interactions . Symbiodinium can be either maternally inherited (vertical transmission) or obtained from the environment (horizontal transmission) through phagocytosis by coral tissues (Trench, 1987; Fig. 1 . Schematic representation of adult reef-building coral tissues and structures. Corals have only two true tissue layers, the ectoderm/epithelium and the endoderm/gastroderm interlined by the mesoglea, and no organs. Symbiodinium reside mainly in gastrodermal areas between gut and outer epithelium in the oral end of the coral (a) and less frequently in gastrodermal areas between gut and skeleton (aboral areas) (b) . Nematocysts are present in the epithelium at the oral end (a), but not in the calicoblastic epithelium (b). Schwarz et al., 1999; van Oppen, 2001; Coffroth et al., 2006; Marlow and Martindale, 2007) . Those corals that obtain their symbionts horizontally may phagocytose several Symbiodinium strains along with food particles; however the resulting phagosome then avoids lysosome fusion by unknown means. Appropriate strains then multiply in phagosomes, establishing a stable symbiosis, whilst unsuitable strains are actively removed through cellular processes (Dunn and Weis, 2009) . Symbiodinium is an alveolate (Zhang et al., 2005) , as are many intracellular pathogens, suggesting that analogous mechanisms may underlie the utilization of host immune mechanisms by these eukaryotic pathogens and symbionts for entering the tissues. This hypothesis predicts that mechanisms of self/non-self-recognition have been co-opted into the symbiont establishment process (Weis et al., 2008; Kvennefors et al., 2008) .",

                "text": "Recently it was shown that corals and other cnidarians contain a surprisingly high degree of genetic complexity (Kortschak et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2005; Putnam et al., 2007; , and homologs of many proteins involved in immunity in vertebrates are present in cnidarians, suggesting ancient origins of these molecules in ancestral animals (Miller et al., 2007) . The primary function of the innate immune system is to recognize specific patterns on non-self-entities (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002; Medzhitov and Janeway, 2002) . These patterns are referred to as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002) , or microbe associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), and some of the best studied of these are microbial cell wall components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan and mannan. These and other MAMPs are recognized by proteins referred to as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) or pattern recognition proteins (PRPs) and this class of molecules includes both membrane bound proteins such as the Toll-like receptors and soluble proteins such as lectins. We recently characterised a mannose binding lectin from the coral Acropora millepora that is related to the vertebrate collectins, including mannose binding lectin (MBL) and surfactant protein A (SP-A), as well as to an ancestral ascidian MBL-like protein (Kvennefors et al., 2008) . In vertebrates, SP-A can function as an opsonin for phagocytosis (Madan et al., 1997) and MBL is an important activator of many immune functions, including that of complement via the lectin-complement pathway (Takahashi et al., 2006) . The coral lectin, known as Millectin, was shown to bind both bacteria and Symbiodinium in vitro, suggesting roles for the protein in both immunity and symbiont recruitment (Kvennefors et al., 2008) . The detection of a high degree of sequence variation in the binding region of Millectin implies diversity in the binding repertoire (Kvennefors et al., 2008) , perhaps to accommodate diverse target MAMPs.",

The discovery of a vertebrate C3 homolog in the gorgonian coral Swiftia exserta (Dishaw et al., 2005) and similar molecules in other invertebrates (Raftos et al., 2002; Clow et al., 2004; Endo et al., 2006; Castillo et al., 2009) that predate the origins of the adaptive immune system suggests not only ancient origins for this molecule, but also for a prototype complement pathway. The C3 proteins belong to the thiolester-containing protein (TEP) family, which also includes opsonins from insects (Levashina et al., 2001) , and sea urchin and horseshoe crab C3 with opsonic capabilities (Smith, 2002; Clow et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2005; Ariki et al., 2008) . In addition, the C3like proteins from ascidians have been implicated in inflammatory responses (Raftos et al., 2003; Raftos et al., 2004) . Interestingly, a 'primitive' form of the complement system, in which lectins interact with C3 for direct activation of phagocytosis, has been reported in invertebrates (Zhu et al., 2005; Endo et al., 2006) . In ascidians, this opsonisation and activation includes the MBL-like protein (referred to as GBL; (Sekine et al., 2001 )) related to Millectin. Therefore, further investigations to determine the roles in coral immunity of both Millectin and a recently discovered C3-like molecule from A. millepora (C3-Am) (Miller et al., 2007) are warranted.",

A small piece of the coral fragment (2 cm 3 ), or equivalent amount of control samples, was crushed in liquid nitrogen and transferred to a 1 ml aliquot of TRIzol reagent. The coral was further disrupted in TRIzol using a handheld homogenizer on maximum speed for 30 s. Total RNA from the remaining slurry was extracted using the manufacturer's protocol, which includes an initial centrifugation step that effectively removes coral skeleton particles. The quality of mRNA was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyser and RNA Nano Labchip (Agilent Technologies). The quantity of total extracted RNA was determined using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop ND-1000) at 260 nm. An aliquot of 300 ng of RNA from each prepared sample was converted to cDNA using a Quantitect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. This kit includes an initial DNAse treatment to remove any contaminating DNA and a final RNAse treatment to remove any residual RNA after conversion. Controls for DNA contamination included mRNA from samples used that were subjected to treatments as according to the Quantitect Reverse Transcription Kit, but with no added reverse transcriptase. For internal reference during quantitative real-time PCR, partial sequences of 2 genes constitutively expressed under experimental conditions, and previously used in gene expression analysis were provided by Dr F. Seneca. These were an unknown EST named Contig1913 (Csaszar et al., 2009) and adenosyl-homocysteinase (AdoHcyase) (Levy et al., 2007) . \u2424-Actin was also included as a reference gene as it has previously been used in gene expression studies of A. millepora (Levy et al., 2007) , and has been shown to be stable and unaffected by varying symbiont contributions in other cnidarians (Rodriguez-Lanetty et al., 2008) . Primers for use in quantitative real-time PCR were designed using Primer Express TM v. 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) (Table 1) . Test PCR amplifications confirmed the calculated amplicon sizes (70-100 bp) and subsequent melting temperature curves of each amplicon were established. Efficiency of target amplification was optimized by evaluation of four primer concentrations (200, 150, 100 and 50 nM) and series of 2-, 5-and 10-fold dilutions of template cDNA from control and experimental coral samples. Constant cycle threshold (C t ) values were observed at a 200 nM primer concentrations for each of the primer pairs and cDNA dilutions above 10-fold dilutions were shown to produce non-inhibited PCR reactions. Triplicate first strand cDNA aliquots (2 l) from a 20-fold dilution of each sample served as templates for quantitative PCR in 10 l reactions using SYBR \u00ae GREEN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 200 nM of each specific primer in a ABI 7900HT thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR conditions were as follows; initial denaturation (95 \u2022 C, 10 min), 45 cycles of a denaturation step (95 \u2022 C, 15 s) and hybridisation-elongation step (60 \u2022 C, 1 min), where a subsequent melting temperature curve of the amplicon was also performed. Target genes were normalized against expression of internal control genes (reference) in the corresponding sample using the formula: 2 \u2212(C t target\u2212C t reference) , with the cycle threshold (C t ) set at 0.12 for all genes.",

Comparison of the A. millepora protein with the C3 sequences from soft coral, horseshoe crab and man implied that the basic domain structure is highly conserved (Fig. 2) . As in the case of other cnidarian C3-like proteins (Dishaw et al., 2005; Kimura et al., 2009) , sites required for activation and function of the protein were conserved in the A. millepora protein, including the cleavage site for release of the alpha and beta chains, the C3a anaphylatoxin region, catalytic histidine residue and thioester site (Fig. 2) . A predicted signal peptide for secretion, in common with other C3 proteins, was also observed (Fig. 2) .",

Differential gene expression was measured following injection of control phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or one of two defined immunogens: peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cell wall components of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, respectively. Control injections of PBS had a significant effect on C3-Am expression (baseline vs. PBS 720 min, P < 0.05) and the effect was time dependent (Fig. 4a) , indicating that the physical process of injection and injury induced C3 expression. This high background in injection controls, and high levels of variation between replicates meant that no significant effects could be detected in C3 expression following treatment with immunogens ( Fig. 4a) .",

Areas that showed epithelial staining were often accompanied by staining in the mesoglea (for tissue structures see Figs. 1 and 6a ) ( Fig. 6g  and h ), perhaps indicating a targeted C3 release response in specific areas of the epithelia. Probing sections with the anti-Millectin antibody revealed intense staining associated with nematocysts in the coral epithelium ( Fig. 6b and d) . Immunostaining for Millectin was also observed coating Symbiodinium cells residing in the gastroderm, and some compartments in the gastroderm lining of the gut and skeleton also stained intensely (Fig. 6b and  c) . No staining was observed in pre-immune serum controls for either of the primary antibodies ( Fig. 6e and f) or when primary antibody was omitted (data not shown).

In higher animals, many immune-related genes are induced in response to MAMPs, via signaling cascades, following recognition by Toll-like receptors and other PRPs. In A. millepora, both LPS and peptidoglycan upregulated the putative PRP, the C-type lectin Millectin (Kvennefors et al., 2008) , suggesting a function in response to microbial challenge. However, the kinetics of the Millectin induction differed between MAMPs. The response to LPS was short and fast, while the response to peptidoglycan was slower, suggesting that activation may occur by two distinct pathways. In other animals, secreted PRP lectins, similar to Millectin, function as acute phase proteins that are immediately induced in response to infection or invasion. The rapid response to LPS treatment is consistent with an acute phase protein role for Millectin in the coral.",

While it cannot be completely excluded that bacteria from the mucus may have entered the tissues during the injection process resulting in the observed response for C3-Am, the lack of response to the same control procedure by Millectin (that clearly responds to both LPS and peptidoglycan) indicates that this is not the case. In addition, no change of expression in response to injection of the buffer was recorded in additional immune molecules investigated (unpublished data). Hence, we suggest that C3-Am expression may be regulated in response to physical trauma, perhaps providing a first line of defense in mediating inflammatory processes following tissue damage (Raftos et al., 2003; Raftos et al., 2004) . A similar role has been proposed in humans, where C3 and the proteins required for its activation are present in the epidermis and keratinocytes (Dovezenski et al., 1992) . Moreover, complement factors may function in wound healing and tissue regeneration in the newt Notophthalmus viridescens, as C3 and C5 are expressed during limb and lens regeneration, but not in undamaged tissue (Kimura et al., 2003) . Although the role of C3 in the wound repair process remains to be elucidated, numerous studies have reported C3 activation following injury to various tissues including the epidermis, muscle and the nervous system (Dovezenski et al., 1992; Bellander et al., 2001; Kimura et al., 2003; Ohlsson et al., 2003; Ganter et al., 2007) . The mechanism of C3 activation in response to tissue trauma in coral therefore requires further investigation.",

In lab acclimated corals, un-induced Millectin expression levels were very low, whereas in field samples the gene was expressed at a similar (moderately high) level to the constitutively expressed gene \u2424-actin, suggesting a housekeeping role for this protein in the coral. The down-regulation of Millectin in this particular case proved useful as we were able to more effectively demonstrate the response to MAMPs by reducing the background level against which responses to immune challenges are observed. However, differing studies, especially those involving disease transmission should take such changes into account when extrapolating results from studies carried out in aquaria to the field situation. There are several possible explanations for the decreased expression of Millectin observed in aquarium-acclimated coral including (but not limited to): reduced levels of disturbances such as grazing (from microorganisms in grazers mouths); or redirection of energy away , (e and f) Controls in which pre-immune serum was substituted for either anti-Millectin (e) or anti-C3-Am (f), showed no staining.

One outstanding fundamental question in coral biology is how the symbionts become established and are able to persist in host tissue. Two different routes of uptake have been suggested: symbionts may either directly enter endodermal cells via the oral pore in early development (Schwarz et al., 1999) , or initially enter via the ectoderm and subsequently be shunted into the endoderm/gastroderm (Marlow and Martindale, 2007) . As Symbiodinium are related to intracellular pathogens that utilize host immune mechanisms to enter the tissues, and both pathogens and symbionts would be recognized by non-self-recognition molecules (i.e. PRPs), it is likely that some of the molecules within the broad repertoire of putative cnidarian PRRs or PRPs (Miller et al., 2007; Schwarz et al., 2008) are not only involved in immunity, but perhaps also, or even exclusively, involved in host/symbiont interactions.",

Consistent with the early expression observed in the endoderm, the C3-Am was detected in parts of the adult coral gastroderm (endoderm). While the pattern of staining suggested that C3 was most abundant in parts of the gastroderm closely associated with Symbiodinium, some coral C3 appears to also be associated with the mesoglea and areas of ectoderm/epithelium. In vertebrates, C3 circulates in the plasma or blood, but the localization of C3 in invertebrates is different. For example, in a pattern reminiscent of that seen in the coral, aggregates of C3 protein have been observed in the epithelia of the bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes (Castillo et al., 2009) . The localization of C3-Am in the epithelia that represents the barrier towards the external marine environment, along with the observed up-regulation in response to injury, supports the hypothesis of a role for this protein in coral immunity in response to invasion associated with tissue traumas. Several other invertebrate C3 proteins have the functional characteristics of opsonins (Smith, 2002; Clow et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2005; Ariki et al., 2008) and, given the high sequence similarity and conserved structure of activation sites of the coral protein with these, it is likely that coral C3 can also function as an opsonin. As C3-Am staining was consistently observed in areas of the gastroderm closely associated with Symbiodinium, it may be that C3 participates in opsonisation of the symbionts to be phagocytosed and incorporated into the coral cell. However, the staining patterns observed for C3 are less clear than those observed for Millectin. Nonetheless, these results provide a framework for future research into the functional roles of coral C3 in opsonisation and symbiont interaction.",

                "text": "Immunohistochemistry using specific anti-Millectin antibody to probe sections of coral sampled from the reef resulted in dense staining of nematocysts (capsules with an inverted tubule and associated operculum for prey capture or colony defense (Mariscal, 1974; Westfall, 1966) ) in the epithelia and around Symbiodinium. Dense rounded aggregates (putative vesicles) lining the gastroderm directly adjacent to the lining of the gut in both oral (facing the mouth and external environment) and aboral (lining the skeleton) tissue were also observed. The dense immunostaining is consistent with the high levels of Millectin gene expression in reef samples detected by quantitative PCR in the current study. Localization of the protein to both the nematocysts and the gastroderm would ensure that pathogens are exposed to Millectin regardless of how they enter the coral. Given the agglutination capabilities of bacteria by Millectin, such exposure would ensure an effective means of inhibiting further colonization of the tissues (Kvennefors et al., 2008) . Millectin has previously been shown to contain a signal peptide for secretion. This signal peptide, and an additional 30 amino acids of the N-terminal sequence, appears to be cleaved in activated proteins (protein with carbohydrate-binding capabilities) (Kvennefors et al., 2008) . The sizes detected on Western blots in the present study, indicate that a large proportion of the Millectin in coral tissue retains the signal sequence and is uncleaved occurring as the full length inactive protein. Unconventional secretion of proteins, bypassing the Golgi and thus leaving signal peptides intact, may be more common than previously thought (Nickel and Rabouille, 2009) , therefore it is possible that Millectin is secreted in an uncleaved state and, subsequent to release the lectin may be cleaved for activation, hence avoiding damage of host tissues by the activated protein. The immunohistochemistry data indicates that Millectin is secreted into the vacuole of the nematocysts and packaged into transport vesicles that may fuse with the plasma membrane of the gastroderm for the contents to be secreted in response to invasion. It is hypothesized that the protein resides in these vesicles in un-activated (uncleaved) form, until stimulated nematocysts discharge explosively and release their contents (Holstein and Tardent, 1984) , or the gastroderm vacuoles fuse with a potential invader/symbiont through the plasma membrane. This hypothesis is consistent with previous reports that mechanical stimuli induce immediate release of antimicrobial proteins from corals (Geffen and Rosenberg, 2005) and that glycoproteins with cytotoxic activity are present in cnidarian nematocysts (Bernheimer and Avigad, 1976; Helmholz et al., 2008) . Although the identities of these proteins are unknown, the nematocyst proteins were isolated using lectin-affinity methods and are similar in molecular mass to Millectin (Helmholz et al., 2008) . Localization of Millectin in the lining of the gastroderm may provide a first line of defense against pathogens such as endolithic algae that attempt to penetrate the tissues lining the skeleton, where no nematocysts are present (Yarden et al., 2007) .",

Recently, a lectin (PdC-Lectin) from the coral Pocillopora damicornis was also observed to coat Symbiodinium in vivo (Vidal-Dupiol et al., 2009) and it is likely that several proteins (perhaps several lectins) are involved in the symbiosis process. An analogous situation to that of the staining pattern in the present study is seen in the soft coral Sinularia lochmodes, where the galactose-binding lectin SLL2 is abundant in nematocysts and binds to a dinoflagellate symbiont (Jimbo et al., 2000; Jimbo et al., 2005) . Intriguingly, the SLL2 protein induced transformation of the free-living dinoflagellate to a stage appropriate for symbiosis (Koike et al., 2004) , suggesting that Millectin could have a similar function in Acropora spp. Lectins are critical for phagocytosis of Symbiodinium by the coral (Wood-Charlson et al., 2006) and the phylogenetic position, structure and observed pattern recognition capabilities of Millectin make it probable that this protein act as an opsonin during phagocytosis of symbionts. While the precise mechanisms of these interactions require investigation, the results presented here specifically implicate Millectin not only in coral immune responses, but also in host/symbiont interactions.",

The coral C3 protein is expressed in response to trauma and injury, and similarity at the level of sequence homology and predicted structure implies a potential function as an opsonin that could be relevant to both immunity and symbiosis. However, the role of the C3 protein in response to invaders and symbionts is, as yet, unclear. The mannose binding lectin Millectin not only binds to symbionts in vitro, but immunocytochemistry implies a similar association in vivo. In addition to an apparent role in symbiosis, Millectin expression is up-regulated in response to immunogens which, along with observed immunostaining patterns and previous observations of agglutination capabilities, suggests a further role in immunity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the pattern recognition properties of Millectin have been coopted from an ancient innate immune system to a role in symbiosis; as symbiosis and parasitism are often regarded as two extremes of the same phenomenon, the involvement of some proteins in both is perhaps to be expected.",

A band with MR \u223c 80 kDa is indicated that corresponds to the expected size of the monomeric C3 \u2424 chain. Lane 3: coral protein extracts separated under reducing conditions probed with corresponding pre-immune serum (negative control). Lane 4: cultured Symbiodinium under reducing conditions probed with the anti-C3 antibody (control for non-specific Symbiodinium cross-reaction). Neither lanes containing controls displayed any cross-reacting immunostaining in either (a) or (b). Blots were visualized utilizing alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed with 1 Step TM NBT/BCIP."

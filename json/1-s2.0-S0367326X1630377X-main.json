                "text": "The sun is life for living beings and earth; oxygen, water and food cycles are connected with UV radiation. Regarding human health, most of the positive effects of solar radiations are mediated by UVB production of vitamin D in skin. However, several other effects may be considered: tanning (increases melanin in skin as sunscreen) and improvement of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis and localized scleroderma by heliotherapy or phototherapy (artificial UV radiation). Furthermore, reductions of blood pressure and antimicrobial effects have been attributed to UV-induced nitric oxide (NO) production, which can also act as a neurotransmitter. Finally, UV exposure may improve mood through the release of endorphins. All these effects have been extensively reviewed in recent works. Keratinocytes produce opioid Beta-endorphin following UV exposure and this effect may be implicated in tanning 'addiction'. Sun exposure is associated with improved mood and increased energy levels. Melatonin and serotonin regulation is influenced by sunlight, and improvement in cognition is observed with increased sun exposure particularly in depressed individuals [1, 2] .",

Chronic exposure of human skin to solar UV radiation is widely recognised as the key factor responsible for photoaging. For these reasons the role of photoprotection is critical to avoid skin cancer and others undesired effects [4] .",

This should be a \"UVA-PF\" of at least 1/3 of the SPF (certified by a specific UVA circled label).

The ROS presence determines the membrane cell lipo-peroxidation and enhances skin aging and tissue damage. Antioxidants from herbal sources may provide new possibilities for the treatment and prevention of UVmediated damages. Phenolic, polyphenolic compounds and flavonoids represent an important source of natural antioxidant extracts.

Green Tea Polyphenols (GTP) showed chemoprotective effects in mice and mouse test and seems to be able to prevent cutaneous edema, erythema and lipid peroxidation. Moreover, it might increase antioxidant defence of skin enzyme system. C. sinensis extracts may also prevent oxidative DNA single strand damage caused by UV exposure and they may reduce CPDs formation in human dermis and epidermis. Active ingredients from C. sinensis may prevent UV photo-damage due to synergic effects, which involve apoptosis in human epidermal carcinoma, reduction of lipid peroxidation, erythema and ROS production. Other authors [42, 43, 49, 50] studied the photo-protective properties of C. sinensis compounds and showed the preventive effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) against UV-radiation-induced infiltration of activated leukocytes in mouse skin, responsible of UV-induced suppression of immune responses and oxidative stress. Furthermore, in vivo studies on GTP and specifically on EGCG evidenced attenuation of UVB-induced oxidative stress and decrease of the oxidative stress-mediated by MAPK proteins, responsible of cutaneous carcinogenesis risk. GTP can act also as antioxidant showing beneficial effects in protecting human skin disorders and photo-aging. Authors demonstrated, in human skin studies, that topical application of EGCG can inhibit the erythema and H 2 O 2 production after UVB exposition. Moreover, it has been reported the suppression of leukocyte infiltration, a characteristic feature of skin inflammation, and the suppression of UVB-induced enhanced generation of PG metabolite. It is worth to mention that EGCG does not absorb or block UVB radiation and that it is not considered a sunscreen compound. Thus the photo-protective properties are related to the antioxidant activity. Huang and coworkers [51] described the ECG in vitro photo-protective effects against UVB-induced damage, focusing on the inhibition of intracellular H 2 O 2 generation, lipid peroxidation and MAPKs activation, in compliance with a strong antioxidant activity.",

Proliferation of L929 mouse fibroblasts was not interfered by small concentrations of extract (15 mg/mL), that became toxic only at higher concentrations (35 mg/mL). In addition, inhibition of cellular proliferation of human breast cancer cells T47D was observed at all dosage. Despite these controversial results about a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, the oral treatment with 150 and 300 mg/kg of the hydroalcoholic extract showed a protective effect against UVB irradiation-induced GSH (endogenous reduced glutathione) depletion. This test is considered as a sensitive probe of UVB-induced epidermal oxidative stress and it indicates in C. officinalis extract a promising product also due to the in vitro antioxidant results. The authors reported a higher activity in scavenging superoxide radicals produced in the xanthine/ luminol/XOD system, as compared to quercetin, but a lower activity against the hydroxyl, peroxyl and alkoxyl radicals produced during lipid peroxidation and by the DPPH radical. The results of the topical application of the hydroalcholic extract in three different formulations were especially interesting: if compared with two emulsions containing two self-emulsifying additives, the gel was the most effective for the delivery of the extract in the viable epidermis. It was reported that gel formulation maintained GSH reduced levels close to those of nonirradiated animals. In addition, the application of the gel formulation in hairless mice reduced the histological skin damages induced by UVB irradiation. Rutin and narcissin were identified as the main components of the extract, probably responsible of the observed effects.",

The study considered to completely replace the aqueous external phase of the oil in water (O/W) sunscreen emulsion by the mentioned C. sinensis extracts. All the formulations tested contained avobenzone and octyl methoxycinnamate as synthetic UV filter. Stability upon storage and in vitro photoprotection assays showed that both extracts were able to improve the photostabilizing ability of the formulations, if compared with a pure water external phase. As reported in these study and several other researches, these findings allow to consider C. sinensis extracts as potential synergic agents for safer and more efficient sunscreen formulations [ The photoprotective effects of cosmetics based on Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa (strawberry) extract were performed on dermal fibroblast [56] . Due to the presence of anthocyanin (pelargonidin glycoside and cyanidin glycosides) and vitamin (vitamin C and \u03b2-carotene), F. Ananassa showed a strong antioxidant activity. The photoprotective activity of several formulations containing F. ananassa extract and coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ) was measured on human dermal fibroblast irradiated with UVA. Later the decrease of cell death was determined by MTT assay. All the formulations showed a significant increase of the cell viability. Particularly, the emulsion containing F. ananassa extract and 100 \u03bcg/mL of CoQ , even in absence of an SPF, may provide a result closer to non-irradiated samples, showing a strong recovering effect of cell viability. One more time, a formulation strategy that imply a synergic effect of chemical UV filters, natural extract and active ingredients seems to be an interesting choice for photoprotection.",

Rutin and P. incarnata L. dry extract have been increased UVA filtering effects as compared with control. Additionally, the work has confirmed the relevance of the sunscreen vehicle.

After UV-B irradiation, for both extracts concentration, an increased MnSOD and GPx activity and the reduction of the formation of sunburn cells in skin was reported. The second one was performed by in vivo test on SKH-1 mice skin. The topical application of V. vinifera grape seeds extract inhibited UVB-induced sunburn cells and CPDs formation twenty hours after the UV irradiation.

The studied antocyanins were able to protect skin against UVB-induced photoaging due to the capability to stop collagen degradation and inflammatory responses. It seems that V. uliginosum L. extracts can block transcriptional mechanism of NF-kB and MAPK. 13 Figueiredo and co-workers [81] investigated the in vitro and in vivo photo-protective and photochemopreventive potential of Garcinia brasiliensis epicarp extract. A high level of polyphenols was found. Studies identified 7-Epiclusianone, a polyisoprenylated benzophenone, as major component. The study reports that 7-Epiclusianone showed a capacity to absorb UVB radiation five times smaller than benzophenone-3. In the respect of this latter, despite its lover UVB absorption activity, 7-Epiclusianone presents less penetration into the skin, and thus only a slight irritating effect. Moreover, in vitro studies on fibroblasts cell culture, showed that solutions and cream gel formulations containing G. brasiliensis extract (10% and 20% respectively) had photoprotective properties comparable with commercial sunscreen from two different brands with three different sun protection factors (15, 30 and 60) . About in vivo photoprotective properties, on 3-month-old, sex-matched hairless mice, GSH depletion induced by UVB radiation was completely inhibited by G. brasiliensis formulation, probably due to the prevention of the generation of ROS and/or scavenging of radical reactive species. Irradiated mice skin was treated with G. brasiliensis formulation and showed similar myeloperoxidase activity if compared with non-irradiated skin, suggesting a preventing activity on the inflammatory process induced by radiation. Thus, UVB radiation absorption activity and the concomitant antioxidant properties, prevent oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Indeed, the extract efficiency prevents any increase in MPO activity, the inhibition of neutrophil migration toward the exposed area, and also the inhibition of the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (as TNF-a and IL-1b) induced by UVB radiation, indicating activity on first and second phase of the UVB driven inflammatory process. Authors concluded that the extract has a great potential to be used as a sunscreen, in addition to synthetic UV filters, contributing to the reduction of synthetic filters in the formulations. Furthermore, the extract comes from the peel of the fruit that is a by-product of G. brasiliensis, which represents a sustainable application.",

P. multiform thumb seems to be able to reduce the UVB-induced oxidative stress avoiding the photo aging effects. In the same review the authors discussed the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of the Polypodium leucotomos hydrophilic extract, which can inhibit the erythema generated from in vivo UVB light and PUVA therapy. This effect can be probably explained by the extract capability to inhibit pro inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 or interleukin-6. Furthermore, P. leucotomos extract preserves Langerhans cells characteristics (morphology and number) when irradiated by UV light and PUVA therapy. At the same time, attention has been drawn to the reduction of chronic UVB-induced elastosis and probable prevention of photo induced skin tumor, due to the capability of hydrophilic extract to inhibit UVB light and PUVA therapy induced erythema and the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines. The same authors described also the photo protective activity of Punica granatum. Probably due to the presence of hydrolizable tannins and anthocyanidins, the specie possesses known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. P. granatum can inhibit UVB-dependent activation of NF-\u0137B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, protecting the skin against UVB radiation damage.",

The benchmark commercial product, Nivea sun Spray, achieved an average of 4.2 with a label SPF of 5. The in vitro test membrane protection factor (MPF) is principally an index of membrane destruction. Values obtained from the 4 natural molecules were compared with octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC), a very common synthetic filter, as reference. Again usnic acid resulted as the best UVB filter, with an average of 4,5. The other lichen extracts gave similar values. Moreover, molecules tested in this study showed a different absorption after prolonged UV irradiation, indicating the presence of by-products.

Six polyaromatic compounds, respectively Calycine,1\u2032-chloropannarine, usnic acid, epiphorelic acid I and II and vicanicine, were extracted from lichens and investigated in order to determine their value as sunscreen additives. The radical cations of usnic acid and calycine showed efficient scavenging activity, suggesting a possible synergic use as antioxidants additives in combination with vitamins E and C. Finally, the authors concluded that considering their previous study, calycine certainly deserves further investigation for photo protection activities.",

For these reason, molecules obtained from U. roccellina may be compared with commercial synthetic UVB filter and can be suggested as UVB photo-protective agents. Moreover, decarboxythamnolic acid was found to be a strong antioxidant agent by in vitro assays (DPPH test and Ferric reducing power test).

Probably the most innovative concern photolyase enzyme, first isolated from the cyanobacteria, Anacystis nidulans. Many different photoprotective activities have been related to photolyase enzyme: for example, recognition and removal of cell DNA fragments damaged by UV radiation; degradation of pyrimidine dimer caused by UV radiation; inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin 6, responsible of skin inflammation; inhibition of UV-induced apoptosis. The inclusion of photolyase enzyme in multi-layer phospholipid envelope allows its penetration into the skin up to deeper layers, showing again the relevance of the synergic effect of active molecules and pharmaceutical or cosmetic formulation. The same authors mentioned also another enzyme able to repair UV-induced damaged cells, the cells endonuclease (obtained from Micrococcus luteus). The enzyme, also applied into multi-layer phospholipid envelope, improves efficiency and speed of DNA repair mechanism, improves skin regeneration and inhibits inflammatory response. Regarding \u03b2-carotene and lycopene, the skin burn prevention activity seems to be due to their ability to scavenge ROS. The same authors, mentioned also EGCG, ferulic acid, Pycnogenol\u00ae and Polypodium leucotomos extracts for their antioxidant and photoprotective activities.",

To demonstrate or to predict a UVB photoprotective effects, on the base of the UV absorption activity, must be considered a prerequisite. This is normally addressed with a preliminary in vitro study, useful to address further research on a species or an extract, but not adequate to warrant an in vivo UV-damage protection. Chemical stability and photostability of the extract in a sunscreen formulation, its absorption through stratum corneum layer and others synergic effects with the excipients, should be a second step of investigation. Finally, step 3, is very important to assess the \"real\" sunscreen properties and should be always part of any discovery strategy. But, on the contrary, it often lacks from the literature so far examined and we believe that in the future studies should be aimed to the reinvestigation of the extracts not completely exploited and in performing complete studies in any newly investigated extract. Taking into account that the trend for the future points to the development of \"green\" and/or \"certified eco-bio\" sunscreens, it is very important to adopt, since now, the above stated strategies in any study aimed to investigate sunscreen properties of UV absorbing natural molecules.",

Governments can play a strategic role by supporting the development of standardized methodologies and stimulating, by significant extent, collaboration in this sense between company and academy. Are there practical solutions to be adopted right now? One short-term policy should be to encourage people to use medium and high protection instead of very high. If correctly applied a medium protection (SPF 30) filter 97% of the UV-B radiation rather than 98% of an high protection (SPF 50) with significantly less filters to be used to gain only 1% more protection. On the long term the use of sunscreen filters of natural origin would be much more appealing. However, in this regards there are very scarce information yet in the scientific literature.",

In our opinion, nowadays, the rational evolution of sunscreen formulations has to involve proven UVB absorption capability, antioxidant effects, other synergic protective mechanisms and, finally, good toxicological profiles. Several natural molecules can provide these biological activities, including also synergic effect or enhancers of photo stability. A large number of herbal extracts and plant origin molecules showed UV absorption, antinflammatory, anti-photoage and antioxidant activities, demonstrated by several in vivo and in vitro studies. They also demonstrate the protection against DNA and other cellular structures damages, often accompanied with low toxicity or even cell viability enhance activity, in the respects of synthetic filters.",

A large body of studies reports only UV absorption activity (step 1), a necessary but not sufficient condition to support a proven sun care activity. The same concept can be expressed for the in vitro bioactivity studies (step 2), which represent the object of several researches; but that cannot warrant effects in the final formulations. Studies should now focus on step 3 in order to understand the whole role of herbal extract in exerting their photoprotective activity. With these premises, and taking into account best formulation practices about sunscreen products, the optimal UV absorption feature should be identified with a wide range UVA and UVB photoprotection. Natural UV filters, should be then able to absorb solar radiations between 290 and 400 nm. To fulfill these criteria, the studies about N. sativa [34] , P. glabra [36] and B. cordata extracts, as well as for secalonic acid B [83] obtained from lichens, shows the most promising preliminary result.",

On the other hand, the finished solar products (sunscreen) that contain herbal derivatives are, instead, well represented on the market, and used as ancillary or ingredients with different claims. SPF factor and photo-protection activity, within these products, are mainly based on accepted synthetic or mineral UV filters. As stated above, this occurrence is mainly related to the scarce attention given to their formulation strategies, considering that, at least in vitro, herbal extracts can work as filters as efficiently as the synthetic ones. As for the case of natural preservatives, we believe that this field of investigation holds much promise in the development of natural and safe solar products that are currently most wanted by consumers. Moreover, in this review we have reported interesting data about the influence of different cosmetic excipients and different formulations on photo-protective effects [31, 60, 61, 62] . Finally, researches should consider as a primary approach new formulation strategies, based on bioactive natural UV filter which are successfully tested in vivo.",

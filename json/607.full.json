The algae, in turn, rely on the host for the supply of inorganic carbon. Carbon must be concentrated as CO 2 in order for photosynthesis to proceed, and here we show that the coral host plays an active role in this process. The host-derived symbiosome membrane surrounding the algae abundantly expresses vacuolar H + -ATPase (VHA), which acidifies the symbiosome space down to pH \u223c4. Inhibition of VHA results in a significant decrease in average H + activity in the symbiosome of up to 75% and a significant reduction in O 2 production rate, a measure of photosynthetic activity. These results suggest that host VHA is part of a previously unidentified carbon concentrating mechanism for algal photosynthesis and provide mechanistic evidence that coral host cells can actively modulate the physiology of their symbionts.",

Coral growth and calcification is supported by the translocation of fixed organic carbon from endosymbiotic dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium, commonly referred to as zooxanthellae (2) . The evolution of this partnership has allowed corals to thrive in oligotrophic tropical marine environments where food and nutrients are generally scarce (2) , leading to the rise of coral reefs around 250 million years ago (3) . In addition to providing corals with a source of metabolic energy, symbiont photosynthesis is hypothesized to promote coral calcification by supplying precursors for the skeletal organic matrix and by buffering the protons produced during precipitation of the coral's calcium carbonate skeleton (4, 5) . Not surprisingly, breakdown of this symbiosis, known as coral bleaching, has serious negative effects on coral physiology and consequently the health of coral reef ecosystems (6, 7) . However, despite the clear significance of coral-algae symbiosis in the health of coral reef ecosystems, much remains to be learned about the fundamental cellular mechanisms involved. Understanding these central aspects of coral biology is critical for predicting coral responses to ongoing environmental changes and for developing successful management strategies.",

Symbiodinium are acquired by coral gastrodermal cells via phagocytosis leading to the formation of an intracellular membrane-enclosed compartment known as the \"symbiosome\" (8) . The outer host-derived membrane of the symbiosome goes through a maturation process following alga phagocytosis, whereas the algae develops a membrane complex through which it interacts with the host (2) . Due to their intracellular location, Symbiodinium rely on the coral host to supply dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and nutrients for growth and photosynthesis, all of which must be transported across multiple host membranes to reach the algae.

Due to the pH-dependent nature of the chemical equilibria between CO 2 , HCO 3 \u2212 , and CO 2-, the predominant form of DIC present in the coral cytoplasm (pH > 7) (11) is HCO \u2212 . This suggests that bicarbonate channels and/or transporters are required to supply Symbiodinium with the DIC needed for photosynthesis (12) . Furthermore, the low affinity of dinoflagellate Rubisco for CO 2 requires that this DIC supply be concentrated via a carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) in order for photosynthesis to occur (13) . Symbiodinium have been shown to use carbonic anhydrases (CAs) as part of a CCM during symbiosis (14) . The role of the host coral in an algal CCM is as yet unknown, although coral CAs may also be involved. Intriguingly, studies have suggested that the symbiosome compartment is acidic (11, 15) . If the pH of the symbiosome lumen was below pH 6.1, the pK a for the conversion of CO and HCO 3 \u2212 and the formation of CO 2 would be favored. As CO can diffuse across the algal plasma membrane, this would promote accumulation of CO 2 in the algal cell. However, the pH value of the symbiosome lumen and the mechanisms that generate this proton gradient remain largely unknown.",

Acidification of the algal microenvironment by VHA promotes photosynthesis, demonstrating that the coral host can actively regulate symbiont physiology.

Although transcriptomic data indicate that VHA is expressed in corals (18) , no information is available on its cellular localization or physiological roles. Here we explored the hypothesis that coral VHA is involved in the acidification of the symbiosome lumen and found that (i) VHA is expressed in the host-derived symbiosome membrane of two distantly related coral species representing the two main clades of Scleractinia (Robusta and Complexa); (ii) symbiosome pH is highly acidic (pH \u223c4), and this acidification is partially dependent on VHA activity; and (iii) VHA activity is essential for optimal photosynthetic rate of colonies of both coral species. These results indicate that VHA-dependent symbiosome acidification acts as a CCM that promotes symbiont photosynthesis and implies that the coral host has control over the photosynthetic activity of its algal symbiont. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms of coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis, which will facilitate future work on the effects of environmental stress on the physiology of reefbuilding corals.",

Coral VHA was highly conserved with human VHA, including 100% conservation of the anti-VHA B antibody epitope (Fig. S1E) . The anti-VHA B antibody epitope was also highly conserved in Symbiodinium sp., with only one amino acid difference ( Fig. S1E) . Expression of the VHA protein was confirmed in both coral species by Western blot with the anti-VHA B antibody, which recognized a \u223c55-kDa protein in A. yongei ( Fig.  S1B ) and S. pistillata (Fig. S1C ). VHA protein was also detected in cultured Symbiodinium (Fig. S1D) ; however, detection required loading of 11-fold more protein, indicating that VHA is expressed at a much lower level in the Symbiodinium than in the host coral.",

Because the plasma membrane of the coral host cell, its cytoplasm, the symbiosome membrane, and the Symbiodinium cell wall and plasma membrane are extremely close together (\u223c100 nm; Fig. S2 ), immunolocalization of VHA in isolated cells was required to determine its specific intracellular localization. In isolated coral cells containing one or two algal cells and a host nucleus, VHA staining was consistently observed surrounding the perimeter of the algal cells, but not in the host plasma membrane external to the host nucleus (88/102 cells, or 86%; Fig. 2 C-F) . In contrast, a minority of free algal cells, as evidenced by the lack of a host nucleus, showed VHA staining (21/186 cells, or 11%; Fig. 2 G and H), likely in symbiosome membrane remnants. This indicates that VHA is only present surrounding the algal cells when the symbiosis is intact and is therefore most likely found in the host-derived symbiosome membrane. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to directly localize a proton pump in cnidarians, and the presence of VHA in the host-derived symbiosome membrane suggests that it is involved in transporting protons into the symbiosome lumen, and may therefore be involved in regulating physiological processes related to symbiosis. In addition, these results contrast with previous predictions that coral proton pumps are predominantly found in the plasma membrane of various coral cell types (5, 18, 21, 22) , with obvious implications about VHA physiological functions.",

Because VHA is typically involved in acidifying diverse intracellular compartments such as lysosomes, endosomes, synaptic vesicles, and vacuoles, we sought to determine if it similarly acidifies the coral symbiosome compartment. In addition, the pH of the symbiosome lumen in Cnidarians has not been established, and this parameter likely plays an important role in regulating the trafficking of nutrients and signaling molecules between the host coral and its symbiotic algae. To address these questions, we modified a method commonly used to study lysosomal acidification in mammalian systems (23) for use in coral cells involving the dye Lysosensor Green (LSG) DND-189, which accumulates in acidic compartments and fluoresces with increasing intensity as pH decreases (pK a 5.2).",

To exclude any damaged symbiosomes from our analysis, only coral gastrodermal cells containing two or more algal cells were used for fluorescence quantification in the symbiosome lumen ( Fig. 3 A-C). In addition, the use of cells containing multiple symbionts allowed for the visualization of the coral cell cytoplasm while avoiding any overlap of signal from the alga or symbiosome lumen. Following addition of LSG, there was low LSG fluorescence in the cytoplasm of the coral cells ( Fig. 3 A-C), consistent with previous observations that the cytoplasm of S. pistillata gastrodermal cells ranges from pH 7.1-7.4 (11) . In contrast, LSG consistently and brightly labeled the symbiosome lumen of isolated S. pistillata cells under both light and dark conditions ( Fig. S4 A and B) ; however, LSG fluorescence decreased as pH decreased below pH 4, reaching a minimum at pH 2 ( Fig. S4C ). Because LSG fluorescence in the symbiosome was as high or higher than the brightest point of the calibration curve, we conclude that pH in the symbiosome is \u223c4 both in the dark and in the light. However, fluorescence values above the brightest point in the calibration prevented determination of the exact pH of the symbiosome. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, this is the most accurate determination of symbiosome lumen pH to date, as previous estimates of symbiosome lumen pH indicated a pH <6 in both anemones and S. pistillata but could not determine a more precise value because the pH in this region was out of the range of the dye that was used (11) .",

To determine the role of VHA in acidification of the symbiosome lumen, isolated coral gastrodermal cells loaded with LSG were treated with the highly specific VHA inhibitor bafilomycin (24) and incubated in either light or dark conditions. Addition of 1 \u03bcM of bafilomycin induced a significant decrease of LSG fluorescence in the symbiosome lumen (Student's t test, P < 0.05; Fig. 3D ). Unfortunately, LSG dye calibration does not allow determining exact pH values, as mentioned above. However, assuming a basal pH of 4 and considering the linear response to pH above that value, inhibition of VHA with bafilomycin is consistent with an increase in average pH of at least 0.40 pH units in the light and 0.60 pH units in the dark (Fig.  3E ). Because the pH scale is logarithmic, these values correspond to a decrease in H + activity between 60% and 75%. Furthermore, the pH of the symbiosome was not uniform, instead presenting regions with brighter signal (and therefore more acidic; Fig. S5 A and B) . In these regions, bafilomycin increased pH by 1.2 and 0.8 pH units in the dark and light, respectively (decreases in H + activity between 95% and 84%, respectively; Fig. S5 C and D) . Interestingly, VHA immunostaining in isolated cells also displayed a punctuated pattern (Fig. 2 ), suggesting that the regions with the brighter LSG signal are due to increased VHA activity. The pH of the symbiosome lumen did not neutralize in the presence of bafilomycin after 30 min, indicating that either more time was required to reach neutral pH or an additional mechanism(s), such as the symbiosis-dependent Symbiodinium P-type H + -ATPase (25) , may contribute to acidification of the algal microenvironment.",

To determine if symbiosome acidification by VHA affects Symbiodinium photosynthesis, colonies of A. yongei and S. pistillata were incubated in the light with bafilomycin and the production of oxygen was measured over time ( Fig. 4 A and  B) . Inhibition of VHA with bafilomycin led to a significant decrease of net oxygen production in both coral species relative to the DMSO control (S. pistillata, 30%; A. yongei, 83%; Student's t test, P < 0.05; Fig. 4 C and D) . In contrast, photosynthesis rates of Symbiodinium freshly isolated from A. yongei were not significantly affected by bafilomycin ( Fig. S6 ; Student's t test, P > 0.05), confirming that VHA-stimulated photosynthesis is driven by the host. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the coral host actively promotes Symbiodinium photosynthesis through the acidification of the symbiosome lumen by VHA.",

                "text": "We propose that coral VHA is part of a CCM used by corals to promote Symbiodinium photosynthesis (26, 27) . Coral metabolic energy in the form of ATP present in the coral cytoplasm is consumed by VHA at the symbiosome membrane and used to transport protons from the cytoplasm of the coral cell (pH \u223c7) to the lumen of the symbiosome (pH\u223c4; Fig. 5A ). In addition, a plasma membrane H + -ATPase expressed by the algae only during symbiosis (25) may also contribute to the acidification of the symbiosome lumen (Fig. 5B ). Bicarbonate must also be transported to the symbiosome lumen from the coral cytoplasm, although the mechanisms for this are not known (Fig. 5C ). Within the symbiosome lumen, the low pH promotes the conversion of HCO 3 \u2212 to CO 2 , which occurs nearly instantaneously in the presence of CAs (Fig. 5) (26, 28) . This increases the local concentration of CO 2 surrounding the algal cell, which then diffuses across the algal cell wall and plasma membrane. In other organisms, this process may be facilitated by aquaporins; however, it is unknown if Symbiodinium express these proteins during symbiosis. Once inside the alga, this carbon must be transported to the site of photosynthesis within the chloroplasts (Fig. 5D ), which likely requires other CCM(s). Photosynthesis results in the production of oxygen, which diffuses out of the algal cell (Fig.  5E ), and sugars, which are translocated via unknown mechanisms to the coral host cell (Fig. 5F ). This VHA-dependent CCM presumably increases the amount of fixed carbon that the host receives, making up for the expenditure of ATP used to drive VHA activity. Furthermore, it may allow the coral host to regulate algal photosynthetic rates by changing VHA activity.",

Electrochemical gradients across membranes are used in a wide variety of cell and tissue types to drive fundamental physiological processes, including the transport of molecules across membranes such as ions (e.g., H + , Ca 2+ , Cl \u2212 , PO 4 2-, SO 4 2-), water, and nutrients (e.g., amino acids, glucose), and the formation of action potentials, intercellular signaling, and cell volume regulation (31, 32) . In the case of the coral symbiosome, acidification of the symbiosome lumen by VHA results in a sharp proton gradient across the outer symbiosome membrane to the coral cytoplasm and across the algal plasma membrane to the algal cytoplasm of \u223c1,000-fold [pH \u223c4 (this study) to pH \u223c7 (11, 33) ] in each direction. These proton gradients likely play an important role in facilitating the import and export of compounds between the symbiosome lumen, the coral cytoplasm, and the algal cytoplasm, making symbiosome acidification a potentially crucial characteristic of host-symbiont communication. For example, low symbiosome pH may drive ammonium transport into the symbiosome lumen by acidic \"trapping\" as described in the symbiosome of plant-bacterial symbioses (34) and in a variety of animal epithelia (35) (36) (37) . In the opposite direction, this gradient may help drive the transport of sugars from the symbiosome lumen into the coral cytoplasm.",

This is the first time, to our knowledge, that symbiosome pH dynamics in cnidarians has been measured, paving the way for future research on the cellular mechanisms involved in host-symbiont communication and metabolic exchange for this evolutionarily and ecologically important phylum. Determination of symbiosome pH in cnidarians has previously been elusive, partly due to the difficulty of working with live coral cells (11) . The pH range of the coral symbiosome lumen estimated here (pH \u223c4) is about 100 times lower than previous estimates in cnidarians (pH \u223c6) (15) and than in other symbioses (e.g., plant-rhizobium symbiosome compartments range from pH 5.5-6) (39). We show here that this low pH is partially generated by host VHA activity in the symbiosome membrane enveloping the algae. Hosts in other endosymbioses, such as plant-rhyzobium, have also been shown to acidify the symbiosome compartment, although the mechanism differs [plant P-type H + -ATPases (40) vs. coral VHA]. However, the acidic nature of the symbiosome lumen in corals likely shares some similar roles to those of other symbioses, including energizing the transport of various molecules across the symbiosome membrane (41) . Detailed physiological mechanisms such as these are important groundwork for understanding and predicting how corals will respond to environmental disturbances such as ocean warming, eutrophication, and acidification.",

Finally, the presence/absence and localization of VHA immunostaining was determined based on the red fluorescence from the secondary antibodies. Cells were divided into three subtypes: isolated Symbiodinium (one observable algal nucleus), a single Symbiodinium within a coral host cell (one algal nucleus and one host nucleus), or two Symbiodinium within a coral host cell (two algal nuclei and one host nucleus) (Fig. 2) .",

To determine symbiosome pH, gastrodermal cells were isolated from S. pistillata as described previously (11) and loaded with 1 \u03bcM of LSG D-189 (Life Technologies) dissolved in 0.45 \u03bcM of filtered seawater (FSW) for 30 min in the dark. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation to remove the dye and resuspended in FSW supplemented with either 1 \u03bcM of bafilomycin A1 or an equivalent volume of DMSO. Cells were then incubated for 10 min in the dark or 20 min in the light (290 \u03bcM) and imaged using a confocal microscope (Leica SP5). An excitation wavelength of 405 nm was used to minimize excitation of endogenous GFP, and emission was recorded at 505 nm. Only intact coral cells containing two or more algal symbionts were imaged to ensure that only intact symbiosomes were included in the analysis. These cells were selected under bright field to avoid observer bias based on LSG fluorescence. The microscope was focused at the cell \"equator,\" where the diameter of the Symbiodinium was the largest. Each cell was then imaged once with the laser to avoid bleaching of LSG fluorescence. The microscope was then returned to bright field mode, a separate field of view was selected, and the process was repeated for at least 15 cells. A total of four cell preparations taken from four different colonies were used for both light and dark experiments, resulting in the analysis of 60 coral gastrodermal cells and at least 120 symbiosomes for each treatment. The average LSG fluorescence intensity was determined from the images by drawing a region of interest around the entire symbiosome lumen, excluding the algal cell. The average symbiosome fluorescence for each coral cell was determined by averaging the symbiosome fluorescence of the symbionts contained within that coral cell. For LSG calibration, a range of pH buffers (pH 2-7) was used in conjunction with the ionophore nigericin (30 \u03bcM) to equilibrate intracellular pH in isolated coral cells as previously described, with the exception that Mes buffer was used for calibration buffers of pH 2-5.5 instead of Pipes (11) . These cells were loaded with 1 \u03bcM of LSG for in vivo calibration, and the intracellular LSG fluorescence was examined under either light or dark conditions as described above. This LSG calibration method has previously been used in mammalian lysosome pH studies (23) . The same laser intensity, gain, and magnification settings were used for all dark experiments and calibrations. The laser intensity and gain were adjusted for the light calibration to avoid overexposure under the \"dark settings,\" and these new \"light settings\" were held constant for each step of the light calibration. Settings were also kept consistent within each light experiment (i.e., each DMSO and corresponding bafilomycin treatment), but gain had to be adjusted between some cell preparations to avoid overexposure. The magnitude of the pH change observed following bafilomycin treatment was calculated from the slope of the corresponding standard curve: For the observed delta fluorescence, the corresponding delta pH was calculated.",

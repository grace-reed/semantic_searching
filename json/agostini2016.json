    "abstract": "Bleached corals (Porites cylindrica and Galaxea fascicularis) were obtained through extended incubation (over 45 days) under light depletion and privation: low light and dark conditions, and heat stress (32\u00b0C). The colonies in the different treatments became bleached and had reduced metabolic rates, photosynthesis, calcification and respiration; reduced biomass, zooxanthellae density, and chlorophyll a concentrations; and reduced mitochondrial electron transport system activity, which represent potential respiration rates. The most important reduction in mitochondrial electron transport activity was shown when the activities were normalized by the unit of surface and not by the unit of host protein. This result indicates that the reduction in activity could be mainly explained by the reduction of biomass and tissue thickness. However, increased Manganese Superoxide dismutase (Mn SOD) activity, a mitochondrial SOD, suggests that ROS production occurs in the mitochondria under heat stress with the consequence of potentially damaging the electron transport system. The reduced calcification rates observed are hypothesized to be the results of a decrease in the energy available for calcification due to the reduced photosynthetic rates, limiting the availability of substrates for respiration and therefore the energy production, and the decreased in the number of active mitochondrial electron transport system. Electron transport system activity associated with respiration is the basis of all metabolic processes and is not biased by incubation like traditional measurements of respiration in an aquarium. Therefore, ETSA could be used as an overall indicator of coral health, especially for host animal health.",

Aerobic respiration is divided in two phases: the oxidation of an organic substrate through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and the reduction of the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen. The transfer of electrons from the reduced co-factors, NADH and FADH2 produced during the oxidation phase is accomplished through a chain of enzymatic transporters embedded in the internal membrane of the mitochondria. Impairment of the mitochondrial machinery, especially the electron transport chain, will have strong repercussions on the respiration process and, subsequently, the metabolism of the organism.",

The most accepted model for the mechanism of bleaching proposes that it starts with the impairment of the zooxanthellae photosystems (Warner et al., 1999) , which leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Higuchi et al., 2010; Jones et al., 1998) . However, mitochondria and their electron transport system are also an important source of ROS in animals, and the mitochondrial production of ROS may not be negligible in corals (Downs et al., 2002) . This suggests that the importance of the host in the bleaching process may have been underestimated. Recently, Dunn et al. (2012) showed degradation of the host mitochondria in anemone under heat stress. This degradation was associated with the decreased expression of the gene coding for cytochrome c and complex IV, both of which are proteins that are important parts of the mitochondrial electron transport system. Corals incubated in the dark for a long period have also been shown to bleach (Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989; Tolleter et al., 2013; Yonge et al., 1930) . It has been shown that bleached corals have lower calcification rates independently of the cause of bleaching, whether due to heat stress, bacterial factors (Higuchi et al., 2013) or depletion of light. Corals incubated in total darkness for a long period have highly reduced calcification rates with only 10% of the light calcification rate after 7 h (Al-Horani et al., 2007) .",

The increase in the calcification rates under light for photosynthetic organisms is called light-enhanced calcification. On average, corals show three times higher calcification rates in the light than in the dark. Several hypotheses have been raised to explain this enhancement (these are reviewed in Allemand et al., 2004) . Among them, one proposal is that OH \u2212 resulting from photosynthesis titrate H + that is formed during the calcification process. For corals, photosynthesis is generally the main source of reduced carbon and is used as combustible for respiration and therefore for the production of the energy required for calcification, which could represent 30% of the coral's total energy budget (Cohen and Holcomb, 2009) . Inhibition of respiration (oxidative phosphorylation) has been shown to inhibit calcification in the light, which then falls to the same level as calcification in the dark (Chalker and Taylor, 1975) . In a recent paper (Agostini et al., 2013) , the respiration limited calcification model, which supports the models by Chalker and Taylor (1975) and, more generally, the Transcalcification model of McConnaughey (1997) was introduced. In this model the hypothesis made is that calcification in symbiotic coral is limited by the energy production through host respiration, itself limited by the ETSA and the amount of substrate for respiration produced by the photosynthetic activity of the symbiont.",

However, only a few are available for the host and are rather general, such as the lipid or protein content, or require incubation, such as respiration and calcification. Moreover, traditional respiration measurements also include symbiont respiration, which may bias the interpretation of the results. Therefore, coral biology is in need of tools to assess host health, and ETSA could be one of these tools.",

Reduced photosynthetic rates were obtained in two ways: corals were maintained under reduced light or exposed to a gradual elevation of temperature. The aim of this experiment is to first better understand the relationship of photosynthesis, respiration and calcification in corals, and second, to investigate the possibility of a direct effect of temperature on mitochondrial ETS, which leads to decreased growth rates. Two different hypotheses were made regarding the mechanisms that lead to a decrease in the respiration potential (ETSA) which both lead to reduced host metabolism (calcification and respiration). The first mechanism would be a decrease in the biomass based on tissue per unit of surface and tissue thickness, resulting in a reduction in the number of active ETS (expressed per unit of surface). The second, caused by damage due to heat stress, would be a decrease in the number of active ETS (expressed in per mg protein, representing the host biomass). Overall, the possibility of using ETSA as an indicator of coral health was tested.",

Simultaneous to bleaching, reduced photosynthesis and calcification rates were observed, as is commonly observed for bleached corals (Abramovitch-Gottlib et al., 2002; Colombo-Pallotta et al., 2010; Foster et al., 2014; Marshall, 1996) . All metabolic rates: net photosynthesis, dark respiration, and light and dark calcification, as expressed by the unit of the surface, were significantly affected by the different treatments in both species. Overall, the most visible effects were caused by the dark treatments for which severely reduced metabolic rates were observed. This treatment is however not realistic in nature and only provides elements to understand the physiology of corals. More variable responses were obtained for the heat and dim treatments. Low light level (Dim treatment) incubation of corals for over one month is also an extreme condition, but not unrealistic. It led to an important decrease in metabolic rates, including photosynthesis and calcification. Dark calcification was greatly reduced in the light depleted treatments, with net dissolution often observed. For the respiration rates, the observed decrease in all treatments compared to the control may have two different explanations that are not exclusive: respiration is limited by the availability of the substrate to oxidize and the number of working electron transport systems and enzymes required is decreased. It is interesting to note that for G. fascicularis, while the zooxanthellae density was lower in the heat treatment than in the dark and dim treatments, the metabolic rates of the corals in the heat treatment were still higher, which indicated a strong limitation of zooxanthellae by the energy light available and therefore a reduction in the production of available photosynthetate. The type of zooxanthellae typically found in G. fascicularis and P. cylindrica is known to differ possibly explaining the difference observed in the effect of the treatments. On the one hand, G. fascicularis has been shown to be associated with C1 or C3 zooxanthellae, C1 being known to be adapted to low light level (van Oppen et al., 2005 ) but sensitive to thermal stress (Baird et al., 2010) . Contrasting with P. cylindrica which could, as other species of the genus Porites in the Asia-Pacific region, be associated with the thermo-tolerant zooxanthellae from the clade C15 (D'Angelo et al., 2015) .",

The respiration rates also show a strong relation with photosynthesis. In the experiment reported here, the decrease in photosynthesis was always associated with decreased, sometimes severely decreased, as in the light depletion treatment, respiration rates. In a previous paper, the respiration limited calcification model was introduced. This model is similar to the trans-calcification model (McConnaughey, 1997) , but with a stronger focus on the role of respiration. This model implies that photosynthesis provides the substrates required for respiration, which then provide the energy required for calcification (Agostini et al., 2013) . In this study, the use of artificially bleached corals, allowed testing whether the model is still valid for a wider range of respiration rates. In the most extreme case (dark treatment), respiration was strongly limited by the availability of substrate and calcification was minimal or even resulted in net dissolution, which suggests that respiration may have limited calcification. The effects of the treatments on the light and dark calcification ratios were not clear for P. cylindrica because of the important variation due to the extremely low dark calcification rates. In G. fascicularis, the ratio decrease from 3 in the control treatment to less than 1 in the dim and heat treatments showed that the enhancement of calcification by light was removed due to the lack of photosynthesis and therefore supports the hypothesis that this enhancement is due to the photosynthetic activity.",

Typically, zooxanthellae and their photosynthetic apparatus are associated with the production of ROS; however, mitochondria and their electron transport systems are known to produce ROS under heat stress, at least in plants (Taylor et al., 2004) , and more damaged mitochondria were observed in heated stressed cnidarian, damages that may have been caused by ROS (Dunn et al., 2012) . In this paper, two different superoxide dismutase activities in the host tissues were measured: the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) which is a cytoplasmic SOD and the manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn SOD) which is found strictly in the mitochondria. The following hypothesis were made to assess the origin of the ROS produced under stress. In Fig. 3 . Mitochondrial electron transport activity (ETSA) normalized by the unit of the skeleton surface (A) and ETSA normalized by the milligrams of host protein (B) in P. cylindrica (black) and G. fascicularis (white). The error bars show the standard error (n = 4), and the star marks showed significant difference (*p b 0.05; **p b 0.001; ***p b 0.0001) with the control after multiple comparisons with the Kruskal Wallis and p-values adjusted by the Hochberg method. the case ROS mainly originates from the zooxanthellae due to the damage to their photosystems, the host Cu/Zn SOD should increase the most, and in the case ROS are mainly produced in the host mitochondria, then the Mn SOD should increase the most. In the last case, where mitochondria is the main source of ROS for coral host under stress, the ROS could result in damage to the host mitochondrial electron transport systems. The Mn SOD activity was found to significantly increase in the heat treatment in both species. The Cu/Zn SOD activity increased in both the dim and heat treatments in P. cylindrica, but was not increased in G. fascicularis. These results suggest that ROS were produced in the host mitochondria and that damage to the respiratory apparatus could have occurred. In the light depletion specimens, the Mn SOD and, in some cases, Cu/Zn SOD activities increased, but not as much as in the heat treated specimens. The mechanism behind the increase of SOD under depletion of light, and therefore possible ROS production in the host, remains unknown. It is usually considered that light is required for the production of ROS in zooxanthellae (Lesser, 1996) . Thus, zooxanthellae may not be the source of ROS under light depletion for some coral species, but the mitochondria may be.",

To investigate this, the activity of the electron transport system (ETSA) using the INT methods was measured (Agostini et al., 2013; Packard, 1971) . The interpretation of the ETSAs in the different treatments changes with the normalization used. To show a decrease in ETSA due to ROS damage, the activities normalized by the amount of host protein could be used with the assumption that they represent the host biomass and, consequently, the total number of ETS. While the treatment significantly affected the ETSA normalized by protein for both species, only P. cylindrica under the dim treatment was significantly decreased compared to the control. For G. fascicularis only the activities in the dim and dark treatments were significantly different. This result indicates that while possible direct damage to the mitochondrial electron transport system using the INT methods could be observed, the experiment could not sufficiently detect the decrease in ETSA for multiple comparison. Moreover, a more severe decrease was expected in the heat stress treatment than in the light depletion treatment, as the Mn SOD activities were higher in the heat treatment, but that was not always observed. One explanation may be that the production of ROS in the mitochondria damages part of the enzymes/transporters lower in the transporter chain. The tetrazolium salt INT is reduced to formazan by the cytochrome bubiquinone complex and before the complex III, which means that damage further down the chain may not always lead in decreased ETSA.",

ETSA has already been used for this purpose with other organisms (Finlay et al., 1983; Simcic, 2004) and is typically used to estimate the respiration rates of plankton (Ar\u00edstegui and Montero, 1995; Bamstedt, 1980; Packard, 1971) or the overall metabolism of meiofauna (Cammen and Corwin, 1990; Olanczukneyman and Vosjan, 1977; Wada et al., 2012) . Decreased ETSA in the different treatments and a strong correlation with metabolic rates was observed, confirming the previous results obtained with the same methods (Agostini et al., 2013) . The experiment conducted consisted of longterm exposure to the treatments. This led to a change in tissue biomass, which was shown by a reduction in the amount of protein per surface for the different treatments. Decreased tissue biomass: essential constituents of coral tissue and energetic reserve such as proteins, and lipids, is typical for bleached coral (Fitt et al., 2000; Rodrigues and Grottoli, 2007; Porter et al., 1989; Szmant and Gassman, 1990) . However, more than just a decrease in the reserve available to the coral host, this result shows that the observed decrease in biomass is associated with a decrease in ETSA. The reduction in ETSA could be due to a decrease in the number of mitochondria and therefore a decrease in the number of ETS. Therefore, ETSA can incorporate both the change in biomass or tissue thickness and the direct effect of stress on the mitochondrial electron transport system.",

The assumed reduced availability of the substrate for respiration results in the reduction of respiration and ETSA and, ultimately, to a reduction of calcification through the limitation of available energy. The increase in Mn SOD, which may correlate with the production of ROS in the mitochondria, was associated with decreased ETSA normalized by the host protein, which indicated damage to the mitochondrial electron transport system. More specific methods will be required, such as the measurement of the activities of the different complexes, to distinguish which step and enzymes are impaired by the different stresses. The measurement of ETSA by the INT methods is a simple and relevant way to assess the potential metabolism and therefore the health of corals and could be applied in field studies to provide a long needed tool to assess the state of the host animal in corals.",

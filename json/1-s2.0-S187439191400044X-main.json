Therefore, it is logical that the study of proteins should help uncover the various physiological metabolic pathways of cells. Proteomics involves a large-scale study of the structure and function of proteins in a complex biological sample [7] and, in contrast to conventional biochemical approaches, provides effective strategies and tools for profiling and identifying a number of proteins at a time, allowing simultaneous isolation and identification of hundreds to thousands of proteins in one sample. In the past few years, the proteomic approach has been applied to the study of dinoflagellates, and has shown its powerful potential with regard to revealing their essential physiological and metabolic characteristics. In this paper, we review the advancement of proteomics in the study of marine dinoflagellates (see Table 1 ), and discuss the challenges and opportunities of this approach for their future study.",

In this work flow, one or two-dimensional electrophoresis (1-DE or 2-DE) is used to separate proteins, followed by matrixassisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS) analysis. The protein samples are separated either by molecular mass (MW) directly, or by isoelectric focusing (IEF), followed by gel separation based on MW. However, there are several technical drawbacks of the current 2-DE method, such as poor identification of hydrophobic, extreme acidic/alkaline side, and high-molecular-weight (~200 kDa) proteins, which limit the application and intensive exploration of the whole-cell proteome [8] . Recently, a quantitative proteomic approach, two dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) has been introduced to dinoflagellate study [9] [10] [11] . Compared to the traditional 2-DE approach, a direct labeling of the lysine groups on proteins with cyanine dyes is involved before IEF proceeds to 2-D DIGE, and the use of a pooled internal standard increases the robustness of statistical analysis by reducing biological and experimental variations.",

After that, peptide analysis can be conducted through two operational approaches. A unique peptide mass fingerprint (PMF), measured as mass over charge (m/z), is provided by each peptide after MS analysis. Next, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis obtains a peptide fragment fingerprint (PFF) which contains the amino acid sequence that is created from further ionization of numbers of peptides. The linked PFF and PMF are combined to undergo a search in a given database. One approach relies on the existence of an organism-specific genomic, protein database, or an expressed sequence tag (EST) database. For unsequenced organisms, de novo sequencing analysis of peptides from PFF is performed, and the obtained amino acid sequence tag is used to search for homologies of proteins from other organisms. For the 2-DE approach, each protein spot is digested and searched, separately. For the liquid chromatography approach, a number of peptides are obtained from the digestion of proteins, and each peptide is fragmented using MS/MS. After searching the database, all the peptides matched to the same protein are later combined for further bioinformatics analysis.",

Homogenization with glass beads and sonication has been considered and compared [12] , and based on the results of 2-DE gel analysis, proteins obtained from both methods present similar results. With maximal agitation, the disrupting efficiency of sonication on ice is 10 times higher than that of glass bead homogenization. Furthermore, homogenization with glass beads is hard to operate so as to minimize heating and foaming which aerates the solution and causes proteins to denature. Sonication on ice is a better choice for its easy maneuverability and high protein yield compared with homogenization with glass beads, freeze-thaw lysis and osmotic shock.",

To achieve this, meticulous preparatory steps are necessary to remove high endogenous levels of salts, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, phenolic compounds, pigments and other interfering compounds in the dinoflagellates. All these compounds interfere with the IEF focusing process, and then bring about an invalid protein separation when using the 2-DE method. Different extraction buffers and reagents have been developed, compared and assessed by the standard of protein numbers, the definition of protein spots, and the background of the 2-DE gels. The protein preparation procedure for the proteomic study of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum triestinum has been compared and optimized [12] . The authors use four extraction buffers: (1) a non-denaturing Tris-buffer; (2) a denaturing urea containing lysis buffer; (3) a strong denaturing urea-thiourea cocktail buffer; and (4) protein precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (TCA)/acetone. After comparison of the 2-DE gels, the Tris buffer and TCA/acetone precipitation are the lowest in protein extraction efficiency, but their gel patterns are the best with sharp and clear spots. The urea-thiourea buffer and urea containing lysis buffer obtain the highest extraction efficiency, but fewer protein spots are separated. Similarly, four protein preparation methods for 2-DE analysis of Alexandrium tamarense are compared: (1) urea/Triton X-100 buffer extraction with TCA/acetone precipitation; (2) direct precipitation with TCA/acetone; (3) 40 mM Tris aminomethane buffer extraction; and (4) 50 mM Tris/5% glycerol buffer extraction [13] . Among them, the method combining the urea/Triton X-100 buffer and TCA/acetone precipitation obtains the highest number of protein spots with a clear background, but a bad separation and intensity of proteins is revealed in TCA/acetone precipitation. The 40 mM Tris buffer and 50 mM Tris/5% glycerol buffer methods detect fewer protein spots within a narrow pH range. Besides these, another study on protein extraction methods from dinoflagellates is also reported [14] . In this study, phenol/guanidine isothiocyanate (Trizol reagent), lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mM Tris pH 8.7) and acetone are used to extract the proteins from Alexandrium spp. and Scrippsiella spp., followed by sonication on ice for disrupting the cells. The Trizol extraction method results in the best resolution of stained spots with a clear background, and also the maximum protein spot numbers in 2-DE gels. Because of its high repetitiveness and low time consumption, the Trizol method has been applied in a number of protein extraction and proteomic studies of the dinoflagellates.",

Recently, with the fast development of MS technology, this limitation has been partially resolved by using a de novo sequencing strategy, in which partial or complete amino acid sequences are obtained using either manual or automated de novo peptide sequence analysis. A multilayered, gel-based, and underivatized strategy for de novo protein sequence analysis of dinoflagellates using MALDI-TOF/ TOF MS with DeNovo Explorer software has recently been developed [15] . In this study, MASCOT is applied as the first layer screen to identify either known or unknown proteins sharing identical peptides to those presented in a database. After searching against the NCBInr database, the confident identifications are removed, and the remainder searched against the dinoflagellate expressed sequence tag (EST) database. Finally, those borderline and non-confident hits are further subjected to de novo interpretation using DeNovo Explorer software. The de novo sequences passing a reliability filter are subsequently submitted to non-redundant MS-BLAST search. Using this method, 158 unique proteins are confidently or tentatively identified from A. tamarense. This approach provides a powerful tool to identify proteins from unsequenced dinoflagellates and has been successfully applied in various proteomic studies.",

The outbreak of dinoflagellate blooms includes four distinct phases: initiation, development, blooming and dissipation. As the final products of gene expression, a high dependency and specificity of proteins are found to vary with growth phases and some of these regulate cell division, proliferation and homeostasis. Therefore, studies on the growth regulation of dinoflagellates lay the background for the elucidation of the bloom mechanism and in situ bloom prediction. The protein expression profiles of P. triestinum at different growth phases were compared using the 2-DE approach, and the phase-specific proteins were identified [16] . Three groups of preblooming proteins and two groups of blooming proteins (BPs) are found to be highly expressed at the exponential growth phase, but their abundances decrease at the dissipation phase. Furthermore, a different protein expression pattern with fewer protein spots accumulate in the acid region and an apparent molecular mass ranging from 31 to 76 kDa is revealed at the late stationary phase. The authors postulate that these phase-specific proteins may play important roles in regulating cell growth and cell proliferation although their functions are not characterized. Protein expression variations of a toxic dinoflagellate, Alexandrium catenella, at different growth phases are also observed, and 30 proteins alter significantly in abundance at different growth phases [17] . These differentially expressed proteins are associated with macromolecular biosynthesis, photosynthesis, tRNA synthesis, DNA stability, stress response and cell division regulation. The phase-expressions of these proteins indicate that they play critical roles in maintaining the proper order and function of cell growth. In the dinoflagellate species, Lingulodinium polyedrum, a circadian expression of proteins is found [18] .",

Therefore, the study of cell cycle progression and its regulation may help to reveal the mechanisms underlying the growth and bloom formation of dinoflagellates. A proteomic analysis of P. triestinum in the exponential growth phase during a 24 h cell cycle reveals that the expressions of most proteins remain constant throughout the cell cycle [16] . However, levels of BP1 protein vary in accordance with the cell cycle. BP1 protein is up-regulated during the onset of mitosis and down-regulated after the completion of mitotic activities, indicating that this protein acts as \"specific trigger protein\" that regulates cell cycle progression in P. triestinum. Recently, a quantitative proteomic study on Prorocentrum donghaiense provides a valuable insight to cell cycle regulation of the dinoflagellates [9] . In this study, the protein profiles of P. donghaiense at four cell cycle phases (G1, S, early and late G2/M) were compared using the 2-D DIGE method and the differentially expressed proteins were identified using MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. 53 protein spots alter significantly in abundance at different cell cycle phases. Among them, 41 are involved in a variety of biological processes, e.g. cell cycle and division, RNA metabolism, protein and amino acid metabolism, energy and carbon metabolism, oxidation-reduction processes, and ABC transport. In the G1 phase, biological processes related to cell structure and motility, protein synthesis, photosynthesis and oxidation-reduction occur, while DNA synthesis, protein folding, glycolysis and membrane fusion are active in the S and G2/M phases. It is postulated that the periodic expression of these proteins is critical for the cell either to guarantee optimal utilization of resources or to maintain the proper order and functioning of the cell cycle. However, no cyclins or CDKs are found in this study, which may be due to their very low expression levels and their periodic expression within the cell cycle [20] . Actually, the cyclin and CDK genes are scarcely presented in the present DinoEST [6] .",

Alterations in protein expression patterns and specific proteins can be used to indicate the type or source of stressors, and some proteins can be selected as potential biomarkers. P. triestinum shows both constancy of protein profiles and variability of the relative abundance of some abundant proteins under different environmental conditions [16] . The protein profile of the nitrogen-limited culture is quite similar to that of the blooming stage and BP2 is highly expressed and unique in the nitrogen-limited condition. However, BP2 is found neither in phosphorus-limited nor light-stressed cells, indicating that the synthesis of BP2 may require the presence of phosphorus under optimal illumination. Another two groups of proteins (groups 1 and 2) with different response patterns are also noticed in response to environmental stresses. The differentially expressed protein patterns of P. triestinum under different growth conditions suggest that P. triestinum grown under nitrogen-limited condition possesses higher growth potential since its protein expression profiles are more similar to those of the blooming stage. Alteration of protein expression patterns under various growth conditions is also found in A. catenella [17] . The expressions of groups 1 and 2 proteins are low or barely visible in various growth conditions except in continuous darkness, when they are highly expressed. Group 3 proteins, on the other hand, are overexpressed in continuous illumination and expressed at low levels or barely visible in continuous darkness or under nitratestarvation. These differentially expressed proteins could be applied as potential physiological indicators related to environmental stresses.

Accelerated intrinsic nitrogen cycling proceeds through higher expressing proteins of tryptophanase, ubiquitin ligase, and proteasome that can degrade proteins into small molecular polypeptides.

Another proteomic study reveals that two plastid proteins, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO) form II and nitrogen-associated protein 50 (NAP50), are substantially down-regulated by nitrogen-depletion in the dinoflagellate Alexandrium affine [24] . Both of them are degraded sharply between 24 and 36 h following nitrogen depletion, however the degradation process can be blocked before it occurs and resynthesis will proceed immediately when nitrogen is replenished. NAP 50 is postulated to be used as a potential nitrogen biomarker in A. affine for its specificity of expression only in nitrogen deprived condition.

Approximately 2.3% of the detected proteins are differentially expressed in the different trophic modes and 12 proteins are observed only in the mixotrophic condition. Two proteins, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatase dehydrogenase and a bacterial catalase are specifically expressed in the autotrophic condition. Three mixotrophy-specific proteins show homology to certain hypothetical proteins from an insect and a bacterium. This study demonstrates that the mixotrophic dinoflagellates are able to switch on and off certain protein groups based on the ambient nutrient availability, which may be an adaptive mechanism of the dinoflagellates to environmental nutrient stress.",

A biomarker of toxicity, T1 protein, has been identified in toxic Alexandrium strains and its expression presents tight correlation to intracellular toxin content, indicating that it may be involved in STX production. However, the exact role of T1 in toxin biosynthesis remains unclear because of its unknown function and the fact that there are no elucidated gene sequences. Utilizing the 2D-DIGE approach, the proteomes of a toxin-producing A. catenella and its non-toxic mutant at the exponential growth phase were compared [11] . Proteins participating in toxin biosynthesis, such as polyketide synthase, histidine kinase and chaperone-like protein encoded by sxtA, sxtZ and sxtE, are identified to be down-regulated in the non-toxic mutant A. catenella. Moreover, some proteins which may depress or block reactions indirectly related to toxin synthesis are up-regulated, resulting in the loss of toxin-producing ability in the mutant, which suggests the complex and comprehensive features of toxin biosynthesis. Recently, protein expression profiles of A. catenella are compared at different toxin biosynthesis stages and the toxin related proteins are identified [33] . In this study, nine proteins with known functions in paralytic shellfish toxin-producing cyanobacteria, i.e. methionine S-adenosyltransferase, chloroplast ferredoxin-NADP + reductase, S-adenosylhomocysteinase, adenosylhomocysteinase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, sulfotransferase, alcohol dehydrogenase and arginine deiminase, vary significantly at different toxin biosynthesis stages, and they form a network of interactions, indicating their putative involvement in toxin biosynthesis. These studies suggest that the dinoflagellates might follow similar toxin biosynthesis pathways as the cyanobacteria. However, a recent study implies that cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates might evolve the independent STX biosynthetic pathway [34] . In short, the current results are somewhat inconclusive with regard to STX biosynthesis and more comprehensive studies should be devoted to it before we get the whole picture of STX biosynthesis in dinoflagellates.",

Traditional morphological approaches as well as molecular biological methods, i.e. 28S ribosomal DNA, 18S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, have been widely used in dinoflagellate species identification. However, these methods are still facing challenges in identifying morphologically similar or taxonomically confused species. Recently, the proteomic approach has been introduced to examine dinoflagellate species, and the 2-DE method is employed to compare the protein profiles of 10 species belonging to three dinoflagellate types: gymnodinioids, prorocentroids and peridinioids [35] . Species-specific protein expression profiles of the 10 species are obtained and proteomic reference maps are generated as standards for species identification. It should be pointed out that the reference maps need to be conducted under the same growth conditions, which limits its use with environmental samples. Combined with toxicity analysis, the proteomic approach is also applied to distinguish morphospecies of Alexandrium minutum. Significant differences are detected between toxic and non-toxic A. minutum strains. Groups of some abundant proteins, namely N1, N2, N3 and N4, are found only in the non-toxic strain, while proteins T1 and T2 occur specifically in the toxic strains. As potential markers, these obviously differentially expressed proteins successfully distinguish toxic from non-toxic strains [31] . Furthermore, the proteomic approach and western blotting are combined to classify phylogenetically close toxin-producing and non-toxic A. tamarense. With polyclonal antibodies against the potential toxin biomarker T1 protein, toxic A. minutum and A. tamarense strains are identified from non-toxic strains, in spite of their geographic origins or toxin contents [32] . The protein expression profiles of the A. tamarense complex comprising three morphospecies, A. tamarense, A. catenella and Alexandrium fundyense, were recently compared using the 2-D DIGE combined with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and DeNovo Explorer software [10] . In this study, eight ecotypes of the A. tamarense complex collected from different geographic locations were investigated and significant differences of protein expression patterns are observed among the three morphospecies. However, no obvious differences are found within ecotypes of each species. These results indicate that the A. tamarense complex can be classified into three species based on their protein expression map. Moreover, four isoforms of RuBisCO form II are found to shift in pI on 2-D DIGE gels among the three morphospecies, indicating the occurrence of mutation in the amino acid sequences. PMF analysis also demonstrates that several unique peaks are either absent or existing in maps of each species from the complex, based on which species identification is successfully conducted to distinguish the three morphospecies. The PMF spectral pattern or the protein/peptide expression profiles have also been used to classify dinoflagellate species [36, 37] . Based on specific PMF peaks, species which are phylogenetically distant or close are identified rapidly and precisely.",

However, there are few experimental data available for the cell wall of dinoflagellates compared with other organisms. Recently, a few efforts have been devoted to identify cell wall proteins (CWPs) and cell surface proteins (CSPs) using the proteomic approach. The CWPs from A. catenella were investigated using a combination of the 2D DIGE and MALDI TOF-TOF MS approaches [39] . Through sequential extraction and temperature shock, CWPs and protoplast proteins are separated from A. catenella. Through the comparison of sequentially extracted CWPs labeled with Cy3 and protoplast proteins labeled with Cy5, 120 CWPs are confidently identified in the 2D DIGE gel. These proteins give positive identification of protein orthologues in the protein database using de novo sequence analysis and homology-based search. Although the majority of CWPs are hypothetical or putative proteins with unknown function or no annotation, cell wall modification enzymes, cell wall structural proteins, transporter/binding proteins, and signaling and defense proteins are tentatively identified in agreement with the expected role of the extracellular matrix in cell physiology. Furthermore, a new protocol was developed for specific labeling and detection of the CSPs of A. catenella using DIGE fluorescent minimal dyes [40] . The CSPs are identified using 2-DE and MALDI TOF-TOF MS. The fluorescent cyanine dye Cy3 can specifically label the CSPs with a minimal labeling of the intracellular proteins. Forty-one CSPs are separated and identified from A. catenella and 14 of them are identified in the protein database using MALDI TOF-TOF MS analysis. Recently, the CSPs of A. affine and A. tamarense were investigated using the 2-DE immunoblot approach [41] . Theca-specific antibodies were raised against the dinoflagellates, 187 and 110 cell surface associated antigenic spots were identified from A. affine and A. tamarense, respectively. This immunoproteomic approach provides a tool for dinoflagellate CSP study, permitting a more in-depth elucidation of the relationship between dinoflagellates and environmental variables.",

For symbiotic dinoflagellates, the difficulty is to cleanly separate the gastrodermis and its symbionts from the epidermis. The reducing agent, N-acetylcysteine, is used to separate these two tissue layers from hermatypic corals without protein degradation, which increases the sensitivity of protein detection greatly [43] . 358 protein spots are identified in the amputated tentacle extract, while 417 protein spots are identified in the endosymbiotic zooxanthellae from Euphyllia glabrescens. This represents a percentage increase in sensitivity of 84.9% for endosymbiotic zooxanthellae compared to the protein spots detected in the tentacle. Also, three marker proteins are identified, including green fluorescent protein R7, Histone H2B and peridinin chlorophyll-a binding protein. The molecular basis of Symbiodinium sp. is revealed by the response of the coral Stylophora pistillata to the stress of trace metal limitation at different temperatures leading to a bleaching response in this coral [44] . S. pistillata was exposed to five conditions: (1) low temperature (28\u00b0C) plus all metals, (2) low temperature minus iron, (3) low temperature minus manganese, (4) high temperature (31\u00b0C) plus all metals, and (5) high temperature minus iron. The symbiotic dinoflagellates were isolated from day 0 to the end of the experiment at day 13. This process was carried out under low light conditions and on ice. Using high throughput quantitative proteomics, 8098 MS/MS spectra are acquired from the Symbiodinium-enriched fraction, but only 109 peptides meet the stringent criteria for quantification. 26 assigned peptides alter significantly in treated S. pistillata when compared to the pretreatment proteome. Of these, 12 peptides are up-regulated in high temperature treatments, but there is no significant change under iron limitation. Surprisingly, the viral replication protein significantly increases 114-fold.

                "text": "For marine dinoflagellate proteomics, the biggest challenge is protein identification and validation. As discussed above, protein identification relies largely on the availability of relevant genomic and proteomic sequences that generate mass spectra for searching. Despite its importance, the genome of the dinoflagellate is poorly characterized due to its permanently condensed, liquid-crystalline chromosomes and immense nuclear genome size. Moreover, the available dinoflagellate protein data is also very limited. So far, only 3879 and 3213 dinoflagellate proteins are annotated in the UniprotKB and NCBI databases (September, 2013). These factors increase the difficulty of protein identification. Approaches involving EST sequences, transcriptome and de novo sequencing can remit this situation and give support to proteomics. Several studies of EST sequences and the transcriptome of dinoflagellates have prepared the ground for further genome annotation and protein identification [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . De novo sequencing, a homologydriven tool to characterize the proteomes of organisms with unsequenced genomes, has also been applied in the dinoflagellates and shows its powerful potential in protein identification [15] . However, a homology-based identification only implies that statistically significant similarity between peptide sequence (s) in the query and sequence (s) in a database has been registered, and the identified proteins need further validation and the protein functions need demonstration with a clear biological experiment. Cloning and western blotting are two common methods to validate proteins, but both of them are challenged by the limitation of suitable gene sequences and antibodies from dinoflagellates. Recently, the draft assembly of a dinoflagellate nuclear genome was revealed [50] . 616 Mbp gene-rich DNA regions are assembled in Symbiodinium minimum, which presents roughly half of the estimated 1500 Mbp genome of this species and the assembly includes approximately 42,000 protein-coding genes. This work will shed light on further protein identification and validation in the dinoflagellates.",

To date, dinoflagellate proteomics are still predominantly performed using traditional gel-based separation methods, such as 2-DE and 2-D DIGE. Although 2-D DIGE improves sensitivity, dynamic range and reproducibility of protein quantification, the inherent shortcomings of a gel-based method limit its application in dinoflagellate study, such as a strong bias against hydrophobic proteins (i.e. membrane proteins) and proteins with an extreme isoelectric point and/or molecular weight. Moreover, the complexity of dinoflagellate samples often exceeds the resolution of conventional 2-DE leading to co-migration of different proteins in one gel spot which is likely to hinder high accuracy and specificity of protein quantification. Recently, the rapid development of various gel-free quantitative proteomic techniques, e.g. iTRAQ and ICAT, might be well employed in marine dinoflagellate proteomics [51] . These methods directly digest proteins into peptides and then separate the peptides through liquid chromatography (LC), owning a large dynamic protein separation range, and have been widely applied in various organisms.",

Proteomic comparison of co-existing phytoplankton species and their response to environmental factors in the field should be conducted to reveal the blooming genetics and niche of dinoflagellate species in specific environments. Moreover, comprehensive proteomic studies of different dinoflagellate species under various environmental conditions in the laboratory will help to reveal the genetic and physiological characteristics of the dinoflagellates and their response mechanisms to the changing environment. Secondly, the toxin biosynthesis mechanism is still unclear. A comprehensive comparison of toxic and non-toxic species will be a better choice for functional protein screening and the identification of proteins that are involved in toxin biosynthesis and metabolism. Moreover, comparative proteomics of toxin-producing dinoflagellates at different toxin producing stages and under different growth conditions will also provide useful information on toxin biosynthesis. Thirdly, the impacts of global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance, such as eutrophication, on dinoflagellates should be evaluated. Global seawater warming and ocean acidification normally alter both the marine ecosystem through reducing the carbon flow from particulate organic carbon to dissolved organic carbon and the calcification rates of those calcareous dinoflagellate species. Whether the occurrence of dinoflagellate blooms and population succession will increase in the coming years should be assessed under climate change and increasing eutrophication. Comprehensive proteomic studies under multiple environmental stresses will help to reveal the basis of dinoflagellate bloom occurrence and assess the impacts of environmental change on marine dinoflagellate roles and their eco-functions.",

                "text": "It is known that most essential proteins such as cyclins, kinases, and signaling proteins exist in low abundances with specific subcellular localization. Moreover, protein-protein interactions or target proteins also present specific subcellular structures. Currently, there is no single proteome analysis strategy that can sufficiently address all levels of the proteome organization. Recently, however, the emergence of subcellular proteomics shed some light on resolving this issue [52, 53] . The combination of target organelle selection and subcellular prefractionation methods will reduce the complexity of protein extracts from dinoflagellates prior to proteomic analysis. This will often allow the identification of many lower abundance proteins of the target proteome and it may involve the selection of specific organelles and cell types or the isolation of specific subcellular components. These subcellular proteomes may provide insight into their function following various impacts and also contribute to the wider understanding of the whole organismal proteome. On the other hand, the fact that most proteins display posttranslational modifications further adds to the complexity of proteomics and is increasingly seen as essential to any study [54] . However, so far, there has been no study on this issue involving marine dinoflagellates. Considering the biologically important roles of some modifications, such as methylation, phosphorylation, glycosylation and sulfation, post-translational modifications will be one of the main streams in dinoflagellate proteomic study, and this will help to reveal the protein functions involved in cell growth, nutrient utilization, toxin biosynthesis, stress response and other physiological functions.",

In future, the combination of new intriguing methods in quantitative MS with cell biological, biochemical, genetical and/or transcriptomic approaches will deepen our understanding of the dinoflagellates. We can foresee that areas such as proteogenomics may become a powerful approach in identifying proteins and in studying various physiological and metabolic activities.

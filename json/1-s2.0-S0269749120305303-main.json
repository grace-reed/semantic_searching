They occupy less than 0.1% of the world's ocean surface, yet they provide a home for 25 percent of all marine species, representing an important reservoir for biological diversity (Sebens, 1994) . In fact, more than 15% of the world's human population depends on coral reefs for its livelihood. Scleractinian corals are fundamental for the formation of these ecosystems. The symbiosis between corals and dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae is indeed at the basis of the success of coral reef ecosystems in nutrient-poor tropical waters (LaJeunesse et al., 2018) . The dinoflagellate symbionts perform photosynthesis and up to 95% of the photosynthates in shallow waters can be translocated to the coral host, for its own energetic, respiratory and growth needs (Muscatine et al., 1981; Tremblay et al., 2012) .",

Corals are particularly affected by elevated temperatures, which induce the breakdown of the symbiotic relationship (loss of symbionts and decrease in photosynthetic pigments or photosynthetic efficiency), a phenomenon known as coral bleaching (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007) . In fact, many coral reefs are expected to be lost due to mass coral bleaching events caused by global warming and increased frequency in heat waves (Hughes et al., 2018) . Local stressors associated with overharvesting and coastal development (urban and agricultural) also pose a major threat to coral reefs (De'ath et al., 2012; Hughes et al., 2018) . For example, corals from the Red Sea reefs were shown to be particularly resistant to seawater warming (Fine et al., 2013) ; however, such resistance is lowered by coastal pollution (Banc-Prandi and Fine, 2019) or Artificial Light at Night (hereafter ALAN), which has quickly become acknowledged as a crucial factor altering the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems in ways that urgently need to be explored (Ayalon et al., 2019; Davies et al., 2014) .",

                "text": "The natural illumination at night is derived from the moon, the stars and the Milky Way. However, over the past decades, in many coastal areas, these natural light levels have been significantly altered by anthropogenic light sources emitted by over-lit cities (ALAN) (Cinzano et al., 2001; Duarte et al., 2019; Falchi et al., 2016; Kamrowski et al., 2014; Longcore and Rich, 2004) . Indeed, the growth of the human population in coastal zones is occurring at faster rates than elsewhere (Nicholls, 1995) ; therefore, coastal habitats have become some of the most vulnerable habitats to light pollution (Bird et al., 2004; Garrett et al., 2019) . Approximately 22% of coastlines (Davies et al., 2014) and 35% (20% across their entire area) of marine-protected areas (Davies et al., 2014; Gaston et al., 2017) around the world, including coral reef systems in strongly urbanized locations (Aubrecht et al., 2008; Tamir et al., 2017) , experience the intense impacts of ALAN. ALAN pollution disrupts the signals emitted by natural light sources, and daily light/night cycles, which both play a fundamental role in behavioral patterns of marine and terrestrial organisms and the timing of ecological processes (Gaston et al., 2017; Gaston et al., 2013) . Indeed, in coral reef ecosystems many organisms are governed by light-dark cycles, such as the expansion-contraction behavior in anthozoans to conserve nutrients (Levy et al., 2001; Sebens and DeRiemer, 1977) , the diel migrations of zooplankton, and planktivorous fish (Yahel et al., 2005) . Scleractinian corals, like other marine invertebrates, orchestrate reproduction with the moon phases (Bentley et al., 2001) . Light stimuli can be detected by corals through photosensitivity rhodopsin-like pigments that have been localized in their larvae aboral region (Mason et al., 2012) , and by cryptochromes localized in the ectoderm of both larvae and adults (Levy et al., 2007) . To operate their photosynthetic machinery, corals also require complete darkness at night for repair processes (Hill et al., 2011) . Therefore, ALAN may critically disrupt natural dayenight cycles, which are imperative photoperiods that inform the behavior of marine species (Duarte et al., 2019) .",

Interestingly, a higher susceptibility to oxidative stress (which is linked to bleaching) has been reported for different light pollution wavelengths in the corals Pocillopora damicornis and Acropora eurystoma (Ayalon et al., 2019) . However, the actual impact on thermally-resistant coral taxa and the mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects on coral physiology remain largely unknown. We are at a time-critical point where we must resolve how coral bleaching patterns emerge from complex biological-environmental networks. In this context, further investigation is needed to link ALAN pollution, coral bleaching and oxidative stress levels (Suggett and Smith, 2020) . We thus chose two scleractinian corals species representative of the Red Sea and known for their resistance to thermal stress, Stylophora pistillata (Pocilloporidae) and Turbinaria reniformis (Dendrophylliidae), to further investigate the effects of ALAN on a set of relevant physiological (symbionts and chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, respiration, corals pigment profile and skeletal growth) and biochemical (ROS production, antioxidant capacity and lipid damage) parameters. We exposed corals for 8 weeks to LED lights at an intensity level (1e1.2 mmol photons m \u00c02 s \u00c01 ) mimicking ALAN levels received by some of the most light polluted reefs (Aubrecht et al., 2008) , and slightly higher than the ALAN levels measured in the northern part of the Red Sea (Gulf of Aqaba/Eilat, Israel, 0.8 mmol photons m \u00c02 s \u00c01 , Tamir et al., 2020; Levy personal communication measured light levels of up 1.5 mmol photons m \u00c02 s \u00c01 in corals placed close to seawater surface near Eilat city, which is a very lit area).",

These two species were chosen due to their high abundance in Red Sea reefs (Rapuano et al., 2017; Benayahu and Loya, 1977) , their different shapes (branching versus foliar) and their particular resistance to seawater warming (Fine et al., 2013) . Sixty coral nubbins per species (coral fragments of~5 cm cut from 6 mother colonies, 10 per colony) were prepared, and equally distributed into 12 open-flow 20 L aquaria (seawater renewal of 5 L h \u00c01 ). During a 3-week healing period (necessary for the tissue to cover again the skeleton), corals were maintained at 25 C, under a constant PAR (photosynthetic active radiation) of 200 mmoles photons m \u00c02 s \u00c01 (~14200 lux) provided by 400 W metal halide lamps (HPIT, Philips). A 12:12 (Light:Dark cycle) was set up and PAR was measured using a LI-COR data logger (LI-1000) connected to a spherical quantum sensor . Measurements were performed on the surface of the aquaria. Temperature was maintained, using heaters connected to ElliWell PC 902/T controllers and seawater was continuously mixed using small underwater pumps. Nubbins were fed twice a week with Artemia salina nauplii. After 3 weeks, aquaria were divided into two control and light-polluted treatments (6 aquaria per treatment). Control tanks remained under the conditions described above under complete darkness at night (8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.). Light polluted tanks were maintained under the same conditions, except that they received at night (from 8:00 p.m.",

Corals, which were hung in the middle of the aquaria, therefore received ca. 1e1.2 mmoles photons m \u00c02 s \u00c01 . White LED lamps were chosen considering that the white spectrum is the most common light pollution source currently used in our society (Gaston et al., 2013) . Further, a study published by Tamir et al. (2017) reported that the urbanization of the shores of the Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat, Israel), Red Sea, has exposed the marine environment there, including unique fringing coral reefs, to strong anthropogenic light sources. In situ measurements showed that the main spectral irradiances penetrating seawater were mostly Blue and Yellow. Both wavelengths are emitted by White LED lights, making their use in our experimental set-up of significant ecological relevance for Red Sea coral reefs (Tamir et al., 2020) .",

In dark-acclimated corals, this parameter provides a convenient and reliable indication of the photosystem II (PSII) activity in dinoflagellates (Jones et al., 1999) . A decreased ratio indicates loss in the efficiency of photochemical energy conversion and/or damage in the PSII (Jones, 2005) . After dark adaptation (15 min), the initial fluorescence (F 0 ) was determined by applying a weak modulated pulse of red light (6 mmol m \u00c02 $s \u00c01 ). A 0.8 s saturating pulse (SP) of actinic light (intensity of z 4000 mmol photons m \u00c02 s \u00c01 ) was then applied to measure the maximum fluorescence level (F m ). F V /F M values were calculated at the end of the dark incubation as (F m eF 0 )/F M .

A saturating pulse (2s, intensity of 3200 mmol photons m \u00c02 s \u00c01 ) was delivered by an array of 6 red LEDs (peak wavelength 650 nm), on a coral area of 4 mm in diameter.

The minimum fluorescence (F 0 ) was measured at 0.05 ms, and the maximal fluorescence (F m ) was recorded after a 2000 ms sampling period.

The other end of the optic fiber bundle was placed at 1 cm distance of the coral surface. Half of the fibers are dedicated to excitation light from the fluorometer, and the other half receives light emitted from the fluorescent pigments consequently to excitation. Excitation and emission fibers are randomly mixed inside the bundle. Fluorescent pigments are abundant in corals, and the host is known to produce fluorescent proteins (FP) closely related to the green fluorescent proteins that are known to be photoprotective in corals (Salih et al., 2000) . FPs exhibit a high diversity in corals relying on species or environmental situation giving a fluorescent signature to any of them. This signature can be expressed by exposing corals to a set of excitation wavelengths through the optical fiber bundle and recording the emission peaks that result from them. After preliminary tests with excitation from UV to IR, we focused our measurements on emission spectra with excitation at 465 nm that induced emission fluorescence of two potential FP at 488 nm and 560e580 nm. In addition to FPs, the main emission peak of the chlorophyll was recorded at 680 nm. To overcome the natural variability of the fluorescence in a single body due to external factors such as position in the tank or shadowing by other nubbins, we performed measurements at two different locations on each nubbin dedicated to FP profile analysis (n \u00bc 6 per condition). Measurements were made at three different periods (after 60, 90 and 120 days) of exposure. Results are presented as average \u00b1 standard error of the fluorescence peaks obtained for each condition and exposure time.",

Fluorescence was measured using a spectrofluorometer (Xenius spectrofluorometer).

Also, ROS production varied over time in the LP Increased TAC was observed after 120 (T3) days in corals under LP compared to control condition (ANOVA, p < 0.04), and increased LPO in the LP treatment was observed after 90 (T2) and 120 (T3) days (ANOVA, p < 0.002).",

                "text": "Assessing and managing the impact of Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) or Light pollution (LP) in urbanized costal zones is a requirement to prevent degradation of marine ecological systems, like coral reefs (Aubrecht et al., 2008; Ayalon et al., 2019; Colman et al., 2020; Davies et al., 2014; Rosenberg et al., 2019a,b) . However, studies on the effects of LP on the molecular and physiological levels in scleractinian corals are scarce (see Ayalon et al., 2019; Rosenberg et al., 2019a,b; Tamir et al., 2020) . A key difficulty in experimental studies of ALAN is indeed to match the ALAN levels received by marine organisms in their natural environment, while these levels significantly vary on small geographical scales and are still unknown for many marine environments. Another difficulty is to predict the effects of ALAN in a few weeks experiment while ALAN, in nature, is continuously applied on organisms. In this experiment, we applied levels of ALAN slightly higher than those measured on the reefs of Eilat (1e1.2 versus 0.8 mmoles photons m \u00c02 s \u00c01 ). Yet, the Red Sea reefs are not the most polluted reefs, and those of Puerto Rico or Singapore are likely to reach the ALAN levels applied here (Aubrecht et al., 2008) . Since light pollution at night is continuously and drastically increasing, this study represents scenarios that are already happening, or will soon happen, in many coastal reefs. Overall, we provide further evidence that exposure to light at nighttime during a few weeks causes a disruption of the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis. This statement is first based on the fact that corals exposed to ALAN presented a reduction in the overall concentrations of symbionts and photosynthetic pigments. Such responses could be the result of photoacclimation; however, both a clear oxidative stress condition, together with a significant decrease in the photosynthetic capacities, both at the organismal and symbiont cell levels, were also experienced by corals. Considering that oxidative stress is the main trigger of coral bleaching, including in stressful light regime situations (Suggett and Smith, 2020) , and that symbionts have also lost their photosynthetic efficiency, these observations come in strong evidence that ALAN is causing the disruption of the coral-dinoflagellates symbiosis. Most importantly, we show that the species-dependent response to ALAN is related to the severity of the oxidative stress experienced by the coral holobionts (coral animal and its counterparts; bacteria, fungi, viruses, and the symbiotic algae).",

The main consistent effect on corals (independent of the species considered) was a significant decrease in PSII efficiency (F V /F M ), also imaged by the decrease in photosynthesis rates per symbiont cell. This is likely due to photoinhibition, a process that occurs when photo-damage exceeds PSII repair (Takahashi et al., 2009) . Since efficient photosynthesis is of major importance for the acquisition of energy in corals (Muscatine and Porter, 1977) , the observed decrease in photosynthesis (at the holobiont and symbiont cell level) under ALAN may affect coral survival in the long-term. The rate of photodamage to PSII is proportional to the intensity of incident light; therefore, ALAN may submit corals to a light-excess condition likely because endosymbionts photosynthetic machinery needs complete darkness for repair processes during night-time (Hill et al., 2011) .",

Accordingly, the observed decrease in coral photosynthesis under ALAN was in line with an oxidative stress condition, which was evidenced by: (i) overproduction of ROS, (ii) TAC induction and (iii) increased lipid damage (LPO). Such findings are consistent with those presented by Ayalon et al. (2019) , who observed an oxidative stress condition in Pocillopora damicornis and Acropora eurystoma exposed to blue (420e480 nm), white (400e700 nm) and yellow (580e620 nm) spectra, under the same intensity tested here (~40 lux). Substantial evidence has demonstrated that oxidative stress e when the antioxidant capacity of an organism is overwhelmed by excessive ROS production e is pivotal in the process of coral bleaching, and leads to several cellular toxicity processes (Lesser, 2006; Suggett and Smith, 2020) . In the present study, higher levels of TAC indicate that excessive ROS production in the ALAN condition has stimulated the antioxidant machinery of corals. However, this compensatory response was not sufficient to counteract the high occurrence of lipid peroxidation (LPO), which is known to be cytotoxic, with multiple effects on certain enzymes, ATP production, as well as on the initiation of apoptosis (Ayala et al., 2014) . After 120 days under ALAN, ROS levels however decreased compared to the initial level due to increased TAC levels in the two coral species. Regarding S. pistillata, ROS decrease can also be explained by the lower symbiont density and rates of photosynthesis, as a higher density of symbionts may contribute to more ROS generation on a per cell basis, which is related to generation of photosynthetic oxygen (Cunning and Baker, 2013; Nesa and Hidaka, 2009) . Also, by the end of the experiment, S. pistillata corals under control condition presented a decreased in TAC of~21%. This is in accordance with the decreases of~35% and 28% in ROS and LPO, respectively, in the same condition (despite not statistically significant). Such oscillation in the oxidative status of corals must be related to the slight physiological changes also observed in the control condition regarding symbiont density, chlorophyll concentration and F V /F M values. However, these changes didn't have a significant effect at the end of the experiment on the main physiological parameters such as photosynthetic rates per skeletal surface area or symbiont cell, photosynthetic efficiency and host pigmentation.",

                "text": "The extent of the deleterious effects of ALAN on coral symbiosis and physiology was however different according to the species considered. Such difference was linked to a different oxidative stress response of corals, which could have been related to the amount of symbionts in the coral tissue. Indeed, it has been shown that excess algal symbionts, increases the coral susceptibility to bleaching, due to the generation of higher ROS quantities (Cunning and Baker, 2013) . Overall, S. pistillata, which contained more symbionts per cm \u00c02 than T. reniformis, was also more sensitive to ALAN, with a higher decrease in symbiont density and photosynthetic rates. This later decrease was linked to an overall reduction in PSII efficiency (F V /F M ) and performance index (PI total ), while T. reniformis did not show significant effects over PI total . PI total is a stress-sensitive fluorescence parameter (Strasser et al., 2010) , and its decrease indicates impaired PSII photochemistry and reduced PSI availability for accepting electrons from PSII (Oukarroum et al., 2015) . In this case, a reduced electron transport chain resulting from loss of PSII activity and damage of PSI function provides a possible explanation for the decreased photosynthetic performance evidenced by the PI total index (Strasser et al., 2010; Oukarroum et al., 2015) . Also, it is worth noting, despite being statistically non-significant, mean calcification rates of S. pistillata were also 10% lower after 120 days under ALAN. Regarding ROS production, S. pistillata also experienced increased ROS and TAC levels 60 days before T. reniformis. Also, LPO levels increased by 110% compared to control levels in S. pistillata, and only by 40% in T. reniformis. ROS scavenging action is dependent on both reactivity and concentration of antioxidants (Apak et al., 2007) , and the measure of the antioxidant capacity of a tissue or organism should provide a better understanding of its resistance to toxicity caused by ROS (Gorbi and Regoli, 2003) . It is possible to infer that the lower LPO occurrence under ALAN observed for T. reniformis may be related to the higher basal levels of TAC observed for this species (267 \u00c2 10 3 mM CRE/mg protein), which were here shown to be approximately 93% higher compared to S. pistillata (18 \u00c2 10 3 mM CRE/mg protein).",

                "text": "It is worth noting that the present study evaluated the nonenzymatic antioxidant system of corals, which corresponds to soluble low molecular weight antioxidants. Interestingly, such antioxidants were shown to be responsible for the major protective potential (accounting for 70e80%) of cytosolic antioxidant capacity against peroxil radicals (ROO ) in invertebrates, including the sea anemone Bunodosoma cavernata (Regoli and Winston, 1998) . Also, recent studies showed (i) that adaptations linked to coral antioxidant capacity drive differences in coral species tolerance to thermal stress (Gardner et al., 2017) and (ii) a possible causal link between antioxidant basal levels and bleaching susceptibility (Marangoni et al., 2019) . In this context, we suggest that coral species with higher basal levels of antioxidant capacity, such as observed for T. reniformis in the present study, may be less susceptible to ALAN and probably to other anthropogenic stressors than S. pistillata. Further, considering that (i) Ayalon et al. (2019) showed preliminary evidence that the higher sensitivity of P. damicornis to ALAN compared to A. erystoma is not directly related to the coral host symbiotic algae; and (ii) that differences among host species in their capacity to utilize their antioxidant systems and stress enzymes may determine differences among coral species to stress (Baird et al., 2008) ; it is likely that the coral host potential to counteract ROS formation (antioxidant capacity) may be of great relevance against ALAN effects.",

                "text": "Fluorescent pigments (FP), which are highly abundant among coral hosts, are able to reduce photo-inhibition by absorbing, scattering and dissipating radiation via fluorescence (Salih et al., 2000) . Since corals were exposed to constant light (during the day and during the night) and the white LED lights used in the present study have a shoulder in the blue spectrum, we postulate that ALAN has altered the fluorescent pigments as indicated by our pigment profile results. It is worth noting that blue light can also impact the coral host biological clock and rhythmicity due to the presence of cryptochromes (blue light photoreceptors) and rhodopsin like receptors (Levy et al., 2007; Rosenberg et al., 2019a Rosenberg et al., , 2019b , as well as spawning synchronicity (Kaniewska et al., 2015) . A significant increase in the fluorescence of T. reniformis under ALAN until the end of the experiment was observed, while S. pistillata presented a transient increase for blue pigments after 60 days of exposure. Such pronounced and more stable increase in pigments observed for T. reniformis may be related to its higher tolerance to nighttime light, however, further studies are needed to better characterize which fluorescent proteins are involved in such response. Also, mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), which are more abundant in host tissues, can absorb and dissipate UV energy as heat without the formation of toxic intermediates (Shick and Dunlap, 2002) . Thus, despite the antioxidant system and the potential of the coral host to produce FP, the acquisition via heterotrophic feeding of MAAs could also help explaining the different susceptibilities of coral species to ALAN. Such parameters should be considered in future studies, since those can contribute to the reduction of light flux to symbionts (Baird et al., 2008) and avoid photo-inhibition. The results of those two-coral species also imply adaptive plasticity to ALAN, which can be manifested more clearly in T. reniformis in comparison to S. pistillata and previous corals studied by Ayalon et al. (2019) and Rosenberg et al. (2019a,b) .",

Findings here clearly show that light at night, may cause photoinhibition and oxidative stress in corals on the long term. The extent of deleterious effects on the symbiotic partnership and physiology was related to the severity of the oxidative stress condition experienced by the two corals species tested. Indeed, S. pistillata, which experienced a more severe oxidative stress condition, also had more pronounced effects on symbiosis and physiology. The symbiosis between corals and dinoflagellates is at the basis of coral reef ecosystems (LaJeunesse et al., 2018) , and ALAN may significantly impair the stability of such symbiosis. Therefore, ALAN can severely impact the health and future of entire reef ecosystems located near urban and lit areas, especially if ALAN levels continue to increase in the future and corals are exposed to higher levels than they are now. The threats on the coraldinoflagellate symbiosis will be even greater if cities will be illuminated throughout the night, without periods of light switch off. Finally, considering that we are facing an era of climate change and that environmental stressors, such as increasing temperature, can accelerate photoinhibition in corals (Takahashi and Murata, 2008) , future studies should be undertaken to elucidate the potential synergetic effects of LP and global climate change stressors. Also, other local stressors, such as chemical pollution, are of great concern in many coastal reefs (van Dam et al., 2011) . Such scenario, combining different sources of chemical pollution and LP, should be also addressed in future studies. ",

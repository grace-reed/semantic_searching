    "abstract": "The mammary gland (MG) undergoes functional and metabolic changes during the transition from pregnancy to lactation, possibly by regulation of conserved genes. The objective was to elucidate orthologous genes, chromosome clusters and putative conserved transcriptional modules during MG development. We analyzed expression of 22,000 transcripts using murine microarrays and RNA samples of MG from virgin, pregnant, and lactating rats by cross-species hybridization. We identified 521 transcripts differentially expressed; upregulated in early (78%) and midpregnancy (89%) and early lactation (64%), but downregulated in mid-lactation (61%). Putative orthologous genes were identified. We mapped the altered genes to orthologous chromosomal locations in human and mouse. Eighteen sets of conserved genes associated with key cellular functions were revealed and conserved transcription factor binding site search entailed possible coregulation among all eight block sets of genes. This study demonstrates that the use of heterologous array hybridization for screening of orthologous gene expression from rat revealed sets of conserved genes arranged in chromosomal order implicated in signaling pathways and functional ontology. Results demonstrate the utilization power of comparative genomics and prove the feasibility of using rodent microarrays to identification of putative coexpressed orthologous genes involved in the control of human mammary gland development.",

Nonetheless, to date, regulation of mammary gland development during pregnancy and lactation is incompletely understood. Lactation is regarded as one of the most remarkable products of evolution whose processes include the development of mammary tissue as well as the synthesis and secretion of milk [2] . Consequently, despite the fact that the development of mammary tissue and the synthesis and secretion of milk are considered as complex dynamic physiological processes, both must preserve overall common characteristics among mammals.",

In order to determine the integrity of the dissected inguinal mammary glands, a gross histological evaluation of the characteristic cytomorphological features were determined through hematoxylin-eosin staining ( Figure 1 ). Four time points (pregnancy days 5 and 14; lactation days 1 and 12) were selected to represent distinct periods in mammary gland development. Histologically, the mammary proliferative stage is represented by P5, the secretory differentiation stage by P14, early lactation by L1, and full lactation by L12. As reported elsewhere [13] , initial changes observed during pregnancy include an increase in ductal branching and the formation of alveolar buds (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). The latter half of pregnancy is characterized by the expansion of alveolar buds to form clusters of lobuloalveolar units followed by the differentiation of these structures into presecretory structures. By day 14 of pregnancy, there is a readily apparent increase in the size of the epithelial compartment (Ep) (Figures 1(e) and 1(f)), and expansion of the epithelium (whereas the adipose compartment decreases) continues until the epithelial compartment predominates by onset of lactation (Figures 1(g ) and 1(h)). By day 12 of lactation in the rat, the mammary gland is producing copious amounts of milk [7] . As expected, examination of the histology of the mammary gland at this stage reveals prominent luminal structures (L) and ducts and few adipocytes visible at this time (Figures 1(i) and 1(j)).",

The expression profiles of the 807 genetic elements resulted in six predominant clusters on a dendogram (designated clusters 1-6 in Figure 3 ). All the gene cluster sets are enumerated in Table S4 . Cluster 1 (C1) represents 37.35% of the total 807 genetic elements. This major trend is a decline in gene expression during mid-pregnancy that remains low during lactation. Cluster 2 (C2) describes 25.77% of the total data population and is characterized by a linear decrement in gene expression towards mid-lactation. However, positive z-score values are retained with respect to the reference stage (virgin). The remainder of the clusters (C3-C6) appears to explain between 3.09 and 17.84% of the data variation. In C3 and C4, gene expression rises exponentially from early pregnancy, reaching a plateau during mid-lactation. However, the slope of the curve is even steeper in C3 in comparison to C4. In cluster (C5), 65 elements matched the profile outline (inverted sigmoid form) of major trend C1 although the reduction tendency was less marked.

K-means clustering revealed six distinct clusters (K1-6) that distinguished up from down, early from middle, and transient from sustained changes in expression ( Figure 4 ; Table S5 ). Each of the six clusters was designated with its unique trajectory expression profile signature across stages (pregnancy days 5 and 14, lactation days 1 and 12) as presented in Figure 4 .",

                "text": "There were two major groups of 245 under-and 175 overexpressed tags during lactation only (Table S5 , K1: 1,1,0,0 and K3: 1,1,2,2 according to the procedure of Rudolph et al., [10] to code the mean expression, see Section 2). Among 25 features the typical upregulated genes of lactation stage are the milk protein (casein alpha (Csn1s1, Csn1s2a), casein beta (Csn2), and whey acidic protein (Wap)) and biogenesis genes that mainly concern glucose and lipid metabolism (Akr1c6, Aldob, Ugt2b1, Plb1, Apoe, and Sult2b1) and transcriptional regulation (Stat5a, Pou2af1) [2] . Among those genes found significantly downregulated only during lactation, several play an important role in the regulation of apoptosis, mediation of metastatic behavior (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), or ubiquitin-mediated protein catabolism (lysosome degradation) in the mammary gland including Igfbp5, Mmp2, and Ube2r2 [14, 15] . One hundred forty-nine genes were upregulated exclusively during early pregnancy (K2: 2,1,1,1) such as Esr1, Esr2, Tshr, and Oxt. These participate in the transduction of hormonal status [2, 16] involved in the modulation of important physiological processes such as carbohydrate metabolism (Creb3l4, Hk1, and Coasy) [17] ; glutathione metabolism (Ggt1, Mgst1, and Gstm6) [18] ; cell differentiation (Foxa1, Mtap7, Gdf1, Twist2, Hey1, Dll4, and Pcaf ) [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , stromal-epithelial communication (cell-cell junctions) (Cldn10, Mpp5, and Epb4) [24] , and cell adhesion (Matn1, Krt71, Mpzl2, and Dscaml1) [25] . The smallest group of 24 genes were significantly upregulated exclusively at the onset of lactation (K4: 1,1,2,1 ) such as Lpo, Cd8a, and Irs1, important for lactogenesis, particularly in milk production capabilities and related immunotropic constituents (antigen-specific CD8+ T cells) found in colostrum [26, 27] . One hundred nineteen genes were downregulated from early pregnancy (K5: 1,1,1,0) . For example, Acta1, Flnc, and Pax7, which are either restricted to muscular tissues or involved in myogenic development and cellular differentiation [28, 29] , are included in this group. According to the trajectory profile signature, 95 additional genes were found upregulated at all stages evaluated (K6: 2,2,2,2). Interestingly, most of the overexpressed genes in this group include general transcription and translation (including spliceosome and protein folding) machinery factors (Eif4a2, Eif2ak1, Etf1, Taf1, Ercc2, Sart1, Ppih, and Dbr1) [30, 31] as well as structural (Itga5, Actg1, Add2, Cldnd2, Rptn, and Triobp) [32] and basal metabolic genes (Pank4, Agpat5, Cyp24a1, and Phyh) [33] .",

The remainder of the genes was discarded or removed from subsequent analysis due to lack of similarity, insufficient information, or unknown identifiers. A complete list of orthologous genes from each dataset was compiled (Table  S6) . Among the upregulated orthologous genes to rat and/or human are those encoding to milk proteins, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, transcriptional factors [17, 34] , transduction of hormones [16] , glutathione metabolism [18] , and cell differentiation [19, 20] .

We found distinct blocks of significantly differentially expressed genes within different cytogenetic regions of the rat with homologous chromosomal segments in human and mouse. However, human, mouse, and rat have different chromosomal arrangements. Genes in these blocks appear in contiguous cytogenetic regions, irrespective of species and chromosomal location. This finding is not surprising considering the close evolutionary distance between the species where 278 orthologous segments are reported to be shared between human and rat, and 280 segments are reported to be shared between human and mouse [4] . It is proposed that these gene blocks may be significant for mammary gland development and maintenance and progression of lactation across human, rat, and mouse. For example, genes in the blocks may be coordinately expressed to share transcription programs as stated in previous studies [37] . The argument may be made against the feasibility of using rodent data to draw inferences to human mammary gland gene expression. However, our objective in this study was to utilize the best available sources of information such as rat gene expression data during mammary development and mapping data to develop hypotheses on putative functional gene blocks conserved across species, underlying similarities despite reported differences in the architecture and hormonal control of mammary glands between rats and other rodents and between rats and humans [38, 39] .",

Several families of transcription factors were identified (Table S7 ). For the most part, zinc finger domain/motif proteins were the most widely represented. The presence of cis-elements found with CORE TF (http://www.LGTC.nl/CORE TF) in the promoters of the genes Slc44a4, Ppt2, and B3galt4 that compromises the conserved block D15 (Table S8 ) along with the cotranscription of mRNAs that encoded for trans-regulator elements suggests that they are most likely modulated by transcription factors Runx2, Creb3l4, Pou3f2, and Pou2af1. Correspondingly, the gene members of block U1 may possibly be coregulated by transcription factors Stat5a, Foxa1, Creb3l4, and Pou2af1. In the same manner, other gene blocks (U3, U8, U9, D1, D9, and D14, Table S8 ) were found most likely co-regulated by a minor number of transcription factors (Foxa1, Creb3l4, Pou2af1, or Egr2). Hence, identification of conserved overrepresented upstream motifs unravels putative regulatory elements for transcription ( Figure 6 ) in at least half of the gene block members reported in this study. Consequently, these results strongly substantiate the maintenance of comparable transcriptional regulation programs among the predicted coexpressed modules.",

Long oligonucleotide-based microarray platform may be more suitable for cross-species gene expression studies than a short oligonucleotide-based system [43] . This comparative approach is based on the assumption that similar gene sequences in closely related species allow a reasonably reliable detection of many orthologous genes. For instance, according to several independent and unrelated studies carried out on comparable 50 to 60-mer oligonucleotide microarrays, cross-hybridization was observed only with genes with 50%-75% overall sequence identity, respectively [44, 45] . Considering that orthologous genes between human and mouse and between human and rat both have a mean of \u223c85% sequence identity [46] , validity of the results obtained in this study-despite the problems encountered by CSH-in comparison to SSH seems upholding. In fact, the nucleotide sequence alignment confirmed an >75.3% homology at least for the transcript members of the distinct gene blocks described, depending on the sequence evaluated among primates and rodents reinforcing the notion of attaining valid biological results.

Nonetheless, further validation of the results must be carried out by using CSH of human RNA to mouse oligonucleotide arrays.",

This paper will hopefully spur an increase of mammary gland CSH transcriptome analysis, thus adding to our knowledge base of this interesting evolutionary feature among mammals. However, although we acknowledge the multitude of aspects that can be elucidated by traditional SSH transcriptome analysis, we believe the biggest potential of the presented microarray lies in the multispecies-type studies described. We demonstrated that data analysis strategies such as the combination of orthologous gene expression profiles and chromosome mapping in conjunction with directed promoter transcription-factor binding-site prediction presented here can add strength to conclusions and help identify systems and responses that are conserved across the mammal taxa. The possibility of studying the evolutionary depth of transcriptional regulation adds a new dimension to comparative transcriptomic, particularly identification of differentially coregulated gene blocks mapped to highly conserved syntenic chromosomal regions, which is important in mammary gland development using CSH experiments among mammal species.",

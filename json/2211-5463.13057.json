                "text": "Y-box-binding protein 1 (Ybx1, YB-1), also known as Y-box transcription factor, is involved in a variety of biological processes (BPs) and pathways, including embryogenesis, reproduction and development in vertebrates. Several noncoding RNAs regulate Ybx1 signaling. However, the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in embryogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the possible involvement of lncRNAs in Ybx1-mediated regulation of vertebrate development by performing systematic transcriptome analysis of RNA sequencing data derived from ybx1 homozygous mutant zebrafish on day 5 (day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) and wild-type zebrafish on days 5 and 6 (day5_ybx1 +/+ and day6_ybx1 +/+ ). We identified several lncRNAs affected by ybx1 disruption that may target reduction-oxidation-related genes, such as duox (NADPH oxidase) and noxo1a (NADPH oxidase organizer). Knockdown of three selected lncRNAs led to morphological deformation of larvae, implying an involvement of these lncRNAs in zebrafish embryo development. In summary, our study provides new insights into the lncRNA-mediated mechanisms underlying development in Ybx1-deficient zebrafish larvae. Y-box-binding protein 1 (Ybx1, YB-1), also known as Y-box transcription factor, is a member of a large family of proteins harboring cold shock domain, and it has been proved to have multiple functions involved in a variety of BPs and pathways, including proliferation, differentiation, regulation of apoptosis, translation, stress response, etc. This protein was found in diverse vertebrates and extensively studied in Homo sapiens because of its great clinical values. For instance, overexpression of Ybx1 was found in tumor cells and is associated with tumor phenotype [1] . In addition, Ybx1 is demonstrated to harbor the capacity of preventing oncogenic cell transformation via the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase(PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway [2] . In as much as the crucial role of Ybx1 is implicated in tumorigenesis, this protein has been regarded as a well-established biomarker and novel therapeutic target in cancer research [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

Typically, many studies showed that ybx1 knockout in mice could result in severe disorders in embryonic development and even death [7, 8] . On the one hand, Ybx1 was regarded as a crucial protein in early embryogenesis because Ybx1deficient mice were found to die at a very early stage of embryogenesis [8] . On the other hand, it was reported that ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 embryos exhibit severe growth retardation and progressive mortality after 13.5 embryonic days, which suggests its important role in latestage embryonic development in mice [7] . Moreover, maternal Ybx1 has been demonstrated to play a safeguard to protect oocyte maturation and maternal-tozygotic transition in zebrafish [9] . The similar roles of Ybx1 were found in Kumari et al.'s study [10] . It was shown that Ybx1 is an essential protein to regulate the maternal control of the Nodal signaling pathway, which has been reported to be essential to the axis formation and germ layer specification in zebrafish [10] .",

In particular, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) becomes a research hotspot in many fields because it has been demonstrated as a multifunctional regulator involved in a range of BPs and pathways and is associated with diverse diseases [11] [12] [13] . However, regarding whether lncRNA is important to vertebrate development is always debatable, particularly in embryogenesis. Goudarzi et al.'s study [14] knocked down 24 specific lncRNAs in zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9 to investigate their functions in embryo development. The result is not so satisfying because no lncRNAs are found to have overt functions in zebrafish embryogenesis, viability and fertility. Notably, a recent review by Suresh et al. [15] demonstrated that a variety of noncoding RNAs mediate Ybx1 signaling, which provides a new perspective to investigate the role of lncRNA in vertebrate development. Hence Ybx1 might be a good breakthrough to uncover the potential lncRNAs and their possible roles in embryonic development. Our study also might be regarded as complementary research providing clues to support the view that some lncRNAs are important to vertebrate development.",

The results indicate that a total of 1083 lncRNAs (~40.44%) identified in this study could be well compared with known zebrafish lncRNAs, 460 lncRNAs of which have been included in the NONCODE and ZFLNC database. The remaining mapped lncRNAs exhibit high similarity to the known zebrafish lncRNAs in some specific regions. It is not surprising because lncRNAs have been proved to be quite distinct from mRNAs as mRNAs have a more conserved mutational rate. Instead, lncRNAs have less evolutionary constraints, except the selective pressure to strictly conserve the short functional region, e.g., sequence-specific interactions, proteinbinding sites, etc. The rest of the lncRNAs that could not be found in any hit in NONCODE and ZFLNC databases might represent a group of novel zebrafish lncRNAs.",

To identify the lncRNAs associated with Ybx1 gene knockout, differential expression analysis between day5_ybx1 +/+ and day5_-ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 was conducted using DESeq2. The result shows that 44 lncRNAs (22 are up-regulated and 22 are down-regulated) and 1901 mRNAs (849 are upregulated and 1052 are down-regulated) are detected as significantly DE (Figs S1 and S2). Despite no change of the RNA expression level of Ybx1 as observed in day6_ybx1 +/+ compared with that of day5_ybx1 +/+ , we found that the protein expression level of Ybx1 was dramatically decreased in day6_-ybx1 +/+ versus day5_ybx1 +/+ (data not shown). Hence we also compared the expression level of transcripts between day5_ybx1 +/+ and day6_ybx1 +/+ to explore the underlying mechanisms resulting in decline of Ybx1 in day6_ybx1 +/+ at protein level. DE analysis showed that a total of 542 RNAs were DE in day5_-ybx1 +/+ versus day6_ybx1 +/+ , including 2 DE lncRNAs and 540 DE mRNAs (Figs S3 and S4). Then both results of DE analysis were subjected to the DAVID server to search for the possible functions of those DE RNAs. Intriguingly, both functional results indicated that the hormone synthesis-related and oxidative stress-related processes were commonly enriched with an extremely high level of statistical significance, including steroid biosynthesis process, oxidation-reduction process, etc. ( Fig. 2A,B) . This result disclosed a close association of Ybx1 with the processes of hormone synthesis and oxidative stress response in zebrafish.",

Therefore, we conducted a systematic comparison of day5_ybx1 +/+ versus day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and day5_ybx1 +/+ versus day6_ybx1 +/+ (Fig. 2C) . Concretely, 143 transcripts were found to be consistently up/down-regulated in both comparisons. Remarkably, most of them are upregulated, and only five transcripts were observed as down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis for those 143 DE transcripts showed that many BP categories involved in hormonerelated and oxidative stress-related processes were significantly enriched, such as steroid biosynthesis, oxidation-reduction process, etc. (Fig. 2D ). Furthermore, we found that 731 transcripts (including 22 lncRNAs) were specifically up-regulated in day5_ybx1 +/+ versus day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 but exhibit no changes in day5_ybx1 +/+ versus day6_ybx1 +/+ . Subsequent functional analysis on DAVID indicated that the functions of these specific up-regulated RNAs involved reproduction processes, that is, egg coat formation, binding of sperm to zona pellucida, etc. Notably, the oxidation-reduction process was also significantly enriched ( Fig. 2D) . A total of 1062 transcripts (including 22 lncRNAs) were found to be specifically down-regulated in day5_ybx1 +/ + versus day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , which involve protein transport, glycolytic process, gluconeogenesis, etc. Differential expression analysis between day5_ybx1 +/+ and day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and day6_ybx1 +/+ . GO functional enrichment analysis of DE transcripts achieved on David server: (A) day5_ybx1 +/+ versus day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and (B) day5_ybx1 +/+ versus day6_ybx1 +/+ . The results are summarized only in the category of BP. The y axis indicates functional groups. The x axis indicates -log 10 (P-value). (C) Heatmap of all DE transcripts that were clustered into five subsets, including specific down-regulated in day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , specific up-regulated in day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , specific down-regulated in day6_ybx1 +/+ , specific up-regulated in day6_ybx1 +/+ and consistently dysregulated in day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and day6_ybx1 +/+ . The expression profile was normalized using DESeq2 and then hierarchically clustered using heatmap2. Values have been centered and scaled for each row. Each row represents a single transcript. (D) Functional analysis of subsets using DAVID (FDR < 5%). ( Fig. 2D) . Similarly, we have also detected many transcripts DE in day5_ybx1 +/+ versus day6_ybx1 +/+ , but not present in day5_ybx1 +/+ versus day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 (Table 3) . Concretely, 342 transcripts (including two lncRNAs) exhibit up-regulation in day6_ybx1 +/+ , and functional analysis showed that the functions of those DE RNAs might involve the oxidation-reduction process, transmembrane transport, proteolysis, etc. (Fig. 2D ). Forty-eight specific down-regulated RNAs were found in day6_ybx1 +/+ compared with day5_-ybx1 +/+ , and their corresponding functional analysis showed that no BP categories were significantly enriched. These functional analyses based on the different subsets of DE transcripts indicated that reduced expression of ybx1 could trigger up-regulation of oxidative stress-related BPs and pathways (e.g., the oxidation-reduction process was significantly enriched by specific up-regulated transcripts in day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and day6_ybx1 +/+ ). These findings suggest that reduced expression of ybx1, either caused by Ybx1 knockout or by innate autoregulation, exhibits strong correlation with the reduction-oxidation (REDOX) regulation in zebrafish. Notably, many DE lncRNAs are included in those DE RNA datasets (the majority of them are found in the comparison of day5_ybx1 +/+ versus day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 ), implying specific lncRNAs are present in REDOX regulation after Ybx1 gene knockout.",

Initially, the flashClust tools package was used to conduct cluster analysis on these samples to detect outliers; the results showed that all samples are in the clusters and passed the cuts (Fig. S5) . Then a network-topology analysis was conducted for several soft-thresholding powers to have relative balance scale independence and mean connectivity of the WGCNA. The lowest power for the scale-free topology fit index was selected for construction of a hierarchical clustering tree (Fig. S6 ). This analysis colocalizes both correlated lncRNAs and mRNAs into 95 modules (Fig. S7) . Each module contains independent datasets of transcripts (Table 4) . The interactions among those modules were visualized in Fig. S8 . The modules with common expression patterns that were significantly associated with specific traits (day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and day6_ybx1 +/+ ) were detected based on the correlation between module eigengene and traits. Then the function plotEigengeneNetworks of WGCNA was used to identify groups of correlated eigengenes. The results indicated that two modules (yellow and black) were significantly correlated to the traits: day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and day6_ybx1 +/+ , respectively (Fig. 3) . The relationship of transcript significance with module membership was visualized in Fig. S9 . The yellow modules significantly related to day5_-ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 include 2394 mRNAs and 352 lncRNAs, whereas black modules correlated to day6_ybx1 +/+ contain 1075 mRNAs and 155 lncRNAs (Table 4) .",

Unsurprisingly, the results indicated that many REDOX processes were significantly enriched by up-regulated transcripts in two trait-related modules with considerably high significance (highlighted in red text in Fig. 4A,B ), including GO: 0006979 (response to oxidative stress), GO: 0016491 (oxidoreductase activity) and GO: 0055114 (oxidation-reduction process), etc. This finding is consistent with the results of functional enrichment analysis using DE RNAs described in the previous section ( Fig. 2D) , which further suggests that the decline of Ybx1 can enhance up-regulation of REDOX. Indeed, many studies [29] [30] [31] have illustrated the influence of oxidative stress to embryonic development in zebrafish, e.g., oxidative stress condition could change the cellular REDOX state, which further causes oxidation of molecules, such as membrane peroxidation, loss of ions, protein cleavage and DNA strand breakages, and finally leads to cell death. Next, to explore possible roles of lncRNAs in REDOX regulation triggered by decreased ybx1, we used the expression profile of DE lncRNAs and DE mRNAs included in the yellow module related to day5_ybx1 \u00c0/\u00c0 to assess the intramodular connectivity (including mRNA-mRNA and mRNA-lncRNA interactions) using TOM similarity, which was done by the function TOMsimilarityFromExpr of WGCNA package. We did not further investigate the lncRNAs implicated in REDOX in black module related to day6_ybx1 +/+ because our previous DE analysis showed that just two DE lncRNAs were found in the comparison of day5_ybx1 +/+ versus day6_ybx1 +/+ . Regarding the yellow module, we detected a great number of interactions that involved 631 DE mRNAs and 45 DE lncRNAs (Fig. 4C) . Among them, several lncRNAs, as well as mRNAs, were found to interact with two REDOX-related mRNAs, that is, duox and noxo1a (Fig. 4D) . These two genes have been demonstrated to play important roles in response to oxidative stress [32, 33] . Particularly, we observed that several lncRNAs not only exhibit strong correlations to ybx1 but can also interact with two REDOX-related mRNAs: Duox and Noxo1a (Fig. 4E ).",

However, the underlying mechanism is yet unclear. For this purpose, a large-scale screening of lncRNAprotein interactions was conducted based on the Ybx1-related, REDOX-related lncRNAs (displayed in Fig. 4E ) via the catRAPID server. We observed that the lncRNA ENSDART00000171757 exhibited moderate interactions with several regulatory proteins (Table S4) , including transcription factors, RNA-binding protein, etc. Subsequent functional analysis achieved by Metascape indicated that those proteins significantly enriched in diverse development processes (Fig. 5B) , including regionalization, endocrine system development, central nervous system development, embryonic morphogenesis, etc. In addition, through screening their possible targets via a PPI (protein-protein interaction) database STRING, we found that those proteins cooperated with Ybx1, and two key REDOX-related proteins, duox and noxo1a, might participate in a complex regulatory network involved in many developmental processes (Fig. 5A) . Notably, nifk (ranked among top 3 proteins that interacted with lncRNA ENSDART00000171757 in catRAPID) was found to interact with many ribosomal proteins and might act as a bridge to connect duox, noxo1a and ybx1 in the PPI network (Fig. 5B ). Furthermore, it has been shown to play an essential role in early zebrafish embryonic development (insertional mutagenesis in zebrafish rapidly identifies genes essential for early vertebrate development). Our analysis indicated that knockout of ybx1 in zebrafish might affect the expression of p53 and further disrupt the balance of the whole regulatory network and the expression of many key proteins involved in development, as well as lncRNA ENSDART00000171757, which might lead to overexpression of the REDOX-related genes, that is, duox. Overexpression of REDOX-related genes might further generate too much reactive oxygen and reactive Fig. 4 .

                "text": "Given that lncRNAs have been proposed to carry out diverse functions, for instance, regulation of gene expression by acting as signaling, guiding, sequestering or scaffolding molecules, an increasing number of studies focused on the disclosure of the roles of lncRNA in vertebrate development [34] [35] [36] . In some cases, however, similar works on the same lncRNAs come to contradictory conclusions. A typical example is that Lin et al.'s study [37] and Ulitsky et al.'s study [38] showed that knockdown of the lncRNA megamind led to zebrafish embryonic defects, whereas Kok et al.'s study [39] demonstrated that megamind had no influence on embryonic development. These inconsistent results have caused a dispute about whether lncRNA is important to vertebrate development. Notably, Goudarzi et al.'s study [14] used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out 24 specific lncRNAs in zebrafish, which was picked out based on synteny, conservation, expression dynamics and proximity to development-related genes and concluded that individual lncRNAs have no overt functions in zebrafish embryogenesis, viability and fertility. Given these facts, it is likely that lncRNAs exert limited functions in vertebrate development, particularly in zebrafish embryonic development. Ybx1 is an important protein to embryogenesis and development, disclosure of the correlation between ybx1 and lncRNAs transcriptome will shed new insights for unveiling organelle-based mechanisms of lncRNAs implicated in zebrafish embryo development. We believe that our study also might be regarded as complementary research to provide some clues for the issue whether the lncRNAs are important to vertebrate development. Worthy of a special mention is the fact that despite that the RNA library in this study is prepared using oligo-dT to capture sequences with poly-A tail, a great amount of lncRNAs could still be sequenced. The reason is that lncRNAs are structurally similar to mRNAs in some way, that is, the majority of mature lncRNAs are produced by the same RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery and can be polyadenylated, suggesting some of them are indistinguishable from mRNAs in structure. In this study, we reconstructed the zebrafish transcriptome and identified a high-confidence dataset of lncRNAs using a stringent filtering pipeline. Next, to figure out the lncRNAs implicated in zebrafish embryonic development, we performed a series of systematic transcriptomic analyses.These analyses concluded that decreasing ybx1 by acquired knockout or innate autoregulation exhibits close correlations to REDOX processes that involved several lncRNA regulations. Embryo development is a complicated process that underlies precise regulation and control. The roles of REDOX in embryonic development have been well elucidated so far. Concretely, oxygen can be regarded as a double-edged sword because it is essential to embryogenesis but also acts as a potential hazard via formation of ROS/RNS [40] . Too much ROS leads to oxidative stress and further causes either cell death or senescence by oxidation of cellular molecules [41]. REDOX balance is thus critical to embryonic development. Notably, ROS generated by NADPH oxidases is a crucial REDOX signal to establish homeostasis [32] . This knowledge directs us to narrow down the huge number of mRNA-lncRNA interactions to a relatively small subnetwork exhibiting strong correlation with the two key REDOX-related genes, duox and noxo1a. Among them, analysis of lncRNA-protein interactions next figured out a lncRNA (ENSDART00000171757) might interact with many proteins, which has already been demonstrated to be associated to various zebrafish embryonic development processes. For instance, nifk encodes a protein that is important to early embryonic development. The protein ang2a was found to be involved in the apoptotic process of morphogenesis, cell fate specification and midbrain development. Park7 was shown to play an important role in cell Fig. 6 . lncRNA knockdown led to larvae morphological deformation.

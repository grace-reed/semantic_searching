    "abstract": "Background: Scleractinian corals are the foundation of reef ecosystems in tropical marine environments. Their great success is due to interactions with endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.), with which they are obligately symbiotic. To develop a foundation for studying coral biology and coral symbiosis, we have constructed a set of cDNA libraries and generated and annotated ESTs from two species of corals, Acropora palmata and Montastraea faveolata. Results: We generated 14,588 (Ap) and 3,854 (Mf) high quality ESTs from five life history/symbiosis stages (spawned eggs, earlystage planula larvae, late-stage planula larvae either infected with symbionts or uninfected, and adult coral). The ESTs assembled into a set of primarily stage-specific clusters, producing 4,980 (Ap), and 1,732 (Mf) unigenes. The egg stage library, relative to the other developmental stages, was enriched in genes functioning in cell division and proliferation, transcription, signal transduction, and regulation of protein function. Fifteen unigenes were identified as candidate symbiosis-related genes as they were expressed in all libraries constructed from the symbiotic stages and were absent from all of the non symbiotic stages. These include several DNA interacting proteins, and one highly expressed unigene (containing 17 cDNAs) with no significant protein-coding region. A significant number of unigenes (25) encode potential pattern recognition receptors (lectins, scavenger receptors, and others), as well as genes that may function in signaling pathways involved in innate immune responses (toll-like signaling, NFkB p105, and MAP kinases). Comparison between the A. palmata and an A. millepora EST dataset identified ferritin as a highly expressed gene in both datasets that appears to be undergoing adaptive evolution. Five unigenes appear to be restricted to the Scleractinia, as they had no homology to any sequences in the nr databases nor to the non-scleractinian cnidarians Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata. Conclusion: Partial sequencing of 5 cDNA libraries each for A. palmata and M. faveolata has produced a rich set of candidate genes (4,980 genes from A. palmata, and 1,732 genes from M. faveolata) that we can use as a starting point for examining the life history and symbiosis of these two species, as well as to further expand the dataset of cnidarian genes for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies.",

                "text": "Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth and play important roles in ocean biogeochemical cycles. In particular, scleractinian corals are keystone species in tropical marine environments where they create the substrate and three dimensional structure of the reef ecosystem, and also provide the majority of primary productivity within the reef. Corals' reef-building capability arises from an endosymbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts (Symbiodinium spp.). The symbionts typically live enclosed within membranebound \"symbiosomes\" in host cells of the gastroderm. Corals derive photosynthate to fuel much of their metabolic requirements, while symbionts derive inorganic compounds from the host to fuel photosynthesis and symbiont growth [1] . The presence of a photosynthesizing symbiont profoundly influences rates of growth, reproduction, and CaCO deposition of scleractinian corals. While the photosynthetic nature of the symbionts restricts symbiont-bearing corals to the well-lit surface waters, it permits the partners to live in otherwise inhospitable nutrient-poor regions of the world's oceans, and sets the stage for the formation of reefs in shallow tropical water [2] .",

In particular anomalous temperature and/or high UV levels can prompt widespread coral \"bleaching\" events in which the symbiosis fails and symbionts are jettisoned from the host. To better respond to these threats, it is imperative that we better understand the initiation and regulation of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. In this manuscript we report the development of new genomic tools that will facilitate these discoveries in two Caribbean coral species, Acropora palmata and Montastraea faveolata.",

Instead, most corals produce offspring that lack symbionts, and these offspring are faced with the task of acquiring symbionts from the environment. Newly settled hard corals and gorgonians can acquire zooxanthellae within a week when maintained on the reef as well as when cultured in the laboratory [6] . In most cases so far examined, symbiotic cnidarians take up symbionts by phagocytosis, during which symbionts that enter the host's gastric cavity are internalized by phagocytic cells of the gastroderm [7] [8] [9] [10] . Occasionally, Symbiodinium has also been observed in the ectoderm of larvae [9] , and in some coral species, Symbdiodinium infects the new host during embryonic development, before gastrulation [11] .",

Relative to other metazoans, cnidarians are characterized by embryonic development of only two tissue layers (endoderm and ectoderm), a lack of complex organ systems, and the development of fewer than a dozen cell types. EST/genomic sequencing projects for the hydrozoan Hydra magnipapillata, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, and the Indo-Pacific scleractinian coral Acropora millepora have revealed that cnidarians possess homologs for many developmental genes that control axial specification of the bilaterian body plan [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . The recent publication of the whole genome of N. vectensis has revealed that a large portion of the gene repertoire is shared between cnidarians and vertebrates whereas substantial gene loss has occurred in the ecdysozoan model organisms (i.e. Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabdites elegans) [12, 16] . Given the genetic complexity of cnidarians, a comparative analysis of scleractinian and bilaterian genomes would greatly enhance our understanding of a diverse array of metazoan biological processes, for example symbiosis [17] , and calcification and biomineralization [18] [19] [20] .",

A large scale analysis is necessary as there are several biological processes that are likely to be invoked to establish a stable partnership. Mechanisms of host-symbiont recognition likely involve interactions between molecules present on the surface of both the symbiont and host cells, for example carbohydratelectin interactions, as were recently described for the coral Fungia scutaria [21] . Concomitant with the phagocytic uptake of symbionts, the host will likely exhibit some flavor of innate immune response, and that response will likely be manipulated by the symbiont such that it remains viable within the host cell [22] . There is evidence that one mechanism by which Symbiodinium manipulates host response is by interfering with maturation of the phagosome [23] [24] [25] Second, upon entry, it is likely that the underlying structural organization of the host cell/gastrodermal tissue must be modified significantly, as the symbiont occupies most of the volume of the host cell. This would likely include alterations in lipids and protein components of the cell, features that were implicated in the mature symbiosis in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima [17, 26] Third, the presence of Symbiodinium is correlated with rapid calcification of the coral skeleton, and therefore processes related to skeletonization (Puverel et al. 2007 ) are likely to be induced or upregulated during the onset of symbiosis.",

The evidence for this is that the Acropora EST dataset generated only 5 unigenes that were expressed in all 5 life history stages, and the Montastraea dataset produced none. In fact, the vast majority of unigene EST clusters are comprised of ESTs from a single developmental stage. This may reflect the conservative parameters of our clustering methods (to be clustered, reads must possess 96% identity across 100 or more nucleotides), but also is likely a consequence of sampling bias resulting from small sample size (small numbers of clones sequenced from each library). Only the spawned egg stage shows significant dif-ferences in the GO content in comparison to the overall EST collection. The egg is poised to initiate development of the zygote, thus it is expected to express at high levels genes involved in the first stages of cleavage and development, for example genes involved in cell proliferation, mitosis, regulation of transcription, and signal transduction. All of these categories were identified by Gene Merge as being over-represented in the egg stage.",

A small handful of players have been identified as playing roles in cnidarian-microbial interactions [21, 38, 39] . What is particularly interesting about studying innate immune response in corals is that a mutualistic infection of animals by eukaryotic microbes is known to occur only in a few marine invertebrate species, with corals being the poster child for this animal-microbe interaction. The ability to experimentally infect corals with their symbionts provides a study system both for characterizing the host response to microbial infection in basal metazoans, and for comparative studies of mutualistic vs. pathogenic infection in animals.",

As a result, it is extremely useful as a starting point to identify components of the innate immune and host response systems that have been identified from pathogenic or parasitic associations. The coraldinoflagellate symbiosis adds a new dimension to understanding host-microbial associations, as the coral microbial partner is a eukaryote (related to the apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium and Toxoplasma), rather than a prokaryote. To identify candidate genes that may function in the host-microbe interaction processes, we examined our EST datasets to identify 1) protein domains (search against Pfam database of protein domains) and genes (blastx against nr and Swissprot) that are known to play roles in 1) cell-cell or pattern recognition interactions, and 2) signaling pathways that are known to be involved in host response to microbial infection.",

Alignment gaps and ambiguity characters are removed in PAML prior to dN/dS calculations. Data analyses and computer simulations have showed that these pairs of site models are well suited to detect positively selected sites [56, [59] [60] [61] . A likelihood-ratio test (LRT) was used to compare the neutral with the corresponding selection models. The test statistic -2\u0394lnL follows a \u03c7 2 distribution with critical values to be 5.99 and 9.21 at 5% and 1% (df = 2). When the LRT is significant a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) procedure was used to identify amino acid under positive selection. Overall dN/dS values ('one-ratio' model) were calculated with the Model M0. The F3x4 model of codon frequencies was used.",

Most ASIC subunits form trimeric ion channels that upon activation by extracellular protons mediate a transient inward current inducing cellular excitability. ASIC subunits exhibit differential tissue expression and biophysical properties, and the ability of subunits to form homo-and heteromeric trimers further increases the complexity of currents measured and their pharmacological properties. ASIC3 is of particular interest, not only because it exhibits high expression in sensory neurones, but also because upon activation it does not fully inactivate: a transient current is followed by a sustained current that persists during a period of extracellular acidity, i.e. ASIC3 can encode prolonged acidosis as a nociceptive signal. Furthermore, certain mediators sensitize ASIC3 enabling smaller proton concentrations to activate it and other mediators can directly activate the channel at neutral pH. Moreover, there is a plethora of evidence using transgenic mouse models and pharmacology, which supports ASIC3 as being a potential target for development of analgesics.

                "text": "The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)/Degenerin (DEG) ion channel superfamily are selective for Na + , showing preference over K + of 100-fold for ENaC and 10-fold for ASIC subunits [3] [4] [5] . An additional characteristic of the ENaC/DEG superfamily is sensitivity to the reversible channel blocker, amiloride [6] . In mammals, there are nine ENaC/DEG genes, four encode ENaC subunits (\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3/\u03b4-ENaC) and five encode ASIC subunits (ASIC1-5). Although the nomenclature has been standardized for the ASIC family (Table 1) , ASIC5 is still often referred to as Bile Acid-Sensitive Ion Channel (BASIC), due to it not being modulated by extracellular acid [7] and displaying a low amino acid homogeneity of ~30% with other ASIC subunits (by contrast, ASIC1-4 share at least 50% amino homogeneity, Table 2 ) [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Due to alternative splicing, the four main ASIC genes produce six ASIC subunits: ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3 and ASIC4 and studies using x-ray crystallography [12] and atomic force microscopy [13] have demonstrated that ASICs form trimers, subunits combining to form homomeric or heteromeric ion channels. To date, a total of 18 ASIC structures are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), but all of these are of Gallus gallus (chicken) ASIC1a (cASIC1a). Therefore, it should be remembered that all structural information discussed on ASIC3 (Figure 1 ), both here and in the wider literature, is largely based on the structure of cASIC1a. Like BASIC, not all ASIC subunits form proton-sensitive homotrimers, ASIC2b and ASIC4 both being proton-insensitive [14, 15] , but able to modulate the properties of other ASICs in heteromeric configurations [16, 17] . Of all ASIC subunit configurations, those containing ASIC3 are the most sensitive to protons [18] , as well as producing a characteristic biphasic response: an initial transient inward current followed by a smaller magnitudesustained phase, features that make ASIC3 of particular interest in the context of pain [5] . Human ASIC3 (hASIC3) was first located on chromosome 7q35 (6.4 cRad telomeric) in the late 1990s [19] and there have been limited subsequent studies of hASIC3, and thus, this review will encompass the broader mammalian publications from rat (rASIC3) and mouse (mASIC3) orthologues which share an 84% amino acid identity to hASIC3.",

                "text": "Early work by Krishtal et al., in 1980 , demonstrated for the first time that application of extracellular acid could evoke inward currents in sensory neurones [20] , and further work has shown that localized tissue acidification (pH \u22646.0) causes pain in humans [21--21-23] . Thus, there is a clear link between acidosis, acid-evoked sensory neurone activation and pain. There are a variety of ion channels and receptors that can be modulated by acid, which have been reviewed in detail elsewhere [24] , but here we will concentrate on ASICs, which underlie the transient inward currents first recorded 40 years ago. With the exception of ASIC4 and ASIC5, all ASIC subunits show robust expression in sensory neurones [25, 26] and their activation by extracellular acid causes transient proton-gated currents that are mainly carried by Na + , although ASIC1a homomers also show Ca 2+ permeability [27] . The ASIC-mediated cation influx leads to neuronal depolarization, which, if of sufficient magnitude to activate voltage-gated sodium channels, can induce action potential firing in nociceptors Table 1 . ASIC Family Nomenclature. Identification of further ASIC subunits has led to the evolution of their nomenclature, finally resulting in the transition to the use of alpha numerical names. NaC -Sodium Chanel, ACCN -Amiloride-Sensitive Cation Channel, BNaC -Brain NaC, BASIC -Bile ASIC, (BL) INAC -(Brain, Liver and) Intestine NaC, DRASIC -Dorsal Root ASIC, MDEG -Mammalian and Degenerin Channel, SPASIC -Spinal Cord ASIC, and TNaC -Testis NaC. (sensory neurones tuned to detect noxious stimuli [28] ) and ultimately evoke the sensation of pain. Whilst ASICs are gated by extracellular protons, their proton sensitivity can be modulated by other extracellular ions such as Ca 2+ and Zn 2+ (discussed in later sections). As illustrated in Figure 2 , homomeric ASIC3 and some ASIC3 containing heteromers (especially ASIC2a/3) display a pronounced sustained current in the continued presence of acidity following partial inactivation of the initial transient inward current. This sustained current implies that in the presence of prolonged tissue acidosis, ASIC3 would remain activated, supporting a sustained inward Na + current in sensory neurones causing their membrane depolarization and ultimately prolonged action potential firing. Thus, ASIC3 can effectively transduce the prolonged tissue acidosis occurring in pathological conditions into pain. Following initial work demonstrating that ASICs are activated by extracellular protons, much research has been dedicated to identifying the region and amino acids that detect protons [27] . In the very first crystal structure of cASIC1a, an acidic pocket situated between the finger-thumb-ball region, was proposed to be critical for proton sensing [12] . However, mutagenesis of residues within this acidic pocket did not fully abolish proton sensitivity for ASIC1a [29, 30] . Additionally, rASIC2a is proton-sensitive, whereas its splice variant rASIC2b is not, yet both subunits contain the same 5/6 carboxylate residues of the acidic pocket; site-directed mutagenesis and chimera construction of rASIC2a/2b have identified that the first 87 amino acids after transmembrane domain 1 are of particular importance [16, 31] . Furthermore, mutational analysis of the rASIC1a palm domain has identified it to also be an influential component to proton activation, but of less importance than the finger-thumb-ball acidic pocket region [32, 33] .",

Mouse ASIC3 (mASIC3) shows similar protonsensitivity to rASIC3, but naked mole-rat ASIC3 (nmrASIC3), despite sharing >80% amino acid identity with mASIC3 and rASIC3, respectively, is not activated by extracellular protons. Much like protoninsensitive ASIC2b and ASIC4, nmrASIC3 is able to traffic to the cell membrane and modulate the properties of proton-sensitive ASIC subunits [35] . There is an 84% amino acid identity between hASIC3 and rASIC3, the 16% difference accounting for some differences in channel activity, such as hASIC3 requiring only pH 6.0 for sustained current activation, whereas rASIC3 requires a more acidic pH 4.5 [19] . Interestingly, hASIC3, but not rASIC3, has 3 splice variants resulting in differences in the C-terminal domain and one of these, hASIC3a, is activated (albeit to a lesser extent) by alkalinization [36] . Thus, contrary to the function implied by the name acid-sensing ion channel, it appears that activation is according to a change in pH, rather than acid-sensing per se. Residues Arg68 and Arg83 located within the base of the palm region of hASIC3a have been implicated in sensing alkalinization, such that if they are mutated the sustained current in high pH is significantly reduced; these residues are absent in rASIC3 which aligns with the fact that rASIC3 is activated only by pH<7.0 [36] .",

Besides metabolic disorders producing systemic pH changes, there are other conditions that result in local pH changes ( Figure 3 ). For example, inflammation occurs in response to pathogens, trauma, or autoimmune diseases. As immune cells infiltrate the site of injury there is often a concomitant drop in pH, in arthritic conditions, for example, although reported pH values differ, human synovial fluid readings place this acidification for rheumatoid (RA) at \u2206 (the difference in pH compared to healthy individuals of) 0.7 pH units [38] and osteoarthritis (OA) at \u2206 0.55 pH units [39] . Gout is a further form of inflammatory arthritis and is linked to uric acid levels. As the joint pH becomes more acidic, urate crystals become insoluble leading to deposition into the joints and researchers examining the urine pH levels of those with gout compared to healthy individuals identified a significant difference (\u2206 2.6 units) [40] , but a localized pH drop of 0.24 units represents a more reflective change at the disease site [41] . However, it should be noted that not all studies of gout, OA and RA record acidosis, i.e. it has also been reported that synovial fluid from patients with gout, OA and RA can be approximately pH 7.4 [42] .",

In a study involving (mice and naked mole-rats), ASIC3 appears to be most abundantly expressed in the PNS (dorsal root ganglion, DRG) and represents the predominant ASIC isoform (approximately 10-fold higher expression than ASIC1-4) whilst its expression levels in the CNS (spinal cord and various brain regions) are comparable to or lower than other ASIC subunits [49] . This is in contrast with the early observation showing rASIC3 expression being confined to the PNS [27] . However, several studies now support ASIC3 CNS expression, including in the superior cervical ganglia, spinal cord, brain stem [50] and hypothalamus [51] , and recent single-cell RNAsequencing of various mouse brain regions shows that ASIC3 is expressed in numerous brain regions, albeit higher expression being observed in sensory neurones [25] . Both the hypothalamus and hippocampus play a role in emotional behavior [52, 53] , and ASIC3 \u2212/mice showed reduced aggression and anxiety-like behavior compared to wild-type (WT) Table 3 .

Thus, the relative contribution of ASIC3 in humans compared to rodents with respect to CNS expression might be different. One difference of potential clinical significance is the elevated expression of hASIC3 in GABAergic interneurons of the temporal lobe identified in epileptic patients [55] . This is because inhibition of ASIC3 with the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima toxin 2 (APETx2), in rat models of epilepsy leads to: shortened latency to seizure, increased incidence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and significantly decreased frequency of action potential firing in interneurons; thus, ASIC3 may play a protective role through dampening action of potential frequency in post-synaptic neurones [55] .",

The group went further to show that ASIC3 expression is increased 24 hours after plantar incision, with inhibition of ASIC3 significantly reducing spontaneous, thermal, and postural pain behaviors [59] . The role of ASIC3 in pain in general is further supported by ASIC3 \u2212/mice displaying a reduced latency to the onset of moderate to high-intensity pain stimuli, in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, hot-plate test and in mechanically induced pain [60] . Moreover, injection of acetic acid (pH ~3.5-4.0) or SL-NH2 (a peptide that causes itch) alone to both ASIC3 \u2212/and WT mice produced no difference in response between genotypes, but a combination of acid and SL-NH2 caused a statistically significant increase in scratching in WT mice compared to ASIC3 \u2212/-, which was ablated by administration of amiloride; subsequent analysis found that SL-NH2 slows the rate of pH 5.0-induced ASIC3 desensitization which may contribute to itch behavior [61] .

Under control conditions, it has been shown that mice express ASIC3 in knee joint synoviocytes, but not in primary afferent neurones innervating the knee joint synovium, whereas post-inflammation (induced by carrageenan), ASIC3 coexpression was observed with protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 and calcitonin generelated peptide (CGRP) in synovium-innervating primary afferent fibers; furthermore, unlike WT mice, ASIC3 \u2212/mice do not develop secondary mechanical analgesia (in response to von-Frey filaments), but like WT mice do develop primary mechanical hyperalgesia (in response to response to tweezers) [67] . It should be noted that a further study using retrograde tracing has found that ~30% of knee-innervating afferents express ASIC3 under control conditions, which rises to ~50% during inflammation [68] , thus afferents innervating non-synovium regions (e.g. bone, menisci, ligaments, etc.) of the knee likely express ASIC3 under control conditions with synoviuminnervating neurones also expressing ASIC3 during inflammation. Considering the expression of ASIC3 in both synoviocytes and sensory neurones, development of synovial fluid acidity has the potential to modulate multiple cell types in an ASIC3-dependent manner. Indeed, in fibroblastlike synoviocyte (FLS) cultures isolated from WT mice, exposure to pH 5.5 for 1 hour increased hyaluronan release, by 1.5-fold compared to (physiological) pH 7.4, via increased intracellular calcium [Ca 2+ ] i [69] . This could be a potential protective mechanism to compensate for the enhanced ASIC3 expression observed in these cells during inflammation. In addition to ASIC3 expressing FLS cells mediating increased [Ca 2+ ] i in response to acidic pH, the addition of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) caused an ASIC3-dependent increase in the levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), IL-6 and matrix metalloproteinase mRNA, and ultimately FLS cell death, a cascade that was significantly muted in ASIC3 \u2212/mice [70] . This observation of IL-1\u03b2 modulating ASIC3 function is further confirmed in studies in mice showing that induction of ischemia-related myalgia caused an increase in mechanical hypersensitivity and defensive behaviors, which were both attenuated by knock-down of ASIC3 or the IL-1 receptor 1 [71] .",

Carrageenan and CFA intra-plantar paw injections have been shown to produce similar degrees of inflammation in WT and ASIC3 \u2212/mice, however, the inflammation does not directly correlate to the degree of hyperalgesia. Whereas both inflammation models produced a statistically significant difference for mechanical hyperalgesia between genotypes (after 24 hours, i.e. ASIC3 \u2212/mice showed less hyperalgesia compared to WT), only carrageenan produced a statistically significant thermal hyperalgesia difference (after 24 hours, i.e. ASIC3 \u2212/mice showed less hyperalgesia compared to WT); furthermore, the ASIC3 \u2212/displayed a reduction in the inflammatory features (granuloma and vasculitis) of muscle compared to WT by ~65% [77] , which may perpetuate differences in hyperalgesia between genotypes. In support of these findings, carrageenan-induced muscle inflammation in WT mice is associated with an increase in ASIC3 mRNA in lumbar DRG neurones, and in the same model, ASIC3 \u2212/mice develop only primary, but not secondary, muscle hyperalgesia [78] . In a different model of muscle pain, repeated acid injections into the gastrocnemius muscle caused mechanical hyperalgesia in WT mice, but not ASIC3 \u2212/mice, furthermore, ASIC3 \u2212/mice did not develop cutaneous mechanical hyperalgesia after muscle inflammation whilst heat hyperalgesia occurred at similar levels to in WT mice [79] . Interestingly, the importance of ASIC3 in muscle mechanical hyperalgesia was reinforced by results showing that injecting an ASIC3-encoding virus (and administration of carrageenan) into the muscle of ASIC3 \u2212/mice resulted in rescuing of the development of muscle mechanical hyperalgesia like that observed in WT mice, thus demonstrating a key role for ASIC3 in muscle-innervating sensory neurones in this model [80] . Mechanical hyperalgesia is also a prominent consequence of nerve injury. It has been shown that whilst ASIC3 \u2212/mice showed greater sensitivity to mechanical stimulation compared to WT, in post-spinal nerve ligation of ASIC3 \u2212/mice showed comparable development of mechanical and heat hyperalgesia to WT mice; thus, ASIC3 appears to play a limited role in neuropathic pain [81] . The role of ASIC3 in neuropathic pain has been further evaluated using the cisplatin model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, which causes hyperalgesia and allodynia in rodents [82] , increased expression of ASIC3 being observed in DRG neurones innervating the gastrocnemius muscle, alongside mechanical hyperalgesia, which was ameliorated by the ASIC inhibitor amiloride [83] .",

A theory explaining the pathophysiology in the intervertebral discs that links to the pain experienced is that of increased lactate production (due to anaerobic glycolysis in the muscle) which leads to reduced pH and ultimately neuronal death [88] . Within the inner core of the invertebrate disc is the nucleus pulposus, which sits in a mildly acidic (pH 6.8-7.2) [89] , hyperosmotic and avascular environment, and under these conditions ASIC3 (expressed by nucleus pulposus cells) serves to promote cell survival and lower the activity of the pro-apoptotic protein, caspase-3; ASIC3 was shown to be positively regulated by NGF via p75NTR and ERK signaling [90] , a pathway implicated in neuronal diseases and when inhibited, suppresses neuropathic pain [91] . During degeneration of the rat nucleus pulposus tissue, ASIC3 expression is decreased and there is an elevated level of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), which has been proposed to downregulate ASIC3 through the SMAD3 pathway [92] . This protective function of ASIC3 in intervertebral disc degeneration is further supported by the observation that culturing human nucleus pulposus cells under acidic conditions leads to increased apoptosis, which can be prevented through the use of amiloride [93, 94] .",

One reason could be that there is a higher expression of ASIC3 in muscle than cutaneous afferents, as has been reported in rats, for example, 83% of ASIC3-expressing muscle afferents also expressed the vasodilatory peptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) leading to the hypothesis that these afferents may act as muscle metaboreceptors, triggering pain during insufficient oxygen supply to the muscle, such as might occur during exercise [95] . This hypothesis is supported by femoral occlusion induced by arterial ligation of rat hindlimb muscles (i.e. vascular insufficiency) leading to a significant increase in ASIC3 expression in the surrounding muscle-innervating sensory neurones, suggesting that ASIC3 might contribute to the exaggerated sympathetic and pressor responses observed during arterial occlusion due to lactic acid build up [96] .",

Studies by Sutherland and colleagues [34] demonstrated that sensory neurones innervating the heart were excited by acid and produced currents with similar biophysical properties to those of rASIC3 [34] . Whilst 90% of rat cardiac-innervating DRG neurones had ASIC-like currents, only 50% of cardiac DRG neurones do in mice, but nevertheless, cardiac innervating neurones isolated from ASIC3 \u2212/mice exhibited a more acidic halfmaximal pH of activation compared to WT mice [97] . In rat sensory neurones, ASIC-like currents are sensitized by lactate (a by-product of anaerobic metabolism during cardiac ischemia) due to it chelating Ca 2+ and the same effect is observed with rASIC3 [98] . Lactate shifts the activation curve of ASIC3-like currents in rat cardiacinnervating sensory neurones, such that they display prolonged sustained currents at more basic pH in the presence of lactate [99] . In addition to lactate, it appears that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is likely involved in sensitizing of ASIC3, activation of P2X5 by ATP resulting in ASIC3 producing larger responses to acid than acid alone [100] . Furthermore, it has been shown that a combination of acid, lactate and ATP is more effective than each individual substance alone at activating muscle-innervating sensory neurones [101] . Thus, it appears that ASIC3 acts as a coincident detector of lactate, ATP and protons to mediate cardiac and skeletal muscle pain.",

ASIC3 is the highest expressed ASIC isoform in carotid body glomus cells, and is considered to be a key mediator of the carotid body response to extracellular acidosis [102] , which can result during hypercapnia. Moreover, spontaneously hypertensive rats display enhanced chemoreceptor sensitivity alongside increased ASIC3 expression in carotid bodies, thus further indicating a key role for ASIC3 in carotid body function [103] . Moreover, there is evidence that ASIC3 is also involved in control of blood pressure, as well as regulating breathing rate. For example, ASIC3 \u2212/mice have a lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, coupled with a slightly, but not statistically significant, higher heart rate, as a potential compensatory role, compared to WT mice [104] . The link between ASIC3 and blood pressure regulation is further supported by the human genetic polymorphism rs2288646-A found in Taiwanese individuals, which is associated with a higher frequency of higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, allele frequency being 9.7% amongst those with hypertension [105] ; however, the effect of this polymorphism on channel function or expression is yet to be determined.",

In support of this hypothesis, the hyperresponsiveness observed in mice following induction of increased intragastric acidity was greatly diminished in ASIC3 \u2212/mice, the sensory importance of ASIC3 being demonstrated by reduced brainstem activity (measured with c-Fos, a marker of neuronal excitation), and thus ASIC3 can be considered a detector of noxious gastric acid secretion [116] .

More recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing of colonic sensory afferent neurones has identified ASIC3 to be expressed in 3/7 colonic sensory neurone subsets, thus suggesting that it has a distinct role to play in colonic sensory function [26] . Using transgenic mice to investigate a possible role for ASIC3 in gastrointestinal function and the chronic abdominal pain experienced by patients, ASIC3 \u2212/mice were observed to have a reduction in distention sensitivity of 50%, which would correlate with a reduction in pain [119] . Moreover, zymosan-induced colonic hypersensitivity is blunted in ASIC3 \u2212/mice [120] .",

A characteristic of asthma is reversible bronchoconstriction leading to a difficulty in breathing and coughing, symptoms which can be induced using citric acid in guinea pigs [126] . In the advanced stages of COPD, there is high prevalence (>75%) of pain, breathlessness and fatigue [127] , which can be attributed to the characteristic hypoxia associated with the condition. In rats, three days after chronic hypoxia, the petrosal ganglion has been shown to express elevated levels of ASIC3 (no change in superior cervical or sensory nodose ganglion expression); additionally, chronic hypoxia induces an inflammatory cytokine response (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) which can also increase ASIC3 expression [128] . Interestingly, the cytokineinduced increase in ASIC3 was prevented by concomitant ibuprofen administration and although ibuprofen inhibits ASIC1a, it has no effect upon ASIC3 [129] , thus the effect of ibuprofen is most likely due to its disruption of cyclooxygenase mediated signaling pathways.",

Further down the excretory route, rat bladderinnervating DRG neurones also display ASIC3-like currents [133] and it is thought that these ASIC3expressing neurones likely play a role in bladder function because bladder afferents in ASIC3 \u2212/mice no longer respond to extracellular acidification [134] . Moreover, a common form of bladder irritation is cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis and in rats this is accompanied by increased ASIC3 expression in the urothelium and suburothelia plexus, but not in the detrusor smooth muscle, thus further suggesting a role for ASIC3 in bladder function [135] . By contrast, in humans, bladder biopsies show ASIC3 to be expressed in both detrusor smooth muscle and urothelium, increased levels occurring in those presenting with bladder pain [136] . Lastly, painful urination (dysuria) is a common symptom of urinary tract infections (UTIs), where bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, increase urine pH to make it less acidic. Thus, depending upon the causative bacterium, urinary pH has been reported to rise from a more acidic range of pH 5-7.5 [137] , toward the basic range of \u22656.72 in children [138] and \u22656.28 in adults [139] . Considering that hASIC3a is activated by both acidification and alkalinization, and the expression of ASIC3 in bladder afferents, it could well be that hASIC3a plays a role in UTI pain, but this remains to be tested.",

For example, in mice ASIC3 is expressed in cochlear spiral ganglion neurones and the organ of Corti [140, 141] , as well as in the vestibular afferent neurones of rat [142] . With regard to the function of ASIC3 in hearing, ASIC3 \u2212/mice have normal hearing at birth, but go on to develop hearing loss (4 months post birth); however, the mechanism for this early-onset hearing loss and any potential role of ASIC3 is not fully understood [141] . Functioning auditory capability of mothers is essential for them to respond to vocalization of their pups. The auditory frequency of mice is reduced from 2 to 90 kHz measured in WT mice, to 4-32 kHz in ASIC3 \u2212/-, which was coupled with a reduction in maternal care and pup social development (e.g. reduction in anogenital sniffing, whisker to whisker and push under interactions), phenotypes that were accompanied by reduced serotonergic transmission in the hippocampus, striatum, midbrain and brainstem [143] . Lastly, ASICs may also contribute to the ototoxic action of aminoglycosides, such as neomycin and streptomycin. This is because aminoglycosides reduce the desensitization rate of the ASIC-like currents in mouse spiral ganglion neurones, i.e. Na + influx is maintained for a longer period, and a known side-effect of these drugs is ototoxicity associated with persistent Na + entry [140] .",

In addition, ASIC3 is expressed by sensory neurones innervating the eye where it may act to detect pH changes, such as the acidification observed in rabbit glaucoma models, where consistent high intraocular pressure (>70 mmHg) leads to a drop in pH (7.32 to 7.03) [146] .",

Within odontoblast soma (cells situated on the outer surface of the dental pulp), hASIC3 is expressed at low levels [147] ; nevertheless, it may play a role in the transmission of tooth pain [148] . This is because rASIC3 has been observed in 33% of sensory neurones innervating tooth pulp, thus indicating a potential role in dental pain [149] . Similarly, in mice, ASIC3 is expressed in trigeminal ganglion neurones and the periodontal Ruffini, a primary mechanoreceptor, endings [150] . In humans, a case study of two patients showed that they were responsive to bitter, sweet, and salty, but not sour stimuli, an observation that was coupled with ASIC3 being one of a few receptors undetectable in the lingual fungiform papillae of the sour-ageusia patients (others included polycystic kidney disease channels and ASIC1a/1b/2a/ 2b) [151] . Considering that acid evokes amiloridesensitive currents in rat vallate taste receptors [152] , it can certainly be hypothesized that ASIC3 (perhaps in tandem with other ASICs) is involved in sour taste and thus lack of expression in individuals with sour-ageusia may explain their phenotype.",

This adaptation to changes in pH in bone in humans has been linked to ASIC3, with expression established in osteoclasts albeit at relatively low levels in comparison to ASIC1 and ASIC2 [154] .

With age, glucose tolerance declines and insulin resistance increases (contributing toward a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the elderly population) and interestingly ASIC3 \u2212/mice, as well as wild-type mice administered ASIC3 inhibitors displayed improved glucose intolerance with enhanced insulin sensitivity [160] . In either case, the exact mechanism by which ASIC3 (and the rs2288646A polymorphism) is involved in blood glucose regulation is unknown. Long-term diabetes is associated with diabetic neuropathy, which affects 40-50% of diabetics in their lifetime [161, 162] .

As reported in studies examining the effect of lactate upon ASIC3, which increases ASIC3 currents by chelating Ca 2 + , reducing extracellular Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ concentrations directly increase ASIC3-mediated currents [98, 99] . Lactate, which is also released in ischemia, (at pH 7.0, 15 mM in vitro) increased the transient amplitudes of rASIC3 by 70%, this amplitude effect was replicated in the absence of lactate with dual reductions of extracellular Ca 2+ (\u0394 0.29 mM) and Mg 2+ (\u0394 0.12 mM) concentrations [98] . Given the lactate amplitude effects were negated by increasing Ca 2+ (\u0394 0.35 mM) and Mg 2+ (\u0394 0.12 mM) concentrations, it is likely that lactate's mechanism of action is through chelating divalent cations.",

However, it has also been shown that COX-independent mechanisms exist that contribute to the analgesic effect of NSAIDs [170] . The Lazdunski lab observed that inflammation of rat hindpaws significantly upregulated the mRNA levels of some ASIC subunits (ASIC1a, ASIC2b, and ASIC3) in rat DRG neurones and that this could largely be suppressed by corticosteroids, as well as by some NSAIDS [129] . They further investigated if there were any direct effects of NSAIDs on ASIC subunits when expressed in CHO cells and observed that certain NSAIDs, at high micromolar concentrations, could inhibit ASIC currents in a somewhat isoform-selective manner. Interestingly, salicylic acid (IC 50 of 260 \u00b1 21 \u03bcM, Figure 5a ), aspirin (IC 50 not specified, Figure 5b) , and diclofenac (IC 50 of 92 \u00b1 19 \u03bcM, Figure 5c ) inhibited the sustained current component of ASIC3 but not the transient component, whereas the ASIC1a current was inhibited by ibuprofen (IC 50 not specified) and flurbiprofen (IC 50 of 349 \u00b1 40 \u03bcM) only. A range of other NSAIDs, namely piroxicam, etodolac, nimesulide, naproxen indomethacin and acetaminophen had no effect on either ASIC1a or ASIC3. However, subsequent work from Pless lab established that ibuprofen and some of its analogues could inhibit the transient currents of ASIC3 albeit with very weak potency, i.e. ibuprofen had an IC 50 of 51.3 mM (Figure 5d ) at pH 6.4 [171] . Using site-directed mutagenesis, they identified a region comprising the upper of transmembrane helices and extracellular domain \u03b29-\u03b14 loop of rASIC1a to be the main site of ibuprofen binding. Most of the key residues identified for ibuprofen recognition are largely conserved across rASIC1a, rASIC1b, and rASIC2a, but rASIC3 has different residues in two key positions namely Thr in place of Lys76 (K76T) and has Ala in place of a critical Lys (K422A). It is intriguing to note that despite these amino acid differences, ibuprofen's potency for inhibiting the ASIC3 peak current was comparable to that for inhibiting ASIC1a (IC 50 of 29.5 mM), which suggests that other binding regions are likely involved.",

Whilst temperature does not directly stimulate nor inhibit mASIC3 activity, reducing the temperature from 34\u00b0C to 6\u00b0C slowed the rate of (pH 4-induced) desensitization [177] . A similar effect was observed in rat DRG neurones where increasing the temperature (from 22\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C) accelerated the rate of desensitization [178] ; given that the pH used was pH 6.8 and that a biphasic current observed, this effect is most likely attributable to rASIC3. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the half-maximal activation pH becomes more acidic (pH 6.73 to 6.66) as temperature was increases (25\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C) [179] .",

Clinically, amiloride is prescribed as an antihypertensive medication with classification as a K + sparing diuretic due to its effects upon ENaC in the nephron [180] , thus, amiloride has limited potential as an analgesic due to diuresis being an unwanted side effect. A further disadvantage is that amiloride can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and hence there is also potential for side effects resulting from central inhibition of centrally expressed ASICs. Lastly, the lack of selectivity across ASIC isoforms at comparable concentrations to those that inhibit other ion channels and transporters limits the potential of amiloride directly being used to target ASICs to relieve pain [181] [182] [183] .",

These sites are conserved between ASIC1a and ASIC3 and are likely to represent the binding sites for amiloride on ASIC3 too. Interestingly, attenuation of ASIC3 currents was observed with a high amiloride concentration (200 \u03bcM) at highly acidic pH (pH 4) [5] , but the same concentration paradoxically enhanced currents at neutral pH (pH 7) [99] . The structural basis of such enhancement of ASIC3 current by amiloride remains unclear but Xu and Colleges have suggested, using site-directed mutagenesis, that the observed effect was dependent on the integrity of the nonproton ligand-sensing domain in ASIC3 [185] .",

The same group continued to explore the SAR around A-317,567 and linked the 2-napththimidamide and tetrahydroisoquinoline moieties and produced several derivatives. The compound with an acetylenic linkage (\"compound 10b\", Figure 6d ) was also highly potent (IC 50 = 356 nM) ASIC3 channel blocker, which was also found to reverse mechanical hypersensitivity in the rat iodoacetate model of OA, although sedation was noted [189] . Sedation was also observed in ASIC3 \u2212/mice, suggesting that sedation (and thus possibly also analgesia) are mediated independent of ASIC3 inhibition [189] . To identify novel chemical scaffolds against ASIC3, Merck also carried out a highthroughput electrophysiological screening of their proprietary fragment library. From the initial hits, subsequent optimization led to significant improvement of potency (0.7 mM to 3 \u03bcM) with retention of good ligand efficiency and incorporation of reasonable physicochemical properties, off-target profile, and pharmacokinetics in rats [190] . The best lead compound ('compound 24', Figure 6e ) from this fragment-based approach had an IC 50 of 3.1 \u03bcM when measured in vitro, but to date there has been no evaluation of this or other compounds from this (late 2010) report against pain in in vivo models.",

Although APETx2 has been used in various animal studies, e.g. subcutaneous administration reduced acid-evoked paw flinching [58] and intraarticular administration ameliorated OA pain [73] , being a 42 amino acid peptide makes it inappropriate for systemic use due to it being prone to rapid degradation.

Through site-directed mutagenesis of ASIC3, RPRFa was shown to interact with the lower palm domain (the non-proton sensing domain) of ASIC3 [210] and extensive analysis identified numerous beta sheet regions of the palm domain to be involved in rASIC3 current kinetics: Leu77, Glu79, Gln269, Gln271, Arg376, Ala378, Glu380 and Glu423.",

By contrast, the natural tea flavonoid (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, Figure 9c ) is more potent and selectively inhibits ASIC3 with an IC 50 of 13.2 \u00b5M at pH 5; injection of 100 \u00b5mol/L also significantly attenuated acid-induced pain responses in mice [216] . Another herbal medicine used for headaches is gastrodin (Figure 9d ), a constituent of Gastrodia elata, which inhibits the amplitude of ASIC-like currents in DRG neurones (IC 50 21 \u00b5M, at pH 5.5) and attenuates acetic acid evoked pain [217] .

In a similar manner, chlorogenic acid (CGA, a natural organic structure common in plants, Figure 9f ), inhibits transient acid-evoked currents in DRG neurones with an IC 50 of 23.5 \u00b5M, given rASIC3 is predominant in rat DRG neurone and the nature of the biphasic currents measured, the inhibition observed with CGA is likely due to ASIC3 inhibition; localized injections (1-10 \u00b5M) also attenuated acetic-acid-induced pain behavior [220] . In a prior neuropathic behavior study in rats, 200 mg/kg IP injections of CGA produced a similar effect to the analgesic gabapentin (100 mg/ kg) [221] ; however, the effect of CGA reduced rapidly over time, which may be due to fast metabolism and/ or a significant degree of excretion compared to the synthetic compound gabapentin; albeit direct ASIC involvement was not tested.",

Interestingly, the in vivo doses of NS383 which produced analgesia (10-60 mg/kg) were not much higher than morphine (3-10 mg/ kg, a centrally acting opioid), but much more potent than amiloride (50-200 mg/kg) and acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol, 100-400 mg/kg).

In vitro co-expression of stomatin with mASIC3 leads to reduced transient current amplitude without altering the sustained phase or expression level, compared to cells only expressing mASIC3 [231] . Equally, in vitro transfection of stomatin-like protein 3 (STOML3) with ASIC3 results in reduced current amplitude and sustained currents (at pH 5 and 6) compared to when ASIC3 is expressed alone [232] . The in vivo implications of this have been studied in mice, STOML3 \u2212/mice showing an exacerbated reduction in mechanosensitivity of certain sensory neurones compared to ASIC3 \u2212/mice [233] . Lastly, coexpression of STOML1 with ASIC3 leads to faster inactivation of mASIC3 currents (pH 4 and 6) [234] . Investigation of how stomatin might interact with ASIC3 demonstrated that the C terminus of ASIC3 is important, in particular Leu488+ Leu489, mutation of which causes larger ASIC3-mediated currents and diminished inhibition by stomatin at pH 4.0 [235] . Further analysis has shown that the C terminus of ASIC3 is important for ASIC3-stomatin to physically interact and that transmembrane domain 1 of ASIC3 is critical for the modulation of ASIC3 function by stomatin, as demonstrated by chimera experiments with ASIC1a, which is not inhibited by stomatin [236] .",

There has also to date not yet been an investigation of the contribution of ASIC3 to a chronic pain condition, for example, what is the phenotype of ASIC3 \u2212/mice undergoing destabilization of the medial meniscus model of OA, which develops and is sustained over many weeks. Conducting such a long-term study would enable assessment of whether or not ASIC3 expression changes at different time points and perhaps enable it to be determined as to whether or not the sustained phase plays a role in chronic pain? Also, in humans, is there a role for ASIC3 in chronic pain? At least for acute acid-evoked pain in humans, recent data suggest no role for ASICs [22, 238] , which contrasts with older literature [21, 23] , but how this scenario is altered in chronic pain states associated with prolonged tissue acidosis and the presence of multiple inflammatory mediators, many of which sensitize ASIC3, remains unknown.",

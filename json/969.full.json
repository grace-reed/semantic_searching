Changes in gene expression can play an important role in both. Significant advances in our understanding of gene regulatory plasticity and evolution have come from comparative studies in the field and laboratory. Experimental evolution provides another powerful path by which to learn about how differential regulation of genes and pathways contributes to both acclimation and adaptation. Here we present results from one such study using the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. We selected one set of lines to withstand heat stress and another oxidative stress. We then compared transcriptional responses to acute heat stress of both and an unselected control to the ancestral population using a weighted gene coexpression network analysis, finding that the transcriptional response is primarily dominated by a plastic response that is shared in the ancestor and all evolved populations. In addition, we identified several modules that respond to artificial selection by (1) changing the baseline level of expression, (2) altering the magnitude of the plastic response, or (3) a combination of the two. Our findings therefore reveal that while patterns of transcriptional response can be perturbed with short bouts of intense selection, the overall ancestral structure of transcriptional plasticity is largely maintained over time.

Furthermore, novel environments in the wild may present several stresses simultaneously that can lead to a correlated response in means of different phenotypes (e.g., Grant and Grant 1995; Fischer et al. 2007), and a shared genetic basis may lead to covariance of phenotypic plasticity of different traits across environments (e.g., Czesak et al. 2006; Stinchcombe et al. 2010).

Gene expression levels can be characterized as a norm of reaction for a given genotype across environments (Figure 1 ). If populations of organisms continue to experience the new environment long enough for genetic changes to accumulate, then gene reaction norms can change both in basal expression levels and in the plasticity of expression itself (Figure 1 ).",

For the oxidative-selected line, all replicates were collected from a single thawed population of worms. Worms were raised at 20\u00b0until the population was large enough to collect enough individuals for RNA isolation. Age-synchronized L1 larvae were raised for 20 hr in liquid medium at either 20\u00b0or 30\u00b0( Figure S1 ). Prior to tissue collection, larval worms were passed through a 20-mm Nitex screen to remove unhatched eggs and dead adults. Total RNA was isolated from approximately 100,000 pooled individuals using standard TRIzol methods. Sequencing libraries were prepared according to the protocols as previously described (Sikkink et al. 2014b; Sikkink et al. 2014a) .

To do this, we selected four of the six replicates for each treatment group at random to create a new subsampled dataset with 32 samples each. A total of 100 resampled datasets were created in this way. Using the same parameters as in the full dataset, we reconstructed the gene coexpression network for each of the resampled datasets. We then assessed whether each gene belonged in a given module by the following criteria. (1) If a module within a resampled network comprised at least 10% of a module in the full network, the genes in the resampled module were considered a significant group within the original module. Thus, each module from the full network could consist of several well-supported modules from the resampled data, but the network topology is biased toward the modules created from the full dataset. (2) Every gene from the resampled modules that was included in such a group in at least 70% of the resampled networks was determined to be strongly supported as a member of that module in the original network. All genes that did not meet these criteria were removed to the \"unassigned\" bin. After poorly supported genes were removed from each module, we merged highly correlated modules together based on the correlations among module eigengenes. Modules with highly correlated eigengenes (r . 0.9) were merged into single modules. Finally, the genes from any remaining modules that contained fewer than the minimum cluster size of 30 genes were moved to the \"unassigned\" bin.",

Both the oxidative and heat selected lines diverged from the ancestral population on Axis 2, but in opposite directions ( Figure 2D ). In contrast, the control population separated from the ancestral and selected populations on Axis 3 ( Figure 2E ). This pattern of divergence from the ancestor suggests that the three different selection regimes (two stresses and lab adaptation) lead to unique changes in transcriptome regulation in these populations. In addition, the response to the temperature treatment was strongly dependent on the population (PERMANOVA, population-by-temperature interaction: F 3,40 = 1.77, P = 0.002).

In fact, the two largest modules, Module 1 and Module 2, show effects only attributable to temperature (\"shared plasticity\"). Module 1 is composed of genes that are upregulated in all populations under immediate heat stress, whereas Module 2 contains genes that are downregulated in response to heat (Figure 3) . The largest class of modules retained the overall pattern of plasticity displayed across populations, but changed their baseline level of expression within each environment (\"divergent baseline\", Figure 3 , Table 1 ). Finally, four of the modules showed heterogeneity among the pattern of plasticity that was dependent upon their specific evolutionary history (\"evolved and/or divergent plasticity\", Figure 3 ). In one case (Module 5), the oxidative stress population lost its apparent response to heat stress entirely, indicative of genetic assimilation.",

Focusing specifically within the ancestral population, five modules (Modules 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7), which together contain 4,836 genes, had significant expression differences across environments (Table 2) . Evolved lines that diverged from the ancestral population are of particular interest, as these could indicate a set of genes that are adaptive for stress resistance. Two modules, Module 6 and Module 9, differed in the heat-selected population only. These modules are expected to contain genes that are important for adaptation to heat stress. Similarly, five modules (3, 4, 5, 7, and 8) are significantly different from the ancestor only in the oxidative-selected population. Two additional modules, Module 10 and Module 13, have evolved in both stress-selected populations. In both cases, the responses are in opposite directions in each stress-selected population (Figure 3) , similar to the observed differences on Axis 2 in the nMDS analysis ( Figure 2B) . Surprisingly, among the unassigned genes, we observed a significant effect of both temperature and population in the eigengene expression, supporting the observation that a pattern of \"divergent baseline\" predominates the overall structure of the evolution of gene expression across the genome (Table 1) . Given the conservative approach we used to assign genes into modules following resampling, it is likely that genes contributing to the unassigned modules were falsely removed from a real module. However the proportion of variance explained by the eigengene for the unassigned module is relatively small (9.3%). Therefore, it is unlikely that the lack of module assignment for these genes substantially alters the overall network topology we have observed.",

However, ChIP binding data from C. elegans was not yet available for some key transcription factors involved in stress response, particularly HSF-1 and HIF-1. Heat shock proteins are known to be regulated by HSF-1 in response to heat stress (Wu 1995; \u00c5kerfelt et al. 2010) , therefore enrichment of hsps in Module 9 may indicate a role for HSF-1 in regulation of that module. DISCUSSION For many organisms, phenotypic plasticity is a vital adaptation that has evolved to cope with environmental stress. After almost a century of work on plasticity, researchers are now beginning to dissect the genetic regulatory networks that underlie a plastic phenotypic response (Promislow 2005; Barchuk et al. 2007; Rose et al. 2016; Nocedal et al. 2017) . Here, we add to this growing body of work by examing global changes in gene expression in the evolution of phenotypically plastic responses using experimental evolution of C. remanei in response to the two related, but distinct, evolutionary stresses of heat and oxidative shock.",

Exposure to the inducing temperature resulted in very pronounced changes in the global patterns of gene expression in all populations, which were primarily encapsulated by the primary axis resulting from nMDS analysis (Figure 2A ). The scale of the observed response to the temperature shift in all populations ( Figure 2C ) largely confirms our previous observations for the heat selected population. Increased resistance to acute heat stress is not conferred by changing the degree to which genes respond to changes in the thermal environment (Sikkink et al. 2014b) . However, the more powerful multivariate statistical framework used here reveals that the response to temperature changes did in fact differ among the evolved populations on secondary axes of ordination. These interaction effects were most evident on nMDS Axes 4 and 5 ( Figure 2F and 2G) , and suggest that some changes in transcriptional plasticity may be responsible for changes in phenotypic plasticity as well.",

These findings are consistent with the observations we have previously made-that there is no genetic correlation between heat and oxidative resistance under the environmental conditions in which these populations evolved (Sikkink et al. 2015) .

It is surprising that it is the heat-selected line that utilized novel stress response components, while oxidative selection in large part modified the existing stress response pathway. Because the eigengene is a combined metric of expression for multiple correlated genes, a trivial interpretation is that some individual genes within this module do in fact respond significantly to temperature in the ancestor, but we have limited power to detect the change when considered as a group.

In general, patterns of ancestral plasticity dominated the evolutionary response, with the predominant mode of adaptation occurring through changes in baseline gene expression within an environment rather than changes in plasticity per se. The evolutionary responses to the two different stressors each modified unique modules, consistent with previous observations of low pleiotropy between these two responses (Sikkink et al. 2015) . Surprisingly, the response in the population selected under heat stress conditions did not modify components of the ancestral response to heat shock, while the oxidative selection line did. We identified a number of modules with significant evolutionary and plastic responses that were enriched for targets of key developmental and stress response transcription factors. The scale of the total number of genes involved is daunting, however. Indeed, a major conclusion from this work is that short-term adaptation, although it may be built upon existing systems that facilitate a plastic response to the environment, can nonetheless alter the overall pattern of regulation of the majority of the genes in the genome (Boyle et al. 2017) . Complex responses to environmental stress remain complex even when adapting to simplified selective environments.",

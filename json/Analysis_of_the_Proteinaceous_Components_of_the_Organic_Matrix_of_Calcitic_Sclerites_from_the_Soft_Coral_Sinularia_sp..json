                "text": "Soft corals contain small spicules of CaCO 3 called ''sclerites'', which are biomineralized structures composed of an organic matrix and a mineral fraction [1, 2, 3] . They define key parameters for the structural design of a soft body [3] . The formation of biominerals by living organisms is fastidiously controlled by proteins and polysaccharides [4, 5] that ensure the development of crystals with a particular composition and morphology, guarantee the manufacture of structures with strictly defined shapes, and dictate the internal and external physicochemical properties of the resulting materials [5, 6, 7] . Prominent among these are intracrystalline proteins, which are distributed throughout the individual biomineral crystals and play a vital role in dictating the texture and physical properties of calcified tissues of most marine organisms [6] . The organic matrix associated with the sclerites of soft corals primarily consists of proteins. Therefore, to better understand the calcification process of endoskeletal sclerites in marine organisms, functional biomolecules should be identified. We applied a proteomic approach, one of the best ways to identify functional molecules, to identify the proteins thought to be involved in the biocalcification of endoskeletal sclerites and to gain a more complete understanding of the calcification process.",

Although marine organisms have been reported to contain carbonic anhydrase [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] , calcium-binding and glycosylated proteins [1, 10, 13, 14] , this is the first report of the identification of actin in sclerites. Actin is a protein that has not previously been shown to play a role in the biocalcification process of other corals except in the planular larvae of the scleractinian Galaxea fascicularis [15] , but it has been suggested that actins reach the area of biomineralization as a by-product of the secretion of other proteins involved in calcification and may not be directly involved in the biomineralization process [17] . Our results cannot decide so far whether soft coral sclerites might be formed through a biological process using the actin protein, similar to other biomolecules that were already reported in this group.",

                "text": "Actin is a protein that functions with myosin in muscle contractions [16] . It helps to construct and maintain the cytoskeletal structure within cells and forms microfilaments in mammalian cells. Actin also contributes to biological processes such as sensing the environment, internalizing membrane vesicles, moving over surfaces, and cell division. These cellular activities are complex; they depend on the interactions of actin monomers and filaments with numerous other proteins. As such, actin is a central player in cell shape and movement and participates in many important cellular processes including muscle contraction, cell motility, cell division and cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, cell signaling, and the establishment and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape [16] . An important, unresolved question is whether actin has a function in the incorporation of extracellular materials during the calcification process in marine organisms. Recently, actin was identified in the intracellular organic matrix of sea urchin tests and spines [17] and in the planular larvae of scleractinian corals [15] but its direct involvement in the biocalcification process has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we found that actin proteins in the sclerites of Sinularia sp., which also contain the mineral calcite [14, 18] , are secreted together with an organic matrix and subsequently transported to the outside of the cell where extracellular calcification occurs. This process is similar to sclerite calcification in other octocorallians [19, 20] . Mature sclerites are completely free of cellular materials and ultimately become extracellular structures. We are tempted to exclude actin contamination from the surrounding cells as an explanation for this finding due to the many peptide fragments identified as actin from a complex protein mixture that was purified from silver-stained protein bands using our newly established matrix protein purification technique [1, 14] . However, verification of these proteins using a number of techniques (e.g., CBB staining, western blotting, silver staining, and analyses by nanoLC-MS/MS using a MALDI-TOF-TOF) was done several times on the same protein bands with the same results.",

Consequently, we used such an approach for an overview analysis of the matrix proteins contained in the soft coral Sinularia sp. The total soluble organic matrix (SOM) and the eight main purified proteins (dubbed SSCL-150, SSCL-100, SSCL-75, SSCL-63, SSCL-42, SSCL-33.5, SSCL-31, and SSCL-14 according to their predicted molecular weights) were investigated. Approximately 180 internal peptide sequences were determined by de novo sequencing. The sequence analysis strongly suggested that the protein migrating at approximately 150 kDa (i.e., SSCL-150) potentially played a role in the sclerite calcification process. Additionally, the peptide sequences corresponding to the SSCL-75 and the SSCL-14 bands matched proteins annotated as thioredoxin, hypothetical and fluorescent proteins.",

These sclerite shapes are quite different from a previously identified specimen from the same family, Alcyoniidae [1, 3, 13, 21] . Although frequently detected in other soft coral sclerites [1, 13] , spurs were not observed in the sclerites of Sinularia sp. (Fig. 1B ). Because the shape of these sclerites were completely different from other soft coral sclerites [1, 3, 13, 14, 20] , we investigated sclerites representing each of the different shapes to determine whether they indeed induced calcite mineralogy as do sclerites in other soft corals. To confirm the mineral composition, we performed micro-Raman spectroscopy on the different shapes and FTIR analysis of the powdered samples of the sclerites. The results of both analyses clearly indicated calcitic mineralogy ( Fig. 1D, E ; see figure legend for details).",

Notably, sclerites are found in the subclass Octocorallia, including members of the Gorgonacea and Alcyonacea; all sclerites in this subclass are composed of calcite [14, 20] . We noted that the sclerite shape in Sinularia sp. was different from that of other Alcyonacea [3, 23] and Gorgonacea [24] . Scale-shaped or rounded sclerites with a spherulitic structure were formed by gorgonians while spindles and rod-shaped spicules were common among gorgonians and pennatulids. These observations clearly suggest that sclerite shapes are species-specific and that within a species they generally differ according to the anatomical site at which they are formed. Very recently, a crystallographic structure [25] and a distribution pattern of calcite mineral [26] in soft coral sclerites have been reported in detail. However, although morphological studies of sclerites have been previously reported and form the basis of octocoral taxonomy, the complete biochemical and proteomic analyses of these important skeletal elements has been lacking to date. Here, we present the results of such analyses.",

Glycoproteins are known to function as inhibitors or stabilizers by binding the precursor amorphous CaCO 3 (ACC), which acts as a template for the transition of ACC to structured crystals on an insoluble or soluble organic matrix [27] . Of the eight proteins isolated, four showed strong glycosylation, revealing the potential function of these proteinaceous matrices. In addition, actin and thioredoxin sequences were obtained from glycosylated protein bands indicating that these two important proteins are glycosylated. Glycoproteinaceous matrices are commonly found in other calcifying systems [28] . Tompa et al. [29] described the insoluble matrix of snail egg shells as being a sulfated glycoprotein of 53 kDa. Based on studies of proteins in other animals, it appears that actin is also glycosylated [30] . However, this is the first study to identify actin as one of the glycosylated proteins found in the organic matrix of a calcifying marine organism. As mentioned above, glycosylated proteins are important for the biomineralization process. Evidence from octocorallians and from our previous reports [1, 13, 14] suggest that at least one protein involved in biomineralization in calcifying marine organisms must be a glycoprotein. Therefore, the functional role(s) of glycosylated proteins in calcifying organisms, and in particular within the octocorallians, definitely requires further investigation. The presence of an organic matrix or sheath appears to be a requirement for all calcifying systems. Kingsley et al. [28] reported that mature sclerites contained 5.9% organic material by weight, most of which was protein; an observation supported by our results. Gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of many proteins along with their amino acid compositions. It has been reported that protein is always present in scleractinian coral skeletons [31] and that it comprises approximately 0.3% of the dry skeleton by weight [31, 32] .",

This behavior is similar to that of reverse-phase HPLC columns. The samples were injected using a peristaltic pump (NeoLab Mini Pump) at a flow rate of 1 drop/s to separate the soluble macromolecules. The Sep-PakH Plus C 18 cartridges were activated by methanol (4 mL/3 times) prior to the application of the samples. The cartridges were washed with distilled water (DW) (6 mL/2 times) after activation. After passing the samples through the cartridges, most of the EDTA was assumed to have been removed, and the macromolecules were assumed to remain in the cartridges. To completely remove the EDTA, we passed DW (6 mL/5 times) through each cartridge followed by 10% acetonitrile (2 mL/3 times). Finally, the absorbed macromolecules were eluted in 50% acetonitrile (2 mL/3 times). The eluted macromolecules were frozen at 280uC and subsequently lyophilized. (2) Each lyophilized sample was weighed (2 mg) and mixed with 0.4 mL of 99% chloroform (CHCl 3 ), 0.2 ml of 100% methanol (MeOH), and 0.4 ml of H 2 O, and then centrifuged (1500 rpm) using an IKAH VORTEX (GENIUS 3) three times for six min each to remove the lipids and other unwanted substances. The sample was then concentrated by centrifugation in an Amicon Ultrafree-MC (Millipore) column using a Minispin Plus centrifuge (Eppendorf) and dried using a centrifugal concentrator (VC-36N, TAITEC) under a vacuum at 60uC.

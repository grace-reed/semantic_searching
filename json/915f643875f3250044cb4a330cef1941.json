Rapid environmental fluctuations and phenotypic plasticity through optimization of fitness-related traits in organisms play important roles in shaping intraspecific divergence. The coastal systems experience strong variations in multiple abiotic environmental factors, especially the temperature. We used a typical intertidal species, Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), to investigate the interaction between plasticity and adaptive evolution. We collected intertidal and subtidal oysters from two ecological niches and carried out common garden experiments for one generation. We identified fine-scale vertical adaptive divergence between intertidal and subtidal F 1 progeny at both sites, based on different hierarchical phenotypes, including morphological, physiological, and molecular traits. We further quantified the global plasticity to thermal stress through transcriptomic analysis. The intertidal oysters exhibited slow growth rate. However, they showed high survival and metabolic rates under heat stress, indicating vertically fine-scale phenotypic adaptive mechanisms and evolutionary trade-offs between growth and thermal tolerance. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the intertidal oysters have evolved high plasticity. The genes were classified into three types: evolutionarily divergent, concordantly plastic, and adaptive plastic genes. The evolved divergence between intertidal and subtidal oysters for these gene sets showed a significant positive correlation with plastic changes of subtidal populations in response to high temperature. Furthermore, the intertidal oysters exhibited delayed large-scale increase in expressional plasticity than that in subtidal counterparts. The same direction between plasticity and selection suggests that the oysters have evolved adaptive plasticity. This implies that adaptive plasticity facilitates the oyster to adapt to severe intertidal zones. The oysters exposed to strong environmental variability are thermal tolerant and have high adaptive potential to face",

                "text": "Understanding the responses of organisms to stressful or novel environments with strong selection pressures is one of the long-standing problems in evolutionary biology. Furthermore, adaptive evolution driven by high degree of environmental variability, currently a major threat to global biodiversity (Bay et al., 2017) , has gained attention recently (Sanford and Kelly, 2011; Vargas et al., 2017) . The coastal zones experience strong spatial (tidal level) and temporal (seasonal and daily) environmental fluctuations, such as temperature and exposure time to extreme low tide. Organisms experience high variations in temperature fluctuation at different intertidal zones that are just a few meters apart (Gracey et al., 2008) , which provide interesting models to investigate environmentinduced adaptive evolution in response to exacerbated global climate change (Zhang et al., 2012; Vargas et al., 2017) . Fine-scale vertical adaptive divergence has been reported in many marine organisms inhabiting high and low intertidal zones (Petes et al., 2008; Place et al., 2012; Bedulina et al., 2013) despite high gene flow in some species with longtime planktonic larval period (Bozinovic et al., 2011; Sanford and Kelly, 2011) . Furthermore, studies have reported that intertidal organisms have evolved higher phenotypic plasticity than the subtidal counterparts in order to adapt to fluctuating environments (Somero, 2012; Kenkel et al., 2013; Kenkel and Matz, 2016) . Phenotypic plasticity refers to the ability of a single genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to variable environmental gradients (Pfennig et al., 2010) . However, systematical investigations of vertically fine-scale adaptive evolution are rarely reported by integrating fitnessrelated traits and omic analysis.",

                "text": "The phenotypes influencing the fitness of an individual are recognized as adaptive traits. Variations in fitness-related morphological and physiological traits along spatial and temporal scales are considered important aspects to assess the evolutionary potential of intraspecific populations inhabiting variable environmental gradients (Bozinovic et al., 2011; Somero, 2012) . However, the importance of phenotypic mechanisms to adaptive evolution has been underestimated due to random noise. Physiological responses of organisms to environmental changes are particularly important given the current scenario of global warming. In addition to the fitness-related trait of growth (Hice et al., 2012; Burford et al., 2014) , the responses to acute thermal stress under sublethal and extreme temperatures have been frequently used to evaluate temperature adaptation at whole-organism, cellular, and biochemical levels (Somero, 2012; Yampolsky et al., 2014) . Furthermore, in recent studies, molecular phenotypes (such as gene expression) are being increasingly used to identify adaptive divergence in response to a wide range of abiotic stressors, especially temperature (Somero, 2012; Bedulina et al., 2013; Kenkel et al., 2013; Dayan et al., 2015) . Whole-genome gene expression profile is the proximate mechanism that links genotype to phenotype. It has been hypothesized to be of adaptive importance in providing raw material for the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Comparative transcriptional analysis can accurately quantify the ability of plasticity among populations dwelling in different environments (Fischer et al., 2016; Kenkel and Matz, 2016) . The organisms inhabiting highly fluctuating environments alternatively enhance their evolutionary responses by typically evolving adaptive phenotypic plasticity (Scoville and Pfrender, 2010; Nadeau et al., 2017) . Furthermore, molecular phenotypes can be efficiently used to identify the direction of plasticity and evolution (adaptive or non-adaptive, Fischer et al., 2016) . Both play important roles in adaptive evolution; however, adaptive plasticity potentiates evolutionary rescue by increasing the survival of organisms, especially those dwelling in heterogeneous environments (Markov and Ivnitsky, 2016) . Thus, it can buffer the effects of climate change and provide more time for evolution. Furthermore, it will help evaluate the evolutionary potential of a species confronting aggravated environmental challenges, especially non-traditional model organisms, such as marine invertebrates.",

Oyster reefs are vital for the health of the coast because they effectively protect shorelines, provide habitat and food for numerous species, and improve the quality of water. Degradation of this suspensionfeeding oyster reef community might predispose estuaries to increased environmental deterioration. About 85% of oyster reefs have already been lost globally, and even worse, more than 90% of oyster reefs are lost along the northern coasts of China due to anthropogenic activities and climate change (Beck et al., 2011) . Furthermore, the global average warming in the surface temperature of sea over the past half century is 0.11 \u2022 C per decade, and one of the warming maximum is present around 40 \u2022 of the Northern Hemisphere (Rhein et al., 2013) . Effective protection and reestablishment of oyster reefs are of great importance, which require deep characterization of the existed genetic resources.",

                "text": "Asia Pacific is believed to be the epicenter of oyster speciation because of the presence of a large number of oyster species (Ren et al., 2010) . The Pacific oyster, native to Northeastern Asia, is a naturally dominant species of the northern coast of China (Ruesink et al., 2005) . It is used as a model species to study intertidal adaptation (Somero, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2015) . In the present study, we investigated fine-scale vertical adaptive divergence with the role of plasticity in adaptive landscape as the supplement (from our previous study) focusing on regional divergence (Li et al., 2018) in oyster populations from different latitudes. The intertidal and subtidal oysters from two sampling sites of the Bohai Sea, within the warming sensitive zone, were collected and common gardened for one generation to potentially minimize the effects of environment (Sanford and Kelly, 2011) . We aimed to examine adaptive divergence at vertical level and the role of plasticity in adaptive evolution by specific phenomic and transcriptomic analyses. Understanding the responses of adaptive traits and plastic changes to environmental factors, especially high temperature, will (1) help understand the interaction between phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution in the marine organism, (2) help forecast adaptive potential of oyster populations (including other coastal animals) inhabiting different ecological niches facing rapid global climate change, and (3) provide insights into the oyster resource conservation and reef reestablishment, which will ultimately advance effective management of marine ecosystem. Figure 1) . Common garden experiments were conducted according to the methods of Li et al. (2017) Figure 2) . Eggs from 30 uncontaminated mature female oysters of each population were mixed and divided into 30 replicates. Each replicate was fertilized individually with the sperms from 30 mature male oysters. The zygotes were incubated in a 70L plastic container. At the D-shaped stage, six containers were combined to form one group with three culture replicates. All culture replicates were well maintained in the sea. Before the experiments, the F 1 generation oysters were acclimatized in the laboratory aquarium (temperature: 14.2-18.2 \u2022 C; salinity: 31.3 \u00b1 0.5 ) for 2 weeks with aerated, filtered seawater. The oysters were fed commercial spirulina powder. The seawater was changed every day during this period.",

This vertical adaptive divergence at local scale might be maintained by purifying selection (Sanford and Kelly, 2011) . Furthermore, adaptive plasticity will favor high plasticity in rapidly changing environments, such as intertidal zones, by maintaining population size (Fischer et al., 2016; Markov and Ivnitsky, 2016) .

The intertidal oysters showed higher survival rate, metabolic rate, and expressional plasticity under high temperature; however, they exhibited constrained growth. The results elucidate fine-scale adaptive divergence along the sharp vertical gradient at different hierarchical networks from phenotypic (morphological and physiological) to molecular levels, which has been observed in many marine invertebrates (Bozinovic et al., 2011; Somero, 2012; Kenkel and Matz, 2016) . Most importantly, it also suggests the recruitment of evolutionarily energetic trade-offs. This adaptive mechanism is prevalent in the marine mollusks, such as eastern oysters, mussels, and snails, inhabiting highly heterogeneous thermal environment (intertidal zone); they are more thermal tolerant, but exhibit slow growth (Bayne, 2004; Petes et al., 2008) . Furthermore, it supports the energy balance theory, that is, organisms should maintain homeostasis between the energy for fitness-related functions and the basal maintenance to environmental stressors (Sanford and Kelly, 2011; Sokolova et al., 2012) . The theory could well explain the slow growth of intertidal oysters, where most energy was used to adapt to rapidly changing intertidal environments. In addition, the transcriptomic data showed clear vertical differentiation at different tidal heights in both the sampling sites. The whole-genome gene expression profile also revealed clear adaptive divergence between the mussels inhabiting different vertical levels (Place et al., 2012) .",

Further, the oysters also showed a similar pattern of phenotypic variations along the latitudinal gradient. The oysters inhabiting relatively benign environments (LT) exhibited high growth at both the developmental stages and glycogen content in comparison with those of more stressed counterparts (BYQ) at the same vertical level. However, the oysters from BYQ had high protein content and survival rate when exposed to acute heat stress. Our findings further demonstrate latitudinal adaptive divergence and support the evolutionary trade-offs between development and thermal tolerance in the oyster. This is consistent with our previous findings of adaptive divergence between northern and southern oyster populations, that is, oysters in the northern coasts (high environmental variability) are thermal tolerant, but with constrained growth (Li et al., 2018) . High growth rate under moderate environment conditions has been reported in the congener eastern oyster and Atlantic silverside (Hice et al., 2012; Burford et al., 2014) . The energetic trade-offs among diverse adaptive traits have been observed in different marine ectotherms in response to various stressors (P\u00f6rtner, 2010; Pan et al., 2015; Sussarellu et al., 2016) . This has been reported in aquatic fishes, as well (Dupont-Prinet et al., 2010; Killen, 2014) . The physiological evolutionary trade-offs between oysters at both vertical and latitudinal gradients indicate the phenotypic adaptive mechanisms of this marine invertebrate.",

A strong pattern of positive association was observed between evolved divergence and plastic changes for all three types of genes in the two subtidal oyster populations under heat stress. This indicates that the direction of change in gene expression in the subtidal oysters under thermal stress is overwhelmingly in the same direction to that of evolved changes, indicating evolution toward adaptive plasticity (Ghalambor et al., 2015; Fischer et al., 2016) . Several studies have observed this positive relationship between the direction of plasticity and evolved divergence of mRNA expression in coastal fishes (Fraser et al., 2014; Shaw et al., 2014) and other marine species by proteomic and physiological analyses (Schaum and Collins, 2014; Makinen et al., 2016) . We suggest that this adaptive plasticity can contribute to the adaptive evolution of organisms inhabiting highly heterogeneous environments. In particular, the intertidal oysters have optimized phenotypic integration to achieve optimal fitness by constraining growth and by enhancing thermal tolerance and plasticity, and vice versa in subtidal oysters. The adaptive plasticity will buffer the intertidal populations from extinction and provide long time for evolutionary responses to environmental change (Nadeau et al., 2017) . The plastic responses will efficiently predict the direction of subsequent evolutionary processes (Fischer et al., 2016) . Further, the intertidal populations inhabiting highly variable environments might have high adaptive potential and weak extinction risk considering the current global warming. The future studies on genetic mechanisms of adaptive plasticity are necessary to deeply understand the relationship between genetic composition and plasticity.",

The evolution of magnitude of transcriptomic plasticity was examined and found to be distinctly different among sampled oysters along both vertical and latitudinal gradients. The organisms from high fluctuating environments (intertidal vs. subtidal and northern vs. southern populations) have evolved greater transcriptional plastic changes in response to heat stress. A similar transcriptomic divergence at vertical gradient has been demonstrated in the corals, where the inshore population exhibited enhanced plasticity to adapt to variable environments of inshore zones (Kenkel and Matz, 2016) . Furthermore, a similar latitudinal divergence pattern of increased expressional plasticity was observed in other oyster populations dwelling in more heterogeneous northern environment in comparison with that of their southern counterparts (Li et al., 2018) . In the present study, the time of large-scale increased plastic changes of the three types of genes in the subtidal oysters was earlier than that in the intertidal populations under high temperature. This indicates that the subtidal oysters are thermal sensitive because the high degree of plastic changes in the organisms under challenging conditions always requires more energy and material costs (DeWitt et al., 1998; Siljestam and Ostman, 2017) . The results suggest that the populations from high temporospatial variable climate (especially temperature disturbance) will evolve high plasticity and be less vulnerable to increasing climate change (Nadeau et al., 2017) . Our findings provide direct evidence for resource conservation, especially for oysters with low plasticity, in the context of exacerbated global warming. Furthermore, understanding the evolutionary responses can help select suitable genetic recourses with high adaptive potential for the reestablishment of oyster reefs.",

Similar findings have been reported in other marine animals, such as coastal teleost fish (Whitehead and Crawford, 2006; Dayan et al., 2015) and the freshwater fish pike cichlid (Ghalambor et al., 2015) . Further, the number of evolutionarily divergent genes showing increased plastic changes did not vary significantly during heat stress. However, the dynamic expression pattern of the other two types of plastic genes was detected in response to high temperature. These results indicate that the evolutionarily divergent genes are independent of thermal stress intensity. The results further support that plasticity and evolutionary divergence work on different functional genes. Furthermore, lower amounts of evolutionarily divergent genes when compared with that of concordantly plastic genes implies that near-perfect plasticity dominates adaptive divergence of the oysters along vertical gradients (Price et al., 2003; Dayan et al., 2015) . This suggests that the oysters might have high evolutionary potential to interact with increasing global climate change at transcriptome level. The oyster larvae were proved to have evolved high evolutionary potential in response to three major marine environmental stressors (temperature, salinity, and pH) at proteome level (Dineshram et al., 2016) .",

Further studies on the genetic mechanisms of adaptive plasticity are necessary to deeply understand the relationship between genetic composition and plasticity. These patterns provide direct evidence for resource conservation, especially for the oysters with low plasticity, in the context of exacerbated global warming. Furthermore, understanding the evolutionary responses can help select suitable genetic recourses of high adaptive potential for the reestablishment of oyster reefs.",

This paper will primarily deal with the influence of accessory factors, specifically season, on the FAA pool of the freshwater scud Gammarus pseudolimnaeus Bousfield (Crustacea, Amphipoda) . In developing an in situ biochemical indicator of stress, seasonal variation is the most important accessory factor to be considered because many individual accessory factors such as diet, age, reproductive condition and molting stage are implicit in any seasonal fluctuations observed. Observed seasonal changes in FAA pool will be discussed with respect to toxicological applications of FAA and the ecology/biology of G. pseudolimnaeus.",

However, normalization to protein does not completely ensure that normalization bias was not present.

Similarly, Ferguson (1975) found the total FAA concentrations of gonad and digestive gland tissue of starfish to be greatest in winter and least in the summer. In both of these studies, seasonal changes in the total FAA concentrations were related to the reproductive cycle of the organism. Similar to the present study, Cook et al. (1972) found the total FAA pool of adult barnacles, Balanus balanoides to decrease during the winter and reach a minimum in spring, however the greatest FAA concentration was observed in the fall. Heath and Barnes (1970) found no consistent seasonal trends in the total non-protein nitrogen of the common shore crab Curcinus maenas. Similarly, Zandee et al. (1980) measured seasonal variation in the total FAA concentration of different organs of the marine mollusk Myths edulis and found no seasonal pattern, although concentrations of specific amino acids did change significantly. In freshwater crayfish the total FAA concentration was significantly greater in May as compared with February (McWhinnie, 1972) . These differences were specifically related to the molt cycle of the crayfish with the total FAA concentration increasing during the premolt period in May. Since in the majority of cases alterations in the total FAA pool have been related to accessory factors such as molt status, reproductive condition and/or diet, it is not surprising that different species from different ecosystems exhibit different seasonal patterns.",

                "text": "The total FAA concentration of G. pseudolimnaeus is similar to that reported for other freshwater invertebrates. Five different freshwater oligochaete species had total FAA concentrations which ranged from 7.8 to 50.6 nmol/mg dry wt . Similarly small concentrations of total FAA were reported for the copepod Diaptomus sp., which contained 80.9 nmol/mg (Jeffries and Alzara, 1970) . The bivalves Ligumia subrostrata and Corbiculu jhminea had considerably smaller total FAA concentrations of 23.6 nmol/mg dry wt and 2.78 nmol/mg wet wt, respectively (Hanson and Dietz, 1976; Graney, 1986) . These low FAA concentrations are not surprising, however, since organisms with tissue in direct contact with the external media, such as clams, have adapted to freshwater by maintaining a low osmotic gradient between tissue and water. Arthropods, on the other hand, have a fairly impermeable exoskeleton, which allows them to maintain a greater internal osmolyte concentration. Gardner et al. (1981) reported a total FAA concentration of 428 nmol/mg dry wt for the cladoceran Drzphnia magna. Abdominal muscle of the crayfish Astacus leptodactylus had a total FAA concentration of 545.7 and 466 nmol/mg dry wt, respectively (van Marrewijk and Ravestern, 1974; van Marrewijk and Zandee, 1975) . Similarly, crayfish of the family Orconectes had total FAA concentrations of 34.6116.3 nmol/mg wet wt in abdominal muscle (McWhinnie et al., 1972) and 42.7-50.2 nmol/mg wet wt in ventral nerve cord (Lin and Cohen, 1973) . These concentrations are considerably greater than those reported for the amphipods investigated in the present study. A possible reason for this difference is that values reported for the crayfish were for specific tissues, whereas in our study, whole organisms were analyzed. This being the case, total FAA concentrations reported for G. pseudolimnaeus may be biased toward smaller concentrations due to \"dilution\" of the homogenate by tissues or structures which have low concentrations of amino acids. This may be especially true with regard to the exoskeleton, which contributes proportionally more to the dry wt of the organism than the total FAA pool.",

In mammals, a decrease in the E/NE ratio can be indicative of a dietary protein deficiency (Munro, 1970) . This decrease is a result of a depletion of EAA, with the NEAA generally remaining constant. Protein catabolism, a known consequence of starvation in both vertebrates and invertebrates, may be initiated by the reduced concentrations of EAA (Munro, 1970; Claybrook, 1983) . Increased protein catabolism, whether initiated by energetic (Bayne, 1973) or biosynthetic requirements, can result in an alteration of the total FAA concentration as well as pattern of indivudual FAA of aquatic invertebrates. Riley (1980) found that during starvation, protein degradation increased, and over time, the composition of the FAA pool and that of protein hydrolysate became increasingly similar. Riley (1980) also observed a decrease in the E/NE ratio, however, he attributed the change to an increase in NEAA and felt that the EAA were conserved for protein synthesis. In the present study, it is possible that the decreased E/NE ratio observed in March was the result of dietary deficiencies or starvation. March was the end of the cold season, during which temperatures were near freezing for 3-4 months (Fig. 1) . Feeding activity was likely to be minimal during this time period, and the amphipods may have had a negative scope for growth. This would indicate that normal maintenance requirements exceed caloric intake, thus forcing the organism to mobilize energy storage reserves to maintain homeostasis. During the cold winter months, when food availability is greatly reduced, marine bivalves are often in a negative scope for growth during which time they rely mostly on protein reserves to meet energetic requirements (Bayne, 1973) . If this were the case in the present study, the decrease in the E/NE ratio may be indicative of the changes in protein metabolism.",

As discussed above, quantitative dietary deficiencies can alter protein metabolism and subsequently the relative composition of both essential and nonessential amino acids (Munro, 1970; Riley, 1980) . Similarly, qualitative changes in diet can alter the composition of an organisms FAA pool. For organisms which do not feed continuously, such as humans, diet generally has little influence on the FAA pool. Immediately following protein ingestion, the tissue and body fluid FAA pool may rise dramatically, however, these changes are only transitory and amino acids rapidly return to pre-ingestion concentrations, via increased protein synthesis of amino acid oxidation (Munro, 1970) . Amphipods are considered continuous feeders (Marchant and Hynes, 1981) and the constant flux of FAA via protein digestion may have a more consistent influence on the FAA pool of the organisms. Given this, changes in the qualitative aspects of an organisms diet may influence the concentration of amino acid in its tissue and fluids. Amphipod growth will vary under different regimes (Barlocher and Kendrich, 1973) , which indicates that there are optimal and suboptimal dietary conditions. Whether the FAA pool is altered under these different dietary regimes is unknown. However, protein metabolism will definitely be different in organisms with varying growth rates and, since the FAA pool is a highly dynamic pool of biomolecules responsive to alterations in protein metabolism, it is very possible that changes in dietary quality will alter the FAA pool. The primary nutritional source for the amphipods is the microbial flora which colonization leaves (Hynes, 1972) . Since this colonization is successional, in that the microbial community changes throughout the year, it is possible that the nutritional quality of the food may also change seasonally, thus affecting the organisms' FAA pool.",

The primary factors which can affect FAA on a seasonal basis would be diet, reproductive condition and molt cycle status. Other factors which also need to be considered are sex, temperature, photoperiod, developmental stage and salinity. Since all of these accessory factors are simultaneously interacting over time, it is extremely difficult to separate the effect of the individual factors. However, the influence of all of these factors will be implicit in seasonal changes in the FAA pool. In addition, when developing a biochemical indicator of stress, one is not necessarily interested in the effect of any individual accessory factor on the biochemical parameter of interest, but rather in the combined influence of the factors over time and between locations. Since the seasonal variation in FAA is the result of the combined influence of all the above accessory factors, it is, along with geographic variation, the primary component required to interpret the potential fluctuates seasonally.",

In March, the end of the winter season, the total FAA concentration was at its lowest level and the profile of relative FAA concentrations was considerably different than in the other months. Cook et al. (1972) studied seasonal changes in the FAA pool of adult barnacles Balunus bahoides. They found that starvation during the summer and winter-spring months caused a significant decrease in the total FAA concentration, however starvation during fall-winter time period resulted in an increase in the FAA concentration. Cook et al. (1972) concluded that the effect on the FAA concentration depends upon what substrate is being mobilized to meet the energy demands of the organism: mobilization of carbohydrates will increase the total FAA concentration while metabolism of lipid and/or protein will cause the total FAA concentration to decrease. Since the primary energy reserve and an organism's dietary source may shift during the year (Bayne, 1973) , it is not surprising that the total FAA concentration The reproductive cycle in aquatic invertebrates is an extemely complex process, controlled by a variety of indogenous and exogenous cues; including temperature, photoperiod and nutritional status. Seasonal variations in energy metabolism, as reflected by changes in the relative composition of glycogen, lipid and protein storage reserves, are directly related to gametogenesis (Zandee et al., 1980; Gabbot and Bayne, 1973; Newell and Bayne, 1980) . The concentrations of phosphoadenylates have been observed to vary with reproductive condition in freshwater clams (Giesy and Dickson, 1981) . The time frame of gonadal maturation is unknown in G. pseudolimnaeus, as are the seasonal changes in the concentrations of glycogen and lipids. However, assuming that the reproductive cycle is accompanied by changes in energy metabolism, then changes in the FAA pool similar to those found in other organisms would be expected. In a variety of marine invertebrates, changes in glycine have been directly linked to reproductive conditions. Maturation of male gonads in the cirripede Balanus balanus (Barnes, 1963) , the sea anemone Bunodosoma cavernala (Kasschau and McCommas, 1982; Howard and Kasschau, 1980) and the starfish Echinaster modestus (Ferguson, 1975) results in a significant accumulation of glycine in gonadal tissue. In the present study, no increase in glycine concentration was observed during the reproductively active period. However, since whole organisms were analyzed and males and females were combined, changes in the male gonadal tissue may simply have been obscured. Other studies have also shown amino acids to vary with the reproductive cycle (Zandee et al., 1980; Cook et al., 1972; Barnes et al., 1963) . The changes observed in these studies, although correlated with reproductive conditions, were more directly the result of changes in energy metabolisms which are concurrent with reproductive maturation.",

Molting can be subdivided into five major stages, each of which is characterized by changes in exoskeleton hardness and cellular and biochemical processes (Skinner, 1985) . The frequency of molting is greatest in early instar organisms, with the length of the intermolt period increasing with age (Sutcliffe and Caruck, 1981) . During intermolt and premolt, a variety of metabolic changes occur which prepare the organism for ecdysis. Blood glucose levels increase, glycogen and lipid reserves accumulate in the midgut gland and plasma and tissue FAA change (Barclay et al., 1983; Chang and O'Connor, 1983; Yamaoka and Skinner, 1976) . In freshwater crayfish, tissue FAA levels increased two-to three-fold during premolt (McWhinnie et al., 1972) . This increase may be the result of changes in protein metabolism, likely to have been initiated by hormonal changes, or may simply be a response to the increased hemolymph osmolarity which normally occurs prior to ecdysis, presumably to enhance water intake (Tucker and Costlow, 1975) . In the present study, it is impossible to distinguish changes resulting from a difference in the stage of the molt cycle, from other accessory factors. For the early instar organisms observed in July and August, during which the molt cycle interval is relatively short (5-15 days), there is a greater probability of having organisms collected at different stages of the molt cycle. This would result in greater variation in the measured FAA pool. The coefficients of variations for the total FAA pool of amphipods collected in July and August (Table 1) are two to three times greater than most other months. This increased variation could be the result of measuring FAAs in organisms at different stages of their molt cycle.",

In the present study, the amphipods FAA pool increased during the initial 5 months of growth, from July to December. Initially it was thought that this increase could be an artifact, in that normalizations to dry wt artificially lowered the FAA concentration because of the disproportionate contribution of the exoskeleton to the dry wt (see earlier). However we feel this is a real increase, since normalization to protein produced the same trend.

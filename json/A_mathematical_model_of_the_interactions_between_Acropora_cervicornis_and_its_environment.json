One such coral, which has been seriously impacted by these stressors, is the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis. To reduce the effects of such stressors, this coral utilizes fluorescent proteins (FPs) and melanin (M).

In this study we develop a mathematical model, viz., a system of ordinary differential equations that simulates the growth of A. cervicornis branches under different regimes and combinations of SST and SR. The model assumes that polyps are the functional unit of the coral and that the concentration of FPs and M are inversely proportional to SST and SR intensity. To develop the model we use empirical (birth and mortality rate of polyps and the maximum number of polyps per unit area) and theoretical parameters (concentration of FPs, M produced, and trade-offs with growth). The model simulates how changes in FPs and M due to environmental changes affect the growth capacity of A. cervicornis. The model as well as its stability analysis show that polyp growth is affected by SR and SST. Hence, the model will help in understanding how corals will respond to future changes in climate.",

Climate change is primarily associated to the atmospheric deposition of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) among others greenhouse gases. A direct consequence of this accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is the increase of sea surface temperature (SST). There is compelling evidence that points towards an increase of 0.4-0.74\u00b0C in the mean global SST during the past century (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007) . Likewise, solar radiation (SR) reaching the Earth's surface in its different wavelengths, e.g. ultraviolet radiation (UV) and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), has also increased, partly as a result of ozone layer depletion (H\u00e4der et al., 2007) . Rising SST and increased SR are physiological stressors to marine organisms; such stressors, when severe, might jeopardize vital functions such as growth, reproduction, and the capacity to fight diseases, thereby threatening the viability of coral reef populations.",

Given these resource constraints, the allocation of resources into a vital function such as immune defense will be traded-off against other vital functions such as growth. Several studies conducted on corals support this paradigm. For instance, Palmer et al. (2010) compared the activity of phenoloxidase (PO), an enzyme involved in M biosynthesis, with the number of amoebocyte-containing M granules (melanocytes) of two scleractian corals, Porites sp. and Acropora millepora. That study revealed that Porites sp. invests considerably more resources into the aforementioned immune constituent than A. millepora, as it exhibited higher numbers of melanocytes than A. millepora. This investment of resources into immunity provides Porites with higher disease and bleaching resistance. By contrast, acroporids allocate more resources into growth, when compared to Porites, as acroporid corals may growth several cm in length per month, whereas porites corals may growth several cm per year (Palmer et al., 2010) . However, for acroporids the rather rapid growth is traded-off at a cost in reduced immunity, as acroporids are among the corals most susceptible to bleaching and disease.",

FPs also have the capacity to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS), which dramatically increase under high levels of abiotic stressors, leading to coral bleaching. As in the case of FPs, M provides corals with photoprotection as well as it scatters and absorbs over 50-70% of harmful radiation such as UV radiation. M is commonly found in a corals epithelial cells, creating a physical barrier to prevent and/or reduce harmful impact of radiation. In addition, M plays an important role in the inflammatory responses such as wound healing processes and the response to pathogens (Palmer et al., 2010) . As both FP and M are components of the response to the same environmental stressor, i.e., SR and SST, we infer that the degree of each response is proportional to the insult.",

Given these resource constraints, the allocation of resources into any given life history trade, will be traded-off against others live history traits. 2 The syntheses of M and FP require the same amount of resources; for both, M and FP, the behavior in terms of synthesis is similar. 3 FP and M are synthesized within the polyps, which are the basic units of coral. 4 Corals have a logistic somatic growth. 5 SST and SR exert a similar stress to the coral and these affect both immune system constituents (M and FP) in a similar way, i.e., as SST and SR increases, the synthesis of M and FP decreases. 6 SST and SR vary at the same rate with respect to water depth (Lee et al., 2005) . 7 The effects of the two environmental variables, SST and SR, on coral polyps are embodied in the functions F d (\u02dc)'s, where d represents normalized water depth. Normalized depth is defined as the ratio of depth to maximum depth where A. cervicornis grows, i.e.,",

To accomplish this we first fitted a paraffin ribbon of 1 cm in height around the branch and counted the number of marks left on the ribbon by the corallites in the branches. Thereafter, we measured the diameter of the branch were the ribbon was fitted with a caliper to estimate the volume of the cylinder-like branches with a height 1 cm. Afterward, we divided the number of corallite marks (the equivalent to the number of polyps counted in 18 genetically distinct branches) by the cylinder volume of that branch to estimate the number of polyps per cm 3 . Finally, we calculated the maximum capacity of polyps in one cm (\u03ba a ) by averaging all the estimated number of polyps within 1 cm 3 of tissue.",

In Appendix C we state a list of remarks from which we infer Proposition 3.2. The proof of the proposition is also in Appendix C. The assumptions on that proposition comprise the stability conditions of x *3 . Proposition 3.2 can be modified by adding the assumption that inequality (C.2) holds true. In that case, x *3 is a saddle equilibrium point. The reason for this is that according to the Gershgorin disc theorem (Quateroni et al., 2007; Ger\u0161gorin, 1931) the union of the Gershgorin discs (Eq. (C.1)) contains the eigenvalues of A. Furthermore, inequality (C.2) ensures that R 1 and R 2 \u222a R 3 are disjoint, ergo R 1 must contain a real negative eigenvalue. Thus, by the Descartes's rule of signs, one of other two remaining eigenvalues must be a negative real number and the other a positive one. Therefore, x *3 is a saddle equilibrium point. It is noteworthy that if any of the eigenvalues (solutions of Eq. (12)) is zero or have a zero real part, then the stability of x *3 cannot be assessed by inspecting the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at x *3 , but rather by constructing a Lyapunov function.",

Furthermore, we showed that there is another set of conditions that determine the asymptotic stability of the equilibria (see Section 3 and Table 2 ). It is conspicuous that albeit the model has 12 parameters the core feasibility and stability conditions depend on the 3 parameter combinations p 1 , p 2 , and p 3 (defined in Eq. (6)) and on the normalized depth (d). Moreover, the signs of the p i s can be changed by changing d. In biological terms, p can be interpreted as population growth of polyps, as it affects the number of polyps born minus the number of polyps dying. Meanwhile, p 2 and p 3 can be interpreted as a difference of rates. The rates at which FP and M are synthesized minus the rates at which these chemical compounds are degraded.",

Similarly, the stability condition of x *2 makes x *3 biologically unfeasible. Regarding the stability of x *3 , the contrapositive statement of Proposition 3.2 says that if x *3 is a sink, then at least one of the following statements is true: at least one p i < 0 for i = 1, 2, 3 or there is a solution of Eq. (12) that is zero or purely imaginary, i.e., x *3 is nonhyperbolic. Hence, in our model (Eq. (2)), if x *3 is an attractor (sink), then it is either biologically unfeasible or nonhyperbolic.

The goal is to apply LaSalle invariance principle (D.1). Thus, we define \u03a9 = [0, l 1 ] \u00d7 [0, l 2 ] \u00d7 [0, l 3 ], where l 1 = \u03ba a , and l 2 , l 3 are the maximum concentrations of FP and M that a fixed volume of coral (polyps in a given volume) can produce. Note that \u03a9 is forward invariant for the following reasons: First, any trajectory (solution of Eq. (2)) that starts in \u03a9 will not escape the first octant because of the zero nullclines (Eqs. (A.1)-(A.3)). Second, neither the number of polyps nor the protein concentrations is unbounded. The number of polyps cannot increase beyond the carrying capacity, and the proteins concentrations must be bounded because the polyps synthesize proteins up to a finite positive concentration. Note also that \u03a9 is a closed and bounded subset of 3 , thus it is compact (Hasser and Sullivan, 1991) . Next we show that V is a Lyapunov function (D). Observe that3 2x 3 and V(x *1 ) = 0. We proceed to establish the nonincreasing property of V along the trajectories given by Eq. (2). Let g(x, \u03bc) be the RHS of Eq. (2). We assume x \u2208 \u03a9 and obtain the following: Observe that because p < 0, p 2 < 0, p 3 < 0, andis a Lyapunov function in \u03a9. We emphasize that to apply LaSalle's principle we only need the nonincreasing property of V to hold true.",

The proof of the proposition is also shown in this section.Because the degree of the polynomial in Eq. 12is 3, the equation has either 3 real solutions or 1 real solution and 2 complex solutions (a complex conjugate pair). 2 By Descartes's rule of signs (see Appendix E), regardless of the value taken by c we conclude the following:, then all the components of x *3 are positive and the characteristic polynomial of the matrixis given by Eq. 12whose solutions are given by the Cardano and Tartaglia's formulae. Since we assumed that none of the expressions in Cardano and Tartaglia's formulae is purely imaginary or zero, then x *3 is an hyperbolic equilibrium and by Hartman-Grobmann theorem (Meiss, 2008) the linearization of Eq. (2) is sufficient to describe such equation in a neighborhood of x *3 . Owing to the Descartes's rule of signs Eq. (12) has exactly 1 positive real root. Thereby, just one of the following two cases holds:\u2022 Case 1: The discriminant 12 of Eq. (12) is nonnegative. Hence, all the roots are real. Inasmuch as we assumed that they are nonzero, by Descartes's rule of signs, then 1 of them is positive and the other 2 must be negative. Ergo, x *3 must be a saddle equilibrium.\u2022 Case 2: The discriminant of Eq. (12) is negative. Thus, one of the roots is real and the other are a complex conjugate pair. Owing to the Descartes's rule of signs and because we assumed nonzero roots, the real root must be positive. Additionally, we supposed that the real parts of the complex conjugate pair are nonzero. Thus, if the real parts of the complex conjugate pair are positive, then x *3 is an unstable equilibrium whereas if the real parts of the complex conjugate pair are negative, then x *3 is a saddle equilibrium.",

If V is decreasing, i.e. dV/dt < 0, then the equilibrium is asymptotically stable (Meiss, 2008) . The LaSalle invariance principle generalizes even more the concept of Lyapunov function in that only the decreasing property is needed. For completeness' sake we state the LaSalle invariance principle.Theorem D.1 (LaSalle 1).

The equilibrium curve is a continuation curve. It is constructed starting from an equilibrium point and changing a model parameter. The classification of points in the equilibrium curve involves two things: the computation of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the corresponding point in the equilibrium curve and the evaluation of different test functions. A detailed explanation on how the points are classified and about the meaning of the categories can be found in Dhooge et al. (2006) , Meiss (2008) . The points are classified according to the following categories:\u2022 A fold point, also known as limit point, is an equilibrium point for which the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the equilibrium has an eigenvalue that becomes zero as a parameter crosses certain value (bifurcation value). A limit point indicates that a saddle-node bifurcation might occur.\u2022 A Hopf point is an equilibrium point for which the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the equilibrium has a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues that cross the imaginary axis as a parameter crosses certain value. A Hopf point indicates either that a Hopf bifurcation (birth of limit cycle) or that a more complex codimension 2 bifurcation might be occurring. That depends on the sign of the first Lyapunov coefficient as well as other factors.\u2022 A neutral saddle point is a point with two real eigenvalues that sum zero. A neutral saddle indicates that a codimension 2 bifurcation or a more complex bifurcation related to an homoclinic 13 or heteroclinic 14 orbit might exist. It is noteworthy that both, neutral saddle and Hopf point, are zeros of one of the test functions that MATCONT uses to detect them.Based on the work of Dhooge et al. (2006) , Govaerts et al. (2005) , Govaerts (2000) we did bifurcation analysis using the following procedure. 13 Loosely speaking an homoclinic orbit is a trajectory that connects a saddle point to itself. 14 Informally, an heteroclinic orbit is a trajectory that connects two saddle equilibrium points. An homoclinic orbit is a special case where the two equilibria are the same.A. Nieves-Gonz\u00e1lez, et al.

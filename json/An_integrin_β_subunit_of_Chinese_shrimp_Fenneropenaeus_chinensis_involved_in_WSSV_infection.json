The full-length cDNA of Fc\u03b2Int consists of 2853 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 783 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point of 5.09. The deduced amino acid sequence of Fc\u03b2Int possessed the classical domains of \u03b2 integrin, including the \u03b2A domain and four epidermal-growth-factor (EGF)-like domains, which shared highest similarity with a \u03b2 integrin of Pacifastacus leniusculus. The Fc\u03b2Int mRNA was highly expressed in hemocytes, heart and gill, and moderately in gonad and intestine, whereas low expression level was found in muscle and hepatopancreas. Fc\u03b2Int mRNA in gill was significantly up-regulated in 24 h and then gradually decreased below the control level in response to WSSV challenge. The cDNA fragment encoding the extracellular region of Fc\u03b2Int (Fc\u03b2Int-ER) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and polyclonal antibodies against recombinant Fc\u03b2Int-ER (rFc\u03b2Int-ER) were produced, which could specifically react to the hemocyte membrane by immunofluorescence assay and recognize a 120 kDa protein in the hemocytes by western blotting. By ELISA and dot-blot binding assay, rFc\u03b2Int-ER exhibited specific WSSV binding activity. Neutralization assay in vivo further demonstrated that rFc\u03b2Int-ER could partially block WSSV infection to shrimp. These results suggested that Fc\u03b2Int plays an important role in WSSV infection.",

These receptors are widely expressed in metazoans from sponges to humans (Hughes, 2001) . In mammals, there are 18 \u03b1 and 8 \u03b2 subunits identified to form at least 24 different receptors, the functional importance of which in the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis is well defined (Humphries et al., 2004; Hynes, 2002) . In invertebrate, integrins were also reported to be responsible for cellular adhesive processes correlated with several immune responses, such as degranulation (Johansson and S\u00f6derh\u00e4ll, 1989) , phagocytosis (Mamali et al., 2009; Terahara et al., 2006) and encapsulation (Levin et al., 2005) . However, in comparison with mammalian, the role of invertebrate integrins in the innate immune system has not been well studied yet.",

The ClustalW Multiple Alignment program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) was used to create the multiple sequence alignment. An unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the sequences alignment by the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm using the Mega3.1 program. The reliability of the branching was tested by using bootstrap re-sampling (1000 pseudo-replicates).",

The first-strand synthesis was carried out based on M-MLV RTase instuctions (Takara) using the DNase-treated total RNA as template. Two \u03b2 integrin specific primers InteF3 and InteR3 (Table 1) were used to amplify a product of 650 bp, while a pair of \u03b2-actin primers, AF and AR (Table 1) were used to amplify 11,284 bp fragment as an internal control. The PCR reactions were performed at 94\u00b0C for min, and followed by 30 cycles (for Fc\u03b2Int) or 25 cycles (for actin) of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 57\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 60 s and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min.

In the INB domain, there is an I-like domain (also called \u03b2A domain) (amino acids # 132-361), which is a member of the type A domain superfamily containing a prototype molecule called von Willebrand factor (vWF) (Figs. 1 and  2) . Proteins with vWF domain participate in numerous biological events, and interact with a large array of ligands (Colombatti et al., 1993) . A metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) (amino acids # 141-145) with a DXSXS motif, which has been suggested as the ligand-binding site, is found in the \u03b2A domain of Fc\u03b2Int (Figs. 1 and  2) . A PSI (plexin-semaphorin-integrin) domain (amino acids # 26-77) is also found in the INB domain (Figs. 1 and 2) . The remainder of the extracellular portion of the Fc\u03b2Int between the \u03b2A domain and the membrane-spanning region contains four cysteine-rich, epidermal-growth-factor (EGF)-like domains. In the cytoplasmic domain, two NPX(Y/F) motifs (amino acids # 813-816 and 825-828) are identified, which are highly conserved in \u03b2-integrins of invertebrates, and are suggested to have an important role in activating integrins via inducing conformational changes (Figs. 1 and 2) . A membrane-proximal sequences (LLv-iHDR motif) was also found, which play an important role in affinity modulation of integrins (Hughes and Pfaff, 1998) . Altogether, these results suggest that Fc\u03b2Int has similar domain structures as those in integrin \u03b2 subunits of other invertebrate.",

Structural analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed that Fc\u03b2Int has similar domains and motifs to the other \u03b2 subunits from invertebrates, including a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, an \u03b2A domain, four epidermalgrowth-factor (EGF)-like domains and two NPX(Y/F) motifs (Fig. 1 ) (Lavine and Strand, 2003; Levin et al., 2005) . \u03b2A domain contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), which may activate integrin for cell adhesion and migration during the encapsulation process (Colombatti et al., 1993) .",

In present study, RT-PCR analysis showed that the Fc\u03b2Int mRNA was expressed in various tissues, but at different levels. The strongest expression was observed in the hemocytes, whereas, the lowest expression was seen in the muscle and hepatopancreas.

IFA confirmed that the antibodies could react with the membrane of hemocytes. Western blotting assay showed that the polyclonal antibodies could react strongly with a 120 kDa protein and weakly reacted with a 55 kDa protein in hemocytes. It's well known that the basic structure of integrins is a heterodimeric complex of one 130-200 kDa \u03b1 subunit linked noncovalently to one 90-130 kDa \u03b2 subunit, so the 120 kDa was probably the native Fc\u03b2Int in shrimp hemocytes (Ruoslahti and Pierschbacher, 1987) . However, the apparent mass of the 120 kDa protein was larger than the calculated mass of Fc\u03b2Int (86.8 kDa), which might be due to posttranslational modifications of Fc\u03b2Int, because deduced amino acid sequence of Fc\u03b2Int contains 3 N-glycosylation sites, 1 O-glycosylation site and 44 phosphorylation sites by bioinformation analysis. Similarly, a \u03b2 subunit of hemocytes integrin from crayfish has been cloned with a theoretical MW of 88.4 kDa, and the corresponding polypeptide of about 110 kDa was identified in hemocytes membranes by immunoblot (Holmblad Fig. 7 . Characterization of polyclonal antibodies against rFc\u03b2Int-ER by IFA and western blotting.

In insect, \u03b21 subunit from hemocytes of O. furnacalis was cloned with a theoretical MW of 88.7 kDa, and the corresponding polypeptide of about 120 kDa has also been identified in hemocytes (Hu et al., 2010) . So, it is likely that the cloned Fc\u03b2Int indeed corresponds to the 120 kDa protein in hemocytes recognized by the antibodies.",

Since the extracellular domains of many integrins have the ability to bind to the RGD motif (Stewart and Nemerow, 2007) , Fc\u03b2Int-ER was recombinantly expressed in E. coli BL21 in present study, which exhibited specific WSSV binding activity in vitro by ELISA and dot-blot binding assays and could partially block WSSV infection to freshwater crayfish in vivo in neutralization assay. The neutralization of Fc\u03b2Int-ER significantly, but incompletely, blocked the WSSV infection, suggesting that other receptors for WSSV may be present. Consistently, previous study also showed that a \u03b2 integrin of M. japonicus could block the WSSV infection in vivo and in vitro (Li et al., 2007a) .

Dengue virus serotype 2 infection could also induce up-regulating expression of \u03b23 integrin in human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line-1, which was required for virus entry (Zhang et al., 2007) . Consistently, expression of Fc\u03b2Int was up-regulated in shrimp gill after WSSV infection, and reached about 4.5 times of that in the uninfected shrimp. In addition, it is noteworthy that strong inhibitory effects on WSSV infection could be achieved by down-regulation expression of \u03b2 integrin in M. japonicus (Li et al., 2007a) . It has also been reported that hemocytes of shrimp was one of the important target cells for WSSV (Wang et al., 2002; Zhan et al., 1999) . Taken together, it is interesting to speculate that up-regulation expression of Fc\u03b2Int acted as a potential receptor might facilitate WSSV entry and infection.",

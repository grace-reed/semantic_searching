As a product of both sewage and algal-derived exudates, elevated labile DOC availability in polluted and/or algal-dominated reefs can have a multifaceted and negative impact on coral health. Labile DOC is highly enriched in easily degradable monosaccharides (i.e. glucose, galactose, mannose, and xylose) which stimulate bacterial growth, particularly that of copiotrophic bacteria and opportunistic pathogens (Nelson et al., 2013) . This microbialization of the coral reef can increase the potential for coral disease by enhancing localized hypoxia, virulence factors, accumulation of poisons (e.g. hydrogen sulphide or secondary metabolites) and pathogenicity (C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2018; Haas et al., 2016 Haas et al., , 2011 Kline et al., 2006; Kuntz et al., 2005; Nelson et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2006) . Subsequent coral die-off related to disease creates space for further algal growth, thereby inducing a positive feedback loop summarized in the DDAM (Disease, Dissolved organic carbon, Algae, Microbes) model (Barott and Rohwer, 2012) . A recent study (Pogoreutz et al., 2017) however showed that individual colonies of Pocillopora damicornis displayed severe bleaching in response to elevated levels of DOC despite a stable coral microbiome and the absence of pathogens, suggesting that there might be bacterial-independent effects of DOC on corals.",

Exogenous DOC (i.e. sugars) decreases the expression of photosynthetic genes and represses photosynthesis in terrestrial plants (Moore et al., 2003; Pourtau, Jennings, Pelzer, Pallas, & Wingler, 2006; Wingler, Mar\u00e8s, & Pourtau, 2004) . Also, free-living cells of the genus Symbiodinium experienced a dramatically reduced photosynthetic capacity when grown on DOCsupplemented medium (Xiang et al., 2018) . It was suggested that these photosynthetically incompetent free-living algae are also less likely to establish a symbiosis with a coral host (Hagedorn et al., 2015) , but whether labile DOC compounds also have the potential to impair the photosynthetic functioning of the algae in hospite and de-stabilize the coral symbiosis has not been investigated yet.",

While photosynthesis in nitrogen-limited plants is DOC repressed, there is no loss in photosynthetic activity when the growth medium was additionally supplied with nitrogen (Lobo et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2003; Paul and Driscoll, 1997) . On the contrary to plants, it was suggested that coral bleaching upon DOC enrichment is induced via the increased supply of ammonium from J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f coral-associated N2 fixing bacteria (Pogoreutz et al., 2017) . It was hypothesized that this increased ammonium availability caused the breakdown of the coral symbiosis by inducing an imbalanced nitrogen:phosphorus ratio of the symbionts (Wiedenmann et al., 2013) . Such symbiosis disruption is however not observed with ammonium enrichment alone, which also proved to be very beneficial in avoiding coral bleaching during thermal stress (B\u00e9raud et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2017) . All together, these observations suggest that the role of nitrogen supply during DOC-induced bleaching deserves more attention, both at the symbiont and host level. Whether DOC enrichment induces bleaching by repressing symbiont photosynthesis and/or by replacing the carbon provided by symbiont photosynthates, and whether nitrogen supplementation can mitigate DOC-induced photosynthesis repression remains to be investigated.",

Ambient nutrient concentrations were ~0.1 mM DOC and ~0.2 \u03bcM ammonium, and were manipulated to final concentrations of 1.0 mM DOC and 4.0 \u03bcM ammonium in the enriched tanks by daily additions of a saccharide mixture (19.5% (D+) Galactose, 22.5% (D+) Glucose, 24.5% (D+) Mannose and 33.5% (D+) Xylose) and an ammonium chloride solution (NH4Cl). The % contribution of each saccharide represents the neutral monosaccharide composition of sewage and coral reef macroalgae exudates (Huang et al., 2010; Nelson et al., 2013) . Natural DOC concentrations on coral reefs range on average from 30 to 80 \u03bcM (Haas et al., 2016) , while on some reefs pulses of extremely high organic carbon concentrations (>300 \u03bcM) have been sporadically (less than 3% of annual measurements) observed (Baker et al., 2007) . The present study followed a mechanistic approach to investigate the effects of DOC enrichment on the coral symbiosis under low and high ammonium availability; in order to compare our results directly with those of Pogoreutz et al. (2017) we applied the same DOC concentrations that were three-fold higher as observed for some reef sites during high organic carbon pulses (Baker et al., 2007) . An enriched ammonium concentration of 4 \u03bcM was chosen as it is known to cause significantly increased ammonium uptake rates (120-510 ng N cm -2 h -1 ) in S. pistillata as compared to uptake rates (2-30 ng N cm -2 h -1 ) at 0.2 \u03bcM ammonium (Grover et al., 2002) . DOC and ammonium concentrations were monitored once a week in all tanks using an autoanalyser (Alliance Instrument, AMS, France) and TOC analyser (Shimadzu TOC-VCPH; CV maximum \u22641.5 %, i.e. \u00b1 1 \u03bcmol C L (Table S1 ). Corals were kept under these four treatment conditions for a total period of 6 weeks (treatment period), followed by a recovery period over 3 weeks in which all tanks were supplied with seawater containing ambient DOC and ammonium concentrations. Before the start of the experiment, DOC (i.e. glucose) assimilation into host tissue and Symbiodiniaceae was tested and quantified on eight extra Control corals using the tracer 13 C-Glucose. During the experiment, a specific number of coral nubbins was sampled from each tank during week 3 and 6 (treatment period) as well as during week 9 (recovery period) for the following measurements: 1) Symbiodiniaceae specific parameters (the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II (PSII), photosynthesis rates, Symbiodiniaceae density and Chl a content); 2) host energy reserves (protein, carbohydrate and lipid content); 3) lipid peroxidation (LPO) as a proxy for ROS production; 4) stoichiometric nutrient ratios (C:N:P) of Symbiodiniaceae and host; 5) activity of N2 fixing microbes (assimilation of diazotrophderived nitrogen by host and symbionts).",

Coral tissue was removed from the skeleton using an water-pick and separated in several centrifugation steps into animal and algal fraction (Grover et al., 2002) . Each fraction was freeze-dried before the 13 C enrichment together with the organic carbon content was quantified using a mass spectrometer (Delta Plus, Thermofisher Scientific, Germany) coupled via a ConFlo III interface to a C/N analyzer (Flash EA, Thermofisher Scientific). The atom % 13 C excess enrichment resulting from glucose assimilation was calculated by subtracting the natural 13 C enrichment obtained from control corals and considered significant when it was at least three times higher as the standard deviation of control samples.

Two nubbins per tank (n=4 per treatment and time point) were incubated under constant stirring in a thermally regulated 50 ml beaker completely filled with 0.45 \u03bcm filtered seawater. Oxygen fluxes were monitored over 60 min (in 1 min intervals) in the dark (R rates) and at 200 \u03bcmol quanta m -2 s -1 (Pn rates), respectively, using Unisense optodes connected to a computer with OXY-4 software (Chanel fiber-optic oxygen meter, PreSens, Germany). Optodes were calibrated against N2-saturated and air-saturated seawater for 0% and 100% oxygen saturation, respectively. P n and R rates were calculated by regressing oxygen data against time and normalizing the rates to both, incubation volume and skeletal surface area (cm 2 ) of the coral fragment. Skeletal surface area of the coral fragments was determined using the single wax-dipping technique (Veal et al., 2010) . Gross photosynthesis (Pg) was subsequently calculated according to Pg = Pn -R. Additionally, Pg was converted into carbon equivalent (Pc) in order to compare the carbon input from 13 C-Glucose uptake with that from photosynthesis. The daily carbon input from Pc and glucose uptake was calculated using a 12h (i.e. light period) and 24h period, respectively. Since the heterotrophic uptake of glucose is supposed to be primarily assimilated by the host rather than the Symbiodiniaceae, we calculated the individual amount of photosynthesis-derived carbon available to the host (Pchost) and symbionts (Pcsymbiont) assuming that ca. 80% of total Pc is translocated to the host and 20% is kept by symbionts (Tremblay et al., 2014) .",

The calculated Pchost of Control corals was 97\u00b111 \u03bcg C cm -2 d -1 (during week 3) indicating that glucose assimilation by the host can provide an additional 10% of carbon to the host's total carbon budget.

Here, we observed a ~50% Symbiodiniaceae loss after 3 weeks of DOC enrichment, while no difference in the amount of LPO was detected between DOC-treated and Control corals.

These Symbiodinium cells recovered their PSII activity once returned to medium without sugar supply (Xiang et al., 2018) , similar to the observations of our corals during the recovery period. These findings show that Symbiodinium cells can switch its carbon metabolism from photoautotrophic nutrition to mixotrophic or heterotrophic nutrition when supplied with glucose. While changes in the carbon metabolism, particularly the loss of photosynthetic activity, in response to DOC enrichment may not affect the survival of freeliving Symbiodinium cells, it may have severe implications to establish and/or maintain a symbiotic association with a cnidarian host. Indeed, a reduced capacity to populate and establish a symbiosis with a cnidarian host was observed for free-living Symbiodinium cells that previously lost their photosynthetic activity in response to exogenous glucose (Hagedorn et al., 2015; Xiang et al., 2018) . This was likely driven by the absence of photosynthesisderived carbon (i.e. trehalose), that serves as chemoattractant for coral larvae indicating that the algae are photosynthetically competent (Hagedorn et al., 2015) . Similarly, in an established and intact coral symbiosis, Symbiodiniaceae likely signal their photosynthetic competency by constantly translocating photosynthates to the host. As suggested in the arrested phagosome hypothesis the symbiosome may mimick a prey digesting phagosome via constant photosynthate translocation that allows residence within the intracellular host cell habitat (Hill and Hill, 2012); on the contrary, when photosynthate translocation drops below host cellular expectations, symbionts may be detected by the host followed by digestion/exocytosis via phago-lysosome fusion (Hill and Hill, 2012) . Besides a loss of photosynthetic activity, changes in the cell-surface morphology and thylakoid fragmentation have also been observed on Symbiodinium cells grown on elevated external sugar levels (Xiang et al., 2018) . The surface structure of Symbiodinium cells can be critical for interactions with a cnidarian host as surface differences of glucose-grown cells reduced host infection of Aiptasia larvae (Xiang et al., 2018) . Also, thylakoid breakdown can trigger the autophagic-associated machinery of host cells resulting in digestion/exocytosis of symbionts (Downs et al., 2009) . ",

All Symbiodiniaceae-related parameters in DOC+N treated corals remained stable for an extended period, and only declined after 6 weeks of treatment. Since photosynthetic parameters in corals only supplemented with additional ammonium (i.e. N treatment) were stable throughout the entire experiment, we can rule out that corals were negatively impacted by ammonium enrichment itself. Overall, the data demonstrate that ammonium supply can effectively mitigate the negative effects of DOC enrichment on the maintenance of the coral symbiosis for a limited period of time. Similar effects have been observed on higher plants where additional nitrogen supplementation diminished the negative effects of exogenous sugars by helping the plant to maintain photosynthetic gene expression, RuBisCo activity, pigmentation and overall photosynthetic activity (Martin et al., 2002; Paul and Driscoll, 1997) . Similarly to higher plants, ammonium enrichment was demonstrated to cause early transcriptional changes in a reef-building coral including an up-regulation in the expression of RuBisCo and Chl a-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f binding protein genes (Rosic et al., 2014) . Also, in thermally stressed corals ammonium stimulates the production of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments, thereby maintaining the photophysiological capacity and preventing bleaching of corals (B\u00e9raud et al., 2013 ). Since ammonium can decrease the susceptibility of corals to temperature-induced bleaching, similar mechanisms may explain the beneficial role of ammonium in mitigating DOC-induced bleaching.",

Pogoreutz et al. (2017) measured increased N:P ratios in Symbiodiniaceae of DOC-treated corals. The bleaching susceptibility of corals is known to increase during an imbalanced N:P supply. However, bleaching upon N enrichment is in this case explained by rather extremely low P than surplus N availabilities (Wiedenmann et al., 2013) . In our study, P availability was possibly sufficient (~0.2 \u03bcM) throughout the experiment as no bleaching occurred in the treatment only supplied with N. Also, stable nutrient stoichiometries (C:N and N:P ratios) among all treatments suggest that an N:P imbalance was likely not the main driver for DOCinduced bleaching. Overall, our study indicates that N enrichment enables Symbiodiniaceae cells to maintain their photosynthetic competency over a longer period, which may explain why symbiont expulsion was significantly delayed in the DOC+N as compared to the DOC treatment.",

                "text": "Although we showed that DOC enrichment has detrimental effects on the photosynthetic capacity of coral symbionts and the maintenance of the coral-algae association, DOC may instead benefit the heterotrophic coral host metabolism by serving as alternative carbon J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f source. Coral host cells more heavily rely on their stored energy reserves when carbon translocation from symbionts is reduced under bleached conditions. This energy is primarily obtained through ATP utilization, followed by the depletion of available glucose reserves, and finally through the activation of lipid hydrolysis. Depletion of total lipids is a well-established phenomenon in corals starting within a few days after the onset of bleaching (Anthony et al., 2009; Imbs and Yakovleva, 2012; Rodrigues and Grottoli, 2007) . The use of lipid reserves by the host can vary in accordance with the coral colony morphology (Yamashiro et al., 2005) , the size of initial lipid stores (Anthony et al., 2009) and the heterotrophic capacity of the coral host (Grottoli et al., 2006) . Moreover, it may also depend on the availability of alternative carbon sources such as DOC in the surrounding seawater. Our results show that DOC-treated corals maintained their total lipid content and even increased their carbohydrate content despite 50% symbiont loss. We demonstrate using 13 C-glucose that corals assimilate DOC from the seawater primarily into the host tissue, which can account in Control corals for 10% of the host's carbon supply derived from photosynthesis (Pchost). This amount of glucose uptake can become more important for the total carbon budget of the host, when Pchost is reduced by 75% in DOC-treated corals. The uptake and metabolic utilization of exogenous DOC can thus help corals to partially replace the reduced autotrophic carbon input and to conserve their carbon reserves during bleaching. Also previous studies have shown that DOC can be a source for some coral species to maintain their carbon budgets when bleached in response to elevated sea surface temperature (Levas et al., 2016 (Levas et al., , 2013 . However, heterotrophic uptake of DOC in repeatedly bleached corals failed to mitigate carbon budget deficits of the host likely due to a lack of heterotrophic plasticity (Levas et al., 2016) .",

Assuming similar DOC assimilation rates between these two treatments, different carbohydrate contents may be explained by differences in the metabolic activities of corals. Indeed, DOC-treated corals had lower respiration rates compared to DOC+N treated corals, indicating a reduced metabolic activity that possibly allows bleached DOC-treated colonies to better conserve energy reserves. Although no depletion in carbon reserves (i.e. lipids, carbohydrates) was observed in bleached DOC-treated corals, the protein content significantly decreased indicating that the host catabolizes its own nitrogen reserves. In contrast, the corals' nitrogen reserves (i.e. protein) remained stable when exposed to DOC+N. Overall, our results suggest that bleached corals may rely on external DOC for a limited period of time, whereas the provision of additional nitrogen will be essential to avoid long-term depletion of nitrogen reserves within J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the host tissue. Lastly, it should be noted that the present study followed a mechanistic approach by investigating the effects of relatively high DOC and ammonium concentrations on the coral symbiosis. Although our study alerts on the potential risk of high DOC levels for coral physiology, further studies will be needed to determine the effects under environmentally relevant DOC conditions as well as under chronic DOC exposure over longer time periods.",

In addition to this microbial-mediated DOC effect on corals, the present study demonstrates that DOC pollution can also directly impair the photosynthetic functioning of Symbiodiniaceae in hospite thereby de-stabilizing the maintenance of the coral symbiosis. Although DOC may serve as alternative carbon source for the host when the availability of photosynthesis-derived carbon is reduced, we show that other key nutrients (i.e. nitrogen) are particularly essential to maintain coral symbionts in a photosynthetically competent state, to conserve the host's energy reserves and subsequently to delay DOC-induced bleaching.",

This can help minimize environmental impacts associated with the global challenge of climate change.",

Overall, the reduced photosynthetic activity accompanied with a potentially modified membrane structure of symbionts upon DOC enrichment may have possibly induced symbiont expulsion as observed here.

Shuttleworth, 1988; Karnaky, 1998 . Research on a limited number of marine elasmobranchs has shown that the extracellular fluids are generally maintained slightly hyperosmotic to the surround-\u017d ing medium Smith, 1929; Holmes and Donald-. son, 1969; Shuttleworth, 1988 .

While sharks and rays are predominately marine, many elasmobranch species possess the osmoregulatory capacity for tolerating moderate to substantial reductions in environmental salinity \u017d .

Cooper and Morris, 1998 . Furthermore, several of these studies reported disproportionate changes in the concentrations of plasma electrolytes and nitrogenous compounds, suggesting individual regulation of the extracellular solutes associated with environmental dilution. Unfortunately, few of these dilution investigations considered the corresponding responses of the intracellular com-\u017d partment Forster and Goldstein, 1976; Chan and .

Yanez- Arancibia, 1979 . The objectives of the present investigation were to determine the effects of stepwise environmental dilution on body fluid regulation in U. jamaicensis. More specifically, this study sought to characterize the water and solute composition for plasma and a single \u017d . intracellular compartment erythrocytes as a function of environmental salinity. Our hypothesis was that the ionic osmolytes of both fluid compartments would be conserved at the expense of urea as external salinity decreased.",

Moreover, \u017d . Carlson and Goldstein 1997 identified the specific avenue for urea exchange in the little skate erythrocyte as the lipid membrane rather than aqueous channelsrpores. Given sufficient time andror membrane permeability, passive diffusion would dissipate transient urea gradients. There is increasing evidence that membrane permeability to urea may be lower than previously thought \u017d . Walsh et al., 1994; Carlson and Goldstein, 1997 . However, the measured or estimated rates of urea transport across elasmobranch red cells appear sufficient for the rapid equalization of this organic solute following osmotic perturbations \u017dRabinowitz and Gunther, 1973; Kaplan et al., 1974; Walsh et al., 1994; Carlson and Goldstein, . 1997 .",

Therefore, within the salinity range that this animal \u017d normally inhabits 81\u1390 100% SW; Yanez-. Arancibia, 1979 , the yellow stingray regulates its extracellular fluid concentration in hypo-osmotic environments through comparable reductions of each of the three major plasma solutes. In the \u017d . most dilute medium 66% SW , further losses of the two primary electrolytes were curtailed. In fact, plasma concentrations of Na and Cl were reduced only 17% and 15%, respectively, below control levels. The animal's lower limit of tolerance for extracellular ionic dilution may occur within this concentration range. Solute compensation for the transition from 74% to 66% SW was, therefore, achieved largely by further and substantial reductions of extracellular urea. In 66% w x SW, the plasma urea of acclimated stingrays was reduced by 59% below control levels. Similar findings have been reported for other dilutiontolerant sharks and rays. Table 5 shows that for several marine elasmobranchs acclimated in media ranging from 77% to 26% SW, the measured w x declines in plasma urea were greater, and in some cases two times greater, than those exhibw x w x ited by Na andror Cl .",

In addition, under unperturbed conditions, proteolytic systems have been shown to be relevant for the removal of dysfunctional, unassembled, or mistargeted mitochondrial proteins (Mohanraj et al., 2019; Quir\u00f3 s et al., 2015) . Furthermore, cells can employ protein turnover as regulatory mechanisms, for example in the mitophagy-controlling PINK1-Parkin system (Fang et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2010; Lazarou et al., 2015; Sekine et al., 2019) . However, the extent to which protein turnover is important for regulating protein abundance under unperturbed, steady-state conditions is much less clear. Particularly, little is known about the degradation of mitochondrial proteins that have already reached a functional state. Many proteome-wide studies were based on GFP fusion proteins, which makes the data unreliable and difficult to interpret, because the fused GFP moiety compromises the sorting and functionality of many proteins (Belle et al., 2006; Weill et al., 2018; Yen et al., 2008) . We therefore aimed to identify mitochondrial proteins with high turnover rates by using a minimally invasive pulse-labeling approach based on stable isotopelabeled amino acids and mass spectrometry (Doherty et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014) .",

Variations in the labeling strategy allow the adaptation of this well-established proteomics methodology to address specialized questions. We employed a dynamic SILAC procedure to screen for mitochondrial proteins with exceptionally high turnover rates. Yeast cells were grown in medium with ''light'' amino acid isotopes, reisolated, and switched to ''heavy'' [ 13 C 6 / 15 N 4 ] arginine and [ 13 C 6 / 15 N 2 ] lysine-containing medium. At different time points, aliquots were taken from this logarithmically growing culture, mitochondria were isolated, and proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry ( Figure 1A ). Over time, heavy peptides replaced the light ones, thereby allowing us to rank mitochondrial proteins according to their relative turnover rates. In total, we detected 290 mitochondrial proteins, of which 148 were quantified in at least 4 of the 7 time points. The incorporation rates of heavy amino acids showed a very narrow distribution across the analyzed proteins ( Figures 1B-1D ). After approximately one and two doubling times, the percentage of heavy (A) Schematic representation of the dynamic SILAC labeling approach. (B) Peptides with heavy amino acids increase over time. The heavy-to-total ratios for all detected peptides were plotted for different time points after switching to the heavy medium.

(C) The fractions of heavy peptides for each mitochondrial protein were plotted over time. Nde1 and Qcr10 showed a much higher turnover than any other mitochondrial protein.

This indicates that the high turnover rate is not simply an unavoidable consequence of an intricate or unstable structure ( Figures 1C and 1D ). Nde1, Nde2, and Ndi1 are all NADH dehydrogenases that transfer electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. They are functional equivalents of complex I of the respiratory chain, although they do not pump protons. Nde1 and Nde2 contain stop-anchor sequences and are tethered via N-terminal transmembrane domains to the intermembrane space (IMS) side of the inner membrane, while Ndi1 faces the matrix side ( Figure 2A ). They are, at least in part, functionally redundant, because all the single deletion mutants Dnde1, Dnde2, and Dndi1, are able to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources ( Figure 2B ). Mitochondria isolated from these strains can also still use NADH as a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation, as determined by in vitro oxygen consumption assays ( Figure 2C ).

We therefore asked whether there might be a second role of Nde1, which requires its rapid turnover. To test for the consequences of increased Nde1 levels, we replaced the endogenous genomic Nde1 promoter with a strong regulatable GAL10 promoter. Using an Nde1-specific antibody, we confirmed the overexpression of Nde1 in this strain upon growth in the presence of galactose ( Figure S1A ), and this Nde1 overexpression was accompanied with a strongly reduced cell number (Figures 2D and 2E) . Surprisingly, the toxic phenotype was independent of the NADH dehydrogenase function, because the overexpression of Nde1 containing mutations in the NADH binding pocket in the Rossmann fold (Scrutton et al., 1990 ) still prevented cell growth ( Figures 2F, 2G , S1B-S1E). This toxicity was also independent of respiration, because it was also observed in cells grown anaerobically ( Figure 2F ). In summary, we conclude that Nde1 exhibits two distinct functions, one as an electron transfer enzyme in the respiratory chain and one that is detrimental for yeast cell viability. The high turnover of Nde1 is apparently related to the latter function. The indicated strains were grown to log phase in glucose medium. Ten-fold serial dilutions were dropped on the plates that contained the indicated carbon sources. (C) 100 mg of mitochondria isolated from indicated strains were incubated in a Clark electrode and oxygen consumption was measured after addition of 7 mM NADH.

(E) The indicated strains were precultured on glucose medium before their growth was analyzed. (F) Nde1 wild-type or mutant versions were expressed from a GAL promoter in wild-type cells. Growth was analyzed in the presence or absence of oxygen. (G) Oxygen consumption after NADH addition was measured with mitochondria isolated from the indicated strains. The residual dehydrogenase activity in the Dnde1 mitochondria is due to the presence of Nde2 in these strains. Means and SDs from n = 4 independent technical replicates are shown.",

As shown in Figure 3D , the cytosol exposed, mitochondrial outer membrane protein, Om14, was efficiently recovered with the streptavidin beads whereas proteins of the IMS, the inner membrane, and the matrix, were not. However, consistent with our protease assays, we observed that a considerable fraction of Nde1 was biotinylated, indicating that this species of Nde1 was accessible to the cytosol. Taken together, these results demonstrate that endogenous Nde1 has two distinct topomers ( Figure 3E ). In addition to the IMSlocated Nde1, there is a cytosol-exposed Nde1 fraction that appears to span both membranes. Both Nde1 topomers are processed by the matrix processing peptidase, thus we propose that the cytosol-exposed topomer remains associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, we cannot formally exclude that after its processing by the matrix processing peptidase, a fraction of Nde1 slides back and is inserted into the outer membrane in a mode similar to that which was recently described for Om45 (Song et al., 2014; Wenz et al., 2014) . It seems likely that only the IMS-located Nde1 is enzymatically active and able to transfer electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which resides in the inner membrane. The cytosol-exposed .

It is possible that folding of the C-terminal region in the precursor can counteract full translocation, a mechanism that was shown before to cause dual localization of the mitochondrial protein fumarase (Knox et al., 1998) . We observed that biogenesis of the fully protease-protected Nde1 species required a strong mitochondrial membrane potential ( Figure 4B ). When we added low amounts of the membrane uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP) to the import reaction, Nde1 did not reach a protease-resistant conformation.

Interestingly, the Mia40-Nde1 protein still showed the same dual topology as Nde1 and was catalytically active, however, it was not toxic. In contrast, the Tom70-Nde1 protein was toxic but was unable to pass electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain ( Figures 4E and 4F ). Apparently, toxicity of Nde1 overexpression coincided with the generation of the 40 kDa fragment. This fragment was even formed when Nde1 was fused to the matrix-targeting cytochrome b D19 presequence, potentially owing to a translational arrest of a fraction of the protein ( Figures S3E and S3F ). Expression of the C-terminal NADH dehydrogenase domain of Nde1 without any mitochondrial targeting sequence was not toxic, because it was very rapidly degraded ( Figures S3E and S3F ). In line with this observation, C-terminal truncation of Nde1 annihilated its toxicity and resulted in a corresponding shortening of the fragment. In particular, the region between amino acids 430 and 500 seems to be crucial for toxicity (Figures S3G and S3H) .",

We also observed that in whole cell extracts, but not in isolated mitochondria, several Nde1-derived fragments are detected (Figure 5A ), suggesting that the cytosol-exposed topomer is preferentially degraded. Several recent studies have identified two major proteolytic systems that control the levels of IMS and outer membrane proteins, namely the Cdc48/proteasome system in the cytosol and the i-AAA protease Yme1 in the IMS (Jin et al., 2010; Kowalski et al., 2018; Leonhard et al., 1996; M\u00e5 rtensson et al., 2019; Rampello and Glynn, 2017; Steffen et al., 2017; V\u00f6 gtle et al., 2011; Wrobel et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2011; Z\u00f6 ller et al., 2018) . We employed a stability assay in which we monitored cellular Nde1 levels after inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide ( Figure 5B ). This assay confirmed the proteolytic instability of Nde1. However, Nde1 was markedly stabilized when the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added. In temperature-sensitive cdc48-2 cells, Nde1 was stabilized and Nde1-derived fragments accumulated, in particular at the restrictive temperature of 37 C ( Figures 5C, S4A , and S4B). Obviously, Cdc48 facilitates the degradation of the characteristic Nde1 fragment (f cyto , Figures 5C and S4B ). Expression of non-toxic Mia40-Nde1 fusion in the cdc48-2 strain did not lead to the accumulation of this fragment ( Figure 5D ). This fragment was present in cytosolic fractions and could be largely separated from mitochondria on sucrose gradients ( Figure 5E ). We conclude that the generation of a specific C-terminal fragment and its release from the mitochondria is responsible for the toxicity of Nde1.",

We reasoned that strains lacking components that favor the production of the toxic Nde1 fragment should show an increased resistance to Nde1 overexpression. Intriguingly, we found that mutants that affect the function of the proteasome are particularly resistant against Nde1-mediated toxicity. Moreover, many components of the mitochondrial import machinery were found to be critical for Nde1-mediated toxicity, particularly those of the import motor and the TIM22 complex ( Figure S5 ; Table S1). On the contrary, the deletion of the Cdc48 adaptor Doa1 that was previously shown to be relevant for degradation of mitochondrial proteins (Wu et al., 2016) did not provide resistance but rather strongly increased the levels of the toxic Nde1 fragment (Figures 5F and 5G). In cells lacking the mitochondrial i-AAA protease Yme1, an additional fragment accumulated that presumably represents the mitochondrial stub of the processed Nde1 ( Figures 5H and 5I ). Thus, mitochondrial (Yme1) and cytosolic (proteasome/Cdc48/Doa1) proteases cooperate in the degradation of the cytosol-exposed Nde1 topomer.",

We ruled out a respiration-related cause, because this topomer of Nde1 cannot transfer electrons to ubiquinone, and as observed earlier, both the wild-type version and catalytically inactive mutants of Nde1 are toxic upon overexpression. Nde1 belongs to a family of NADH dehydrogenases ( Figure 6A ; Table S2 ), which also includes the evolutionary conserved apoptosis inducing factor 1, Aif1 (Wissing et al., 2004) . Homologs of Aif1 are present in animals and humans, where they were reported to play an ill-defined role in apoptosis (Hangen et al., 2015; Joza et al., 2009; Susin et al., 1999) . In order to test whether Nde1 participates in programmed cell death, we treated wild-type and Dnde1 cells with the apoptosis-inducing reagents acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (Ludovico et al., 2001; Madeo et al., 1999) for 3 h before we washed the cells and tested how many cells had survived the treatment ( Figures 6B and 6C ). While most of the Nde1-containing cells were dead after this treatment, the absence of Nde1 made cells largely insensitive to these apoptotic stimuli. Overexpression of Nde1, on the other hand, rendered cells even more susceptible to both chemical stressors ( Figures 6C, 6D , S6A, and S6B).",

Upon acetic acid treatment, Dnde1 cultures have considerably lower fractions of propidium iodide (PI)-positive cells (Figure 6E) , which confirms the insensitivity to this apoptotic stimulus. Subsequent annexin V/PI co-staining revealed that most of the PI-positive cells are also annexin V-positive and therefore late apoptotic cells (Carmona-Gutierrez et al., 2018; Madeo et al., 1997) . Thus, the presence of Nde1 is obviously involved in the induction of apoptosis in these cultures (Figures 6F and S6C) that coincides with oxidative stress in these cells ( Figure S6D ).",

Because we saw that its topology is influenced by membrane potential, we hypothesized that the energetic status of mitochondria might be of relevance for the propensity of Nde1 to act as an apoptotic factor. Indeed, upon Nde1 overexpression, we observed a strong accumulation of the cytosolic Nde1-derived fragment in cells that are unable to respire (f cyto , Figure 7A ). This fragment was not observed in wild-type cells, presumably owing to the more efficient Nde1 translocation across the outer membrane in healthy cells. In line with this, respiration-deficient cells, lacking the respiratory chain component Cox4, were more susceptible to mild apoptotic stimulation with acetic acid than wild-type cells. This phenotype, however, required the presence of Nde1 ( Figures 7B and S7A ). Furthermore, mutants of respiratory chain subunits were found much less frequently among the survivors in our screen for Nde1-resistant strains than expected by random sampling ( Figure S5 ). This suggests that Nde1-mediated apoptosis is used to counterselect against respiration-deficient cells. In fact, we observed an increased number of respiration-deficient (petite) colonies in glucose-grown Dnde1 cultures ( Figure 7C ), which were unable to grow on glycerol-containing medium ( Figure S7B ). These petite colonies characterize cells that harbor no or a non-functional mitochondrial genome (collectively termed rho 0 ) ( Figures 7D,  S7C , and S7D). Accordingly, when we incubated rho 0 mitochon-dria with radiolabeled Nde1 precursor, only very low amounts of Nde1 were completely translocated across the outer membrane, and most Nde1 accumulated in the surface-exposed topomer that was converted into the f N20 fragment upon protease addition (f N20 , Figure S7E) . In summary, we conclude that respirationdeficient mitochondria accumulate the cytosol-exposed Nde1 species that primes these cells to undergo apoptosis.",

Hence, the functional state of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and of the major protein quality control systems together determine the intracellular distribution and hence the apoptotic potential of Nde1. Thereby, Nde1 appears to be part of a mechanism that continuously monitors the cellular state of both metabolism and proteostasis ( Figure 7E ). The pro-apoptotic potential of Nde1 is particularly pronounced upon metabolic stress conditions such as during temporary exposure to acetic acid or hydrogen peroxide. In this context, Nde1 serves as an essential mediator in metabolic signaling on the mitochondrial surface that has the potential to trigger programmed cell death. How cell death is executed by Nde1 is not known, but we observed a characteristic cytosolic fragment upon pro-apoptotic stimuli. Earlier studies reported that Nde1 can release deleterious amounts of hydrogen peroxide (Gomes et al., 2013) that might partly explain its toxic potential. However, we also observed toxicity for Nde1 mutants with much lower oxidoreductase activity and during anaerobic growth where hydrogen peroxide production seems unlikely. Unbiased genetic screening already identified the proteasome and the mitochondrial import motor as critical for the toxicity of Nde1. Hence, our results lay the basis for systematic investigations, employing the power of yeast genetics to characterize the downstream pathway of Nde1-mediated apoptosis.",

                "text": "Nde1 is a homolog of the mammalian AIF (Susin et al., 1999) . How comparable is Nde1-mediated apoptosis with the cell death program executed by AIF? There are actually many obvious similarities: (1) AIF and Nde1 can both function as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases (Elguindy and Nakamaru-Ogiso, 2015); (2) AIF and Nde1 both reside in the IMS of mitochondria and a fraction of both proteins exposes a soluble domain to the cytosol (Yu et al., 2009) ; (3) AIF is under proteolytic control of proteases in the IMS (calpain) and of the proteasome in the cytosol (Liu et al., 2010; Norberg et al., 2010; Wilkinson et al., 2008) , very similar to the situation we found for Nde1; (4) AIF triggers cell death when respiratory enzyme activity is impaired (Klein et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2007) , exactly as we observed for Nde1-mediated toxicity; (5) cell death is induced by a characteristic AIF fragment that distributes throughout the cytosol and the nucleus (Joza et al., 2001; Polster et al., 2005) , similar to the Nde1 fragment observed in our study; (6) the toxic potential of AIF does not require its oxidoreductase activity (Loeffler et al., 2001) , just like that of Nde1; and (7) cells of mice lacking AIF are hyper-resistant to hydrogen peroxide (Chen et al., 2014) , just as we observed for Dnde1 yeast cells. Thus, the principles of Nde1/AIF-mediated cell death are conserved from yeast to humans. It appears likely that this specific cell death program is also employed in humans to prevent the propagation of respiration-deficient cells. Little is known about the downstream effects of AIF and how it executes cell death. We found that Cdc48, the yeast homolog of the mammalian VCP/p97, plays a critical role in the proteolytic control of Nde1. Actually, apoptosis in yeast was initially discovered by studies on cdc48 mutants (Madeo et al., 1997) , potentially due to their stabilizing effects on Nde1. It will be extremely exciting to use the power of yeast genetics to elucidate the components of the apoptotic pathway downstream of Nde1/AIF and to further define the physiological relevance of this system to maintain the respiration-competence of cell populations.",

BY4742 WT, Dnde1, Doxa1, Dpdr5 strains were obtained from Euroscarf. Dnde2 single and Dnde1Dnde2 double deletions were generated in WT and Dnde1 backgrounds by replacement of NDE2 genomic reading frame with a spHIS5 (Janke et al., 2004) . To select for positive colonies, yeast transformants were plated on a selective synthetic histidine dropout medium. The colonies for nde2 knockouts were verified by PCR. Dndi1 strain was generated by replacement of NDI1 genomic reading frame with a hphB cassette. To screen for positive colonies, transformants were plated on YPD medium containing hygromycin (300 mg/ml) and the deletion was further verified by PCR. For construction of the GAL-NDE1 strain harboring a chromosomal copy of NDE1 under GAL10 promoter, a cassette containing a HIS3 marker and a GAL10 promoter was amplified by PCR from the vector pTL26 (Lafontaine and Tollervey, 1996) and inserted into the yeast genome upstream of the NDE1 open reading frame. To select for positive colonies, yeast transformants were plated on a selective synthetic histidine dropout medium and further verified by PCR. Strain lacking mtDNA (rho 0 ) was generated by treatment of the wild-type strain (BY4742) with ethidium bromide (EtBr). Briefly, EtBr was added to a concentration of 10 mg/ml and the cells were incubated at 30 C, for approximately 24 h in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose). This is followed by another two rounds of treatment with 10 mg/ml EtBr for 24 h each. Following incubation with EtBr, the cells were diluted in water and plated on YPD to obtain single colonies. The rho 0 cells were selected as cells unable to grow on YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glycerol) plates, but can grow on YPD. In rho 0 cells the loss of mtDNA was verified by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. For complementation assays, the Su9 presequence of the plasmid pYX122-mtGFP (Westermann and Neupert, 2000) was replaced by the coding sequence for Nde1 with or without stop codon using the restriction sites EcoRI and BamHI, resulting in the expression of Nde1 or a Nde1-GFP fusion protein. The Nde1 mutations at the NAD binding site were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Quick-Change method, Stratagene) using suitable primer sequences with desired mutation. After successful mutagenesis Nde1 mutants were subcloned into pYX122-mtGFP as described for Nde1. In order to express Nde1 under its own promoter, a sequence ranging from 282 bp upstream of the start codon until 197 bp downstream of the stop codon of the NDE1 open reading frame were cloned into the vector pRS423 using BamHI and SalI restriction enzymes (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989) . To generate the constructs expressing the NADH binding domain of Nde1 without or with different mitochondrial presequences, a sequence corresponding to the residues 92 to 560 of Nde1 either with or without a start codon were amplified. The resulting sequences were cloned into the BamH1 and SalI sites of a pYX122 plasmid. The plasmid was opened with EcoRI and BamH1 and sequences corresponding to either the targeting regions of Tom70 (res. 1-36), Mia40 (res. 1-70), cytochrome b D19 (res. 1-148) were inserted respectively. The resulting DNA products code for the NADH binding domain of Nde1 without or with these different presequences. They were further subcloned into EcoRI/SalI sites of the p426Gal vector, resulting in the expression of these N-terminal Nde1 fusion proteins under the GAL1 promoter. Different C-terminal truncation mutants were also constructed and cloned into the p426Gal vector to have their expression under GAL1 promoter. Full-length Nde1 was amplified and cloned into p426Gal vector using EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. Truncation mutants of Nde1 were made by amplifying Nde1 with the same forward primer as for the full length and a series of reverse primers containing a SalI recognition site with a stop codon that amplifies from residue one to each selected position on the C terminus (residues 194, 364, 429, 500, and 548) , thereby truncating the C terminus. Then these C-terminal truncations were cloned into EcoRI/SalI sites of the p426Gal vector. Yeast transformation was carried out by the lithium acetate method (Gietz et al., 1992) . Empty vectors were also transformed in parallel to serve as negative controls. For galactose induced expression of p426Gal constructs, the cultures were switched from glucose containing medium to galactose containing medium and grown for another 16 h.",

The SGA technique allows efficient introduction of a trait (mutation or marker) into systematic yeast libraries. A query strain was generated by integrating the Gal10pr-NDE1 into the NDE1 locus of a MATalpha SGA-ready strain (YMS721). Two libraries were utilized: the yeast deletion collection (Giaever et al., 2002) together with the DAmP hypomorphic allele library (Breslow et al., 2008) . SGA was performed as previously described (Cohen and Schuldiner, 2011) . Briefly: using a RoToR benchtop colony arrayer (Singer Instruments, UK) to manipulate libraries in high-density formats (384 or 1536), haploid strains from opposing mating types, each harboring a different genomic alteration, were mated on rich media plates. Diploid cells were selected on plates containing all selection markers found on both parent haploid strains. Sporulation was then induced by transferring cells to nitrogen starvation plates. Haploid cells containing all desired mutations were selected for by transferring cells to plates containing all selection markers alongside the toxic amino acid derivatives canavanine and thialysine to select against remaining diploids. The new yeast libraries, in which each colony harbored the Gal10pr-NDE1 locus on the genetic background of a single mutation, were spotted on synthetic medium with 2% glucose as control or on medium containing 3% galactose (to induce the transgene) and with addition of 50 mM acetic acid to induce apoptosis. Strains were grown for 96 hours at 30 C and then imaged. Colony size was then quantified using the Balony free software for the analysis of images of plates containing arrays of yeast (software package is maintained by Barry Young at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) (Young and Loewen, 2013) .",

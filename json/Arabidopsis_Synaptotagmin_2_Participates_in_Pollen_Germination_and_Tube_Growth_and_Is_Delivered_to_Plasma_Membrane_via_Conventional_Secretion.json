Our results showed that SYT2 was expressed mainly in the pollen of Arabidopsis thaliana. The pollen of syt2 T-DNA and RNA interference mutant lines exhibited reduced total germination and impeded pollen tube growth. Analysis of the expression of SYT2-GFP fusion protein in the pollen tube indicates that SYT2 was localized to distinct, patchy compartments but could co-localize with the Golgi markers, BODIPY TR C5 ceramide and GmMan1-mCherry. However, SYT2-DsRed-E5 was localized to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis suspension cells, in addition to the Golgi apparatus. The localization of SYT2 at the plasma membrane was further supported by immunofluorescence staining in pollen tubes. Moreover, brefeldin A treatment inhibited the transport of SYT2 to the plasma membrane and caused SYT2 to aggregate and form enlarged compartments. Truncation of the SYT2-C2AB domains also resulted in retention of SYT2 in the Golgi apparatus. An in vitro phospholipid-binding assay showed that SYT2-C2AB domains bind to the phospholipid membrane in a calcium-dependent manner. Take together, our results indicated that SYT2 was required for pollen germination and pollen tube growth, and was involved in conventional exocytosis.",

                "text": "Pollen tubes exhibit very rapid polar tip growth in which cell expansion occurs only at the extreme apex of the cell. During tip growth, the tips of the pollen tubes undergo very active exocytosis to deliver new components to the plasma membrane and the cell walls, as well as to secrete proteins via the Golgi apparatus-derived secretory vesicles (Camacho and Malh\u00f3 , 2003; Szumlanski and Nielsen, 2009; Chae and Lord, 2011; Onelli and Moscatelli, 2013) . It was found that the tip-focused Ca 2+ gradient is essential for pollen tube growth and promotes the transport, priming, and fusion of the secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane (Coelho and Malh\u00f3 , 2006; Ge et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2015) . Synaptotagmins (Syt) constitute a family of membranetrafficking proteins that regulate exo/endocytosis via membrane fusion in animal cells (Jahn et al., 2003; Craxton, 2004) and act as calcium sensors (Chapman, 2002; Tucker and Chapman, 2002) . Syt1 is a synaptic-vesicle-localized protein that facilitates SNARE-catalyzed membrane fusion in exocytosis after sensing Ca 2+ influx (Tucker et al., 2004; Apodaca, 2006; Martens et al., 2007) . Syt2 plays an additional and non-redundant role in controlling synaptic transmission in Ca 2+ -triggered neurotransmitter release, which is similar to the role of Syt1 (Pang et al., 2006; Leitzell, 2007) . Syt7 has been proposed to regulate calcium-dependent membrane fusion of lysosomes in wound repair (Martinez et al., 2000; Caler et al., 2001; Reddy et al., 2001; Jaiswal et al., 2004) . In addition, Syt7 has been reported to function as a Ca 2+ sensor in calcium-induced glucagon exocytosis (Gustavsson et al., 2009) . Syt1, Syt2, and Syt9 are known as Ca 2+ sensors and modulate fast synchronous neurotransmitter release (Xu et al., 2007) . Syt9 regulates Ca 2+ -dependent exocytosis in pancreatic islets and PC12 cells (Fukuda et al., 2002; Iezzi et al., 2004 Iezzi et al., , 2005 .",

All synaptotagmins have a similar structure: an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) region, a linker of variable length, and two tandem C2 domains, C2A and C2B (Craxton, 2007) . The C2 domains, first identified in the second conserved regulatory domain of the classical protein kinase C (Coussens et al., 1986; Cho and Stahelin, 2006) , are independently folded protein modules that bind to Ca 2+ and phospholipids (Sutton et al., 1995; Fernandez et al., 2001 ). C2A and C2B domains of Syt1 are similar structures, consisting of compact b-sandwiches with eight b-strands connected by three flexible loops (Fernandez et al., 2001; Chapman, 2002) . Five aspartic acid residues coordinating Ca 2+ in loop1 and loop3 of each C2 domain of Syt1 are conserved only in a subset of synaptotagmins (Chapman, 2002; Koh and Bellen, 2003) .",

SYT1 (also called SytA) helps maintain the integrity of the plasma membrane when the membrane is disrupted by freezing (Yamazaki et al., 2008) and osmotic stress (Schapire et al., 2008) . Another study illustrated SYT1 regulation of endocytosis and mediation of the transport of virus movement proteins between cells (Lewis and Lazarowitz, 2010; Uchiyama et al., 2014) . SYT1 accumulates at the haustorial membrane around the invading oomycete Phytophthora infestans in Nicotiana benthamiana host leaf cells (Lu et al., 2012; Bozkurt et al., 2014) . Moreover, SYT1 also accumulates in a fraction of detergent-resistant plasma membrane microdomains after cold acclimation (Minami et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 2013) and was detected as an interacting partner of the brassinosteroid receptor kinase BRI1 (Wang et al., 2013) . A recent study also demonstrated that Arabidopsis SYT1 is a component of ER-PM contact sites, which maintain the mechanical stability of the cells (Perez Sancho et al., 2015) . Surprisingly, synaptotagmin and the eyespot assembly proteins EYE3 and SOUL3 have recently been reported in the plastoglubuli proteome of halotolerant green algae Dunaliella (Davidi et al., 2015) . Finally, synaptotagmin was involved in rhizobia-legume symbiosis in Medicago spp. (Rose et al., 2012) and in roots of Robinia pseudoacacia entering symbiosis with Mesorhizobium amorphae (Chen et al., 2013) .",

No GUS staining was observed in the wildtype ovules after pollination with transgenic pollen grains; nevertheless, the staining of transgenic pollen tubes was evident in the pistils ( Figure 1H ). These data suggested that SYT2 was also expressed in pollen tubes grown in vivo in pistils. On the other hand, after the pistils of transgenic plants were pollinated by pollen from wild-type plants, GUS staining of the fertilized and enlarged ovules became weaker and disappeared ( Figure 1I ), while the unpollinated ovules remained small and strongly stained ( Figure 1J ).

The homozygous syt2-1, syt2-2, syt2-3, and RNAi-#5 lines represented a 13.1%, 18.3%, 25.2%, and 32.2% reduction in the average length of pollen tubes, respectively. More than 66% of wild-type pollen tubes were longer than 95 mm and only 0.3% were shorter than 55 mm. The mutants had a markedly lower percentage of pollen tubes longer than 95 mm, compared with the wild-type. The proportions of pollen tubes <55 mm were considerably higher in the mutant lines, especially the RNAi mutant. We found 30.9% of RNAi-#5 pollen tubes to be <55 mm ( Figure 2E ). We also measured the lengths of pollen tubes from 1 h to 3 h, and the results showed that the pollen of SYT2 mutants had already germinated and grown much the same length as that of wild-type at 1 h (Supplemental Figure 4) . However, the growth rates of pollen tubes of SYT2 mutants were slower than that of wild-type after 1 h. In addition, the growth rates of pollen tubes of both wild-type and the mutant lines were very slow after 5 h of imbibition, but the growth rate of SYT2 mutant was still lower than that of wild-type (Supplemental Table 2 ). Thus, we showed that the shorter pollen tubes of SYT2 mutants were not due to delayed germination but retarded elongation.",

The results for both showed that the SYT2-GFP fusion protein was localized to distinct patches in the growing pollen tubes but rarely to the plasma membrane ( Figure 3 , Supplemental Figure 5Aa and 5Ac). In stable transgenic pLAT52:SYT2-GFP Arabidopsis, the SYT2-GFP-containing compartments were co-localized with the Golgi dye BODIPY TR C5 ceramide (B-34400; Invitrogen) and the Golgi marker GmMan1-mCh, the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain of GmMan1 fused with mCherry (Nelson et al., 2007) , which was transiently expressed by particle bombardment but not the endocytic vesicle marker FM4-64 and the ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX ( Figure 3A ). To further examine the subcellular localization of SYT2-GFP, we treated the pollen tubes with the secretion inhibitor BFA (35.6 mM) and the late endosomes/ autophagy inhibitor wortmannin (10 mM) for 30 min after 3 h of germination. The results showed that SYT2-GFP formed enlarged aggregates after BFA treatment and decorated around the FM4-64-stained BFA compartments featuring the Golgi localization of SYT2-GFP ( Figure 3B ). Wortmannin slightly changed the morphology of SYT2-GFP vesicles in the pollen tubes, but SYT2-GFP was not accumulated into the wortmannin-induced multivesicular compartments indicating that SYT2-GFP was not localized to the trans-Golgi network and the prevacuoles ( Figure 3B ).",

Therefore, we employed DsRed-E5 to label SYT2 and established a stably transformed Arabidopsis suspension cell line expressing SYT2-DsRed-E5 driven by a 35S promoter. The SYT2-DsRed-E5 fusion protein in suspension cells displayed a patchy distribution similar to that of SYT2-GFP in to-bacco and Arabidopsis pollen tubes. Moreover, SYT2-DsRed-E5 fluorescence signal was also clearly detected on the plasma membrane in the red fluorescence channel ( Figure 4A ), while DsRed-E5 alone was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and inside the nuclei (Supplemental Figure 5C ). A z-stack projection of the images in Figure 4A is shown in Figure 4B . By comparing the fluorescent lines on the cell periphery (indicated by arrows in Figure 4A and 4B) with the non-fluorescent trans-vacuolar cytoplasmic strands (indicated by arrows in Figure 4C ), we inferred that the fine fluorescent lines were not on the tonoplast but on the plasma membrane.

As shown in Figure 5B , the green fluorescence on both V 1 and V 2 vesicles was stronger than the red fluorescence, as the green/red signal ratio of V 1 was 7.6:1 and that of V 2 was 6.8:1 ( Figure 5B ). Red fluorescence on the plasma membrane was stronger than the green fluorescence, as the green/red signal ratio of the plasma membrane was 1:5.2 ( Figure 5B ). The intensities of green and red fluorescence signals of DsRed-E5 alone in the cells were similar, with a green/red signal ratio of 1.7 ( Figure 5B) . A previous study reported that a red/green ratio R1 indicated that the DsRed-E5 protein was produced more than 10 h ago in vitro in Caenorhabditis elegans cells (Terskikh et al., 2000) , and approximately more than 30 h ago in cowpea mesophyll protoplasts (Mirabella et al., 2004) . This indicated that the majority of SYT2-DsRed-E5 proteins on the plasma membrane had been synthesized at least 10 h previously, which demonstrated that the SYT2 protein was transported from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane over time.",

Similar to SYT2-GFP, SYT2 DC2AB -GFP accumulated in distinct patches in the cytoplasm ( Figure 7A ) and was highly co-localized with the C5-ceramide-stained Golgi apparatus ( Figure 7B ). SYT2 DC2AB -DsRed-E5 also showed distinct patchy distribution in the cytoplasm ( Figure 7C) , and there was no obvious difference between the distributions of SYT2 DC2AB -GFP and SYT2 DC2AB -DsRed-E5. However, unlike the full length of SYT2-DsRed-E5 (Figure 4) , only a trace amount of SYT2 DC2AB -DsRed-E5 red fluorescence was detected on the plasma membrane ( Figure 7C ).

In the Arabidopsis database (i.e., TAIR), there are five SYT genes containing one transmembrane domain and two C2 domains (Craxton, 2004) . These genes may share a common ancestral gene, as the exonintron structures among the SYT genes are highly conserved (Yamazaki et al., 2010) . Unlike the ubiquitous expression of SYT1 in Arabidopsis, we clearly demonstrated by promoter analysis that SYT2 was expressed mainly in the female and male gametophytes of Arabidopsis, especially in the developing embryo sacs, pollen grains, and the growing pollen tubes (Figure. 1A, 1F, and 1G) . Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis also showed that SYT2 was highly expressed in stamens, particularly in pollen grains. The results from both promoter and RT-PCR analyses are in agreement with the microarray data for the At1G20080 gene available from the Genevestigator database (https://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch) (Zimmermann et al., 2004) . All these data suggest that SYT2 plays a specific role in the development and growth of female and male gametophytes. Subcellular localization of synaptotagmins is essential to determine protein functions (Schapire et al., 2008) . Previous reports showed that mammalian Syt1 and Syt7 are localized to synaptic vesicles and lysosomes, respectively, and are proposed to be Ca 2+ sensors regulating the neurotransmitter release and/or resealing of the plasma membrane (Brose et al., 1992; Reddy et al., 2001) .",

SYT2-DsRed-E5 was localized to the plasma membrane as well as in distinct patches around the nuclei. This fluorescent timer showed that the newly synthesized SYT2 was first localized on the Golgi apparatus, and then transferred to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the C2 domains were necessary to transport SYT2 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The secretion inhibitor BFA also prevented the transport of SYT2 to the plasma membrane.

These results provide evidence that the two SYTs are playing different roles in Arabidopsis. SYT1 is required to maintain the integrity of plasma membranes during freezing conditions (Yamazaki et al., 2008) , osmotic stress (Schapire et al., 2008) , and mechanical stress (Perez Sancho et al., 2015) .

GFP (27 kDa) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has similar molecular weight and topology to DsRed monomer (28 kDa) from a coral of the Discosoma genus (Terskikh et al., 2002; Chudakov et al., 2010) . However, DsRed shows a slow rate of fluorescence development and forms an obligate tetramer in vitro and in living cells (Baird et al., 2000; Yarbrough et al., 2001 ). We are proposing two possible scenarios explaining why SYT2-GFP cannot be transferred to the plasma membrane. First, the chemical property of GFP interrupts the interactions between the C2 domains of SYT2 and the plasma membrane or other protein components that are essential for the membrane fusion process. On the other hand, the effect of DsRed-E5 is less noticeable. Second, the clustering or oligomerization of SYT2 proteins is necessary Initially, the green fluorescence on V 0 was stronger than the red fluorescence (GF/RF > 1), while the red fluorescence on M 0 was stronger than the green fluorescence (GF/RF < 1). There was no obvious difference in the GF/RF ratio between V 0 and V 20 ; however, the GF/RF ratio of V 40 was significantly different from that of V (t-test, *p < 0.05). Compared with M , the RF/GF ratios of M 20 and M 40 were significantly increased (t-test, *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01, respectively). To measure the fluorescence signals, 10 cells of each group were analyzed, and five vesicles were chosen randomly from each cell for statistical analysis. Error bars represented \u00b1SE (n = 70).

Fusion of GFP to the C terminus of SYT2 prevents this oligomerization while DsRed-E5 compensates this disruption by forming a tetramer, bringing SYT2 close enough to function properly in exocytosis. Since exocytosis can be divided into three steps, docking, priming, and release, further studies on how SYT2 interacts with other components may provide better understanding of the roles of SYT2 in exocytosis. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that DsRed-E5 also affects endocytosis for recycling the SYT2 back from the plasma membrane. More protein interactome analysis would be helpful to reveal the function of SYT2 in exocytosis/endocytosis. The functions of Arabidopsis synaptotagmins are often inferred from animal synaptotagmins, based on the similarity of the sequences and domain architectures. However, there is no direct evidence that plant synaptotagmins mediate membrane fusion in cells. This may be due to the difficulty in establishing a plant membrane fusion test system in vivo (Zarsky et al., 2009) . Therefore, alternative methods must be used to obtain circumstantial evidence. The in vitro phospholipid-binding assay is a well-established system of determining whether a protein binds to phospholipid bilayers in a calcium-dependent or -independent manner. The Ca 2+ -binding affinity of animal Syt1, determined in vitro, is similar to the physiologically relevant concentrations in cells (Geppert et al., 1994 ). (A) SYT2-GFP localized on the Golgi apparatus, but not all C5 ceramidestained signals overlapped with SYT2-GFP. (B) The C-terminal tagged SYT2 DC2AB -GFP lacking C2AB domains showed a punctate distribution, and was localized to the C5 ceramidestained Golgi apparatus. (C) SYT2 DC2AB -DsRED-E5 localized to the Golgi apparatus, but not the plasma membrane. Bars represent 10 mm. DIC, Differential Interference Contrast. The C2A domain (A), C2B domain (B), and C2AB domain (C) of SYT2 were incubated with liposomes in the presence of the indicated concentrations of free Ca 2+ (clamped with Ca 2+ /EGTA buffers) to estimate partial binding of free Ca 2+ . The amino acid residues at positions 244-400 represent the C2A domain of SYT2, 401-537 represent the C2B domain of SYT2, and 247-537 represent the C2AB domain of SYT2. Purified GST fusion proteins containing the corresponding residues of SYT2 C2 domains were incubated in various concentrations of free Ca 2+ with liposomes composed of 25% PS/75% PC. Liposomes were precipitated by centrifugation, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The EC 50 for C2AB was 2-3 mM. Error bars represent \u00b1SE (n = 3).",

This calcium-dependent binding property of SYT2 is correlated with the maximal calcium concentration at the pollen tube tips and supports the physiological function of SYT2 on transporting the secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane in the rapid-growing pollen tubes.",

In this study, we identified three T-DNA insertion mutants (syt2-1, syt2-2, and syt2-3) and obtained an RNAi mutant of SYT2. SYT2 mutations resulted in the reduction of pollen germination and shorter pollen tubes compared with the wild-type ( Figure 2D and 2E) . The loss-of-function mutants of SYT2 had a slower rate of pollen tube growth (Supplemental Figure 4 and Supplemental Table 2 ).

For pollen tubes, our data showed that BFA inhibited transport of SYT2 to the plasma membrane and disrupted the normal localization of SYT2 on the Golgi apparatus in suspension cells ( Figure 6 ). In the tip-growing pollen tubes, SYT2 was involved in conventional secretion. This may be due to differences in the cell culture systems. We used pollen tubes and suspension cell cultures for subcellular localization, while a previous report used root cells and protoplasts (Zhang et al., 2011) .

All plasmid DNA was prepared using the Ultra-Clean Endotoxin-Free Maxi Plasmid Prep Kit (Beijing ZEPING Bioscience). Golgi marker GmMan1-mCherry (G-rk, CD3-967) was purchased from the Arabidopsis stock center (http://www.arabidopsis.org). A quantity of 10 mg of mature pollen grains was used in each bombardment. Pollen germination medium (0.01% H BO 3 , 1 mM MgSO 4 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM Ca(NO 3 ) 2 , 18% sucrose, and 20 mM MES [pH 6.5-7.0]) was prepared to incubate pollen grains (Fan et al., 2001) . Pollen suspension was spotted and solidified on a nylon membrane in 90-mm petri dishes. Gene bombardment was performed using the helium-driven PDS-1000/He system (Bio-Rad). Plasmid DNA, 0.1 M spermidine, and 2.5 M CaCl were attached to gold particles (1 mm), according to the Bio-Rad manual (Sanford et al., 1993; Chen et al., 2002) . A total of 3 mg of DNA was used to coat 1 mg of gold particles. Each prepared sample was bombarded twice toward an individual pollen sample to improve the frequency of transformation. Bombardments were performed under the following conditions: 71-cm (28-inch) Hg chamber vacuum, 1100-psi rupture disc, 6.4 mm (0.25-inch) gap distance, and 2.5-cm (1 inch) particle travel distance. Boomed pollen grains were washed from the nylon membrane using germination medium and germinated in 35-mm petri dishes with shaking at 60 rpm in the dark. Pollen tubes were observed using an Olympus FV300-IX700 laser scanning confocal microscope. Images were analyzed using an FV1000 viewer (version 1.6).",

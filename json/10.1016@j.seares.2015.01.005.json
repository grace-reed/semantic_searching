    "abstract": "As global climate change is predicted to gradually alter the oceans' carbonate system and water temperature, knowledge about the effects an altered marine environment has on the physiology of reef building (hermatypic) coral species is more widely established. However, although it is recognized that seawater temperature and the carbonate system of a coral reef can change rapidly and with great amplitude, little is known about how the interaction of these natural fluctuations with long term effects of climate change may affect the metabolism and productivity of hermatypic corals. To investigate this, we acclimated the hermatypic coral Stylophora pistillata to a \"worst case\" scenario for carbon dioxide emissions (aragonite saturation state [\u03a9 ARAG ] = 1.6), and tested how exposure to short term (24 h) elevated temperature (+3\u00b0C) and further lowered \u03a9 ARAG (\u22121 unit) affected its photosynthesis and respiration. While episodic exposure to very low \u03a9 ARAG had only little effect on S. pistillata's physiology, short term heat stress caused a shift from net oxygen production to consumption and partial coral bleaching. Higher gross coral respiration, and lowered photosynthetic activity under episodically elevated temperature may have been the result of photoinhibition and partial coral bleaching. These findings suggest that fluctuating environmental conditions in combination with a low \u03a9 ARAG background signal may impair basic metabolic processes in calcifying corals. In a future high-CO world short term stress could be relevant for reef ecosystem processes, and may affect the resilience of coral reefs to other external influences and effects of climate change.",

Precipitation of CaCO by calcifying organisms requires \u03a9 to be greater than one, but this becomes thermodynamically more difficult and thus increases metabolic costs as \u03a9 decreases (Dubinsky and Stambler, 2011; The Royal Society, 2005) . Therefore, rising CO 2 levels and the resulting acidification of seawater could be a major threat to marine calcifying organisms, as it is indicated by an extensive body of research (reviewed by Fabry et al., 2008; Kleypas and Langdon, 2006; Kroeker et al., 2013) . Of the marine taxa that are impaired by elevated temperature and CO 2 concentrations, reef forming (hermatypic) corals (Schuhmacher and Zibrowius, 1985) may be particularly affected (Kroeker et al., 2010) . Supplied with photosynthetic energy from their zooxanthellae (endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, genus Symbiodinium - Dubinsky and Stambler, 2011) , hermatypic corals can precipitate large amounts of aragonite and often aggregate to complex and extensive reef structuresbiodiversity hotspots with enormous socio-economic and ecological value (Dubinsky and Stambler, 2011; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007) . A reduction in \u03a9 ARAG as a result of increased CO -influx might result in decreased reef productivity and increased coral mortality (Kleypas, 1999) , but may also lower the resilience of corals to other stressors. Elevated temperature for example can have detrimental effects on coral physiology by disturbing the symbiotic relationship between the coral host and its sensitive symbiotic algae. Under increased temperature zooxanthellae can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative damage in the host cells (Dunn et al., 2004) . To protect itself the host animal expels the symbiotic algae (Dunn et al., 2004 )a process that is also known as coral bleaching (Fitt et al., 2001) . Corals are able to expel a significant proportion of their symbionts in a matter of hours while maintaining their metabolic functions (Jones and Hoegh-Guldberg, 1998 ). However, under prolonged temperature stress, coral bleaching may increase coral respiration and reduce productivity (Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989) , decrease photosynthetic efficiency (Borell and Bischof, 2008) , and can ultimately result in tissue necrosis and death (Dunn et al., 2004) .",

However, currently observed global seawater CO concentrations are not only spatially inhomogeneous, but also show temporal variation on very short timescales (Hofmann et al., 2011) . These CO 2 fluctuations are the result of upwelling events (Feely et al., 2008; Mahadevan et al., 2011; McElhany and Busch, 2012) and diurnal patterns in community metabolism (Feely et al., 2010; Kleypas and Langdon, 2006) . Sea surface temperature may also change quickly as a function of cloud cover, precipitation and evaporation (Webster et al., 1996) . Especially coral reefs are the subject of considerable fluctuations of seawater conditions: \u03a9 ARAG can drop by up to units within days to as low as 1.5 (Frankignoulle et al., 1996; Kleypas and Langdon, 2006; Ohde and van Woesik, 1999) , and temperature can increase by up to 3\u00b0C per day (Castillo and Helmuth, 2005; Jones and Hoegh-Guldberg, 1998; Putnam and Edmunds, 2011) . These intense short-term changes of environmental conditions could have the potential to complicate our understanding of how corals respond to the effects of climate change (Hendriks et al., 2010; Kroeker et al., 2010) , but little is known how high frequency dynamics of temperature and \u03a9 ARAG may affect the physiology of hermatypic corals.",

However, temperature and \u03a9 ARAG in coral reefs can change rapidly (Kleypas and Langdon, 2006) , a phenomenon that is likely to be amplified by strong effects of global change in the tropics (IPCC, 2013; The Royal Society, 2005) . In a future low aragonite environment, these naturally occurring fluctuations in temperature and \u03a9 ARAG may have a considerable impact on coral physiology, as they may add up to a low \u03a9 ARAG background signal. To investigate how coral physiology reacts to naturally occurring abiotic fluctuations in addition to a low \u03a9 ARAG background signal, we acclimated colonies of the hermatypic coral Stylophora pistillata to low \u03a9 ARAG and exposed them to elevated temperature and further lowered \u03a9 ARAG ; each separately and in combination. During 24 hour laboratory experiments (12 h light:12 h dark) photosynthetic rates, respiration, and signs of bleaching were recorded. \u03a9 ARAG was adjusted based on values of currently observed ranges of daily fluctuations and on the level of predicted future values in tropical latitudes (Kleypas, 1999) . We discuss how our results compare to the findings of other studies with different time frames, and list possible mechanisms that may cause shifts in coral metabolism as a result of rapid changes in temperature and \u03a9 ARAG .",

This particular coral species was used because it may be particularly threatened from climate change: its relatively thin coral tissue (Bhagooli and Hidaka, 2004) and disadvantageous light scattering properties (Enrquez et al., 2005) may negatively influence resistance to multiple stressors. Moreover, S. pistillata is well represented in scientific literature, which allows for comparison to findings from previous experiments that used similar stressors. In November 2009, 10 coral colonies of S. pistillata's pink phenotype were acquired from DeJong Marine Life Corp., Spijksesteeg 2a, 4212KG in Spijk, Netherlands, and transported to the Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Ecology (ZMT) in Bremen, Germany, where all experiments were conducted.",

The mesocosm tank system was filled with artificial seawater that had been contained in the tank for several years to maintain tropical calcifying corals and also contained other coral species, benthic fauna and reef fishes to simulate a near nature environment. Two weeks after colonies of S. pistillata were placed inside the mesocosm, \u03a9 ARAG was gradually reduced by controlled inflow of CO 2 (Biogon). \u03a9 ARAG was used to parameterize manipulations in carbonate chemistry for this study, because it seems to be more closely associated with physiological processes of calcifying organisms than just pH or CO 2 content (Hofmann et al., 2011) . Between November 2009 and January 2010, \u03a9 ARAG decreased from approx. 3 to 1.63 \u00b1 0.13. During this time only one colony of S. pistillata died, while the nine colonies that successfully acclimated to a low \u03a9 ARAG environment appeared healthy (morphology, color, polyp extension) and showed obvious skeletal growth. Therefore it was assumed that the lowered \u03a9 ARAG value was tolerable by the corals, and that the conditions in the mesocosm were applicable as the experimental control.",

To ensure proper coral nutrition, Artemia spp. brine shrimp were fed to the colonies every three days, since a lack of heterotrophic nutrition can significantly alter photosynthesis and respiration in corals (Borell and Bischof, 2008; Hoogenboom et al., 2012) . Salinity, temperature and pH were monitored twice a day (WTW 350i) with a temperature/conductivity probe and a Clark-type electrode (WTW), calibrated with certified TRIS buffers. Total alkalinity (TA) was adjusted with a carbonate reactor that provided HCO 3 \u2212 and Ca + ions. TA was controlled once a week with acidbase titration (titration stand, Schott) that was calibrated using a certified sea-water standard (Hach). With pH and TA; \u03a9 ARAG , pCO 2 , HCO 3 \u2212 , CO 3 2 \u2212 and CO 2 aq could be calculated using the program CO2SYS (Pierrot et al., 2006) .

There were at least three weeks between each use, which has been observed to be sufficient for S. pistillata's recovery from short term stress (Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith, 1989) . During the time between experiments coral health was assessed by checking polyp extension, coloration, and growth estimation. The effects of coral colony identity and previous use in a low \u03a9 ARAG stress or a control measurement were also statistically tested.",

In a closed compartment the change of O 2 concentration as a result of production or consumption by a coral colony was measured in recurrent (intermittent) periods. During a measurement period, seawater was constantly pumped through a closed water cycle that consisted of a respiration chamber where the coral was placed, a temperature probe (PT100, Driessen & Kern) and an O sensor (Oxi 340i & Clark Type Cellox 325, both WTW). A cogwheel pump ensured adequate mixing inside the respiration chamber and a steady water flow against the sensors. The change of O 2 saturation over time was recorded until saturation within the closed cycle reached a pre-adjusted upper threshold at 120% or lower threshold at 70%. When either of these thresholds were reached, a computer control unit (DT9803, Data Translation), automatically opened a valve and flushed the measurement cycle with seawater from a reservoir tank that had an O 2 saturation of approx 100%. When the O 2 sensor inside the measurement cycle detected a saturation of between 90% and 105%, the valve closed the cycle and a new measurement period was initiated.",

A Tukey post-hoc analysis was used to check if rates were significantly different between the treatments.

At the time the trials with this treatment were conducted, a leak in the carbonate reactor increased TA in the mesocosm seawater that was used for this treatment from a mean of 1381 \u00b1 103 \u03bcmol kg \u22121 to 1788 \u00b1 136 \u03bcmol kg \u22121 (Table 1) . This was discovered too late and because the pH computer was calibrated for lower TA, \u03a9 ARAG was not reduced by one unit to the target level of approx 0.6, but to 1.01 \u00b1 0.19 instead. Furthermore, a programming error in the temperature control unit resulted in an average water temperature that was about 1.2\u00b0C higher in the low \u03a9 ARAG treatment than the targeted 26.69 \u00b1 0.29\u00b0C in the control. A temperature of 27.9 \u00b1 0.18\u00b0C is considered to be within S. pistillata's range of tolerance (Jones and Hoegh-Guldberg, 1998) , but because the coral colonies used in this study were acclimated to a temperature of 26.69 \u00b1 0.29 it may already have affected their metabolism. However, as the adjusted conditions for the low \u03a9 ARAG treatment were not inherently flawed and still relatively close to the range of the targeted values, the measurements from these experiments were used for analysis. All nine colonies of S. pistillata survived the 24 h exposure to control conditions from the mesocosm, elevated temperature, low \u03a9 ARAG and the combination of both stressors. In the light, the corals' photosynthetic rates were 0.14 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bcmol O 2 cm \u22122 h \u22121 in the control and 0.06 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcmol O 2 cm \u22122 h \u22121 under low \u03a9 Arag ; both different with marginal significance (P = 0.08). Elevated temperature, alone and in combination with low \u03a9 ARAG caused S. pistillata to consume O with a rate of 0.09 \u00b1 0.16 \u03bcmol cm \u22122 h \u22121 and 0.135 \u00b1 0.13 \u03bcmol cm \u22122 h \u22121 , respectively. These consumption rates were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.04). Across all treatments in the light phase, elevated temperature had a highly significant effect on S. pistillata (GLMM, P = 0.001), causing net O consumption, whereas low \u03a9 Arag had no effect on S. pistillata's O 2 balance (GLMM, P = 0.31). There was no interactive effect of low \u03a9 ARAG and elevated temperature (GLMM, P = 0.733), and also no influence of colony identity (GLMM, P = 0.8) and previous use of a coral colony (GLMM, P = 0.4) as random effects on photosynthesis or respiration in the light.",

Agostini et al. (2013) and Al-Horani and Al-Moghrabi (2003) detected changes in the diffusive boundary layer (DBL) of the coral, identifying it as a possible aspect of the protective mechanism. Through the DBL the coral-polyps can mitigate seawater-pH to more favorable conditions, both under normal and high CO 2 , by high photosynthetic rates and the consumption of CO 2 . Elevated net photosynthesis rate under elevated CO 2 was also observed by Langdon and Atkinson (2005) who used an outdoor laboratory setup. The resulting higher irradiance levels could explain this increase, as opposed to the lack of effect with lower irradiance featured in this study (approx. 200 \u03bcmol photons cm \u2212 2 s \u22121 ). The hypothesis that scleractinian corals can sustain basic physiological mechanisms like photosynthesis independent of the duration of a CO 2 stress event is also supported by Fine and Tchernov (2007) , who observed a reduction of the coral skeleton but an increase in polyp biomass over a longer period of time.",

                "text": "Elevated temperature had a highly significant effect on the metabolism of S. pistillata: the recorded negative net O 2 balance indicates that coral respiration exceeded gross photosynthesis. Because the respirometer used in this study was not able to distinguish between photosynthesis and respiration, this hypothesis stems from the observed increased dark respiration rate, and similar findings from several short-term studies (Al-Horani, 2005; Nordemar et al., 2003; Nystr\u00f6m et al., 2001) . A strong effect of temperature has also been observed in previous studies that used long (Rodolfo-Metalpa et al., 2010) and medium (Hoogenboom et al., 2012; Middlebrook et al., 2010) exposure of different coral species to heat. This suggests that the effects of temperature stress on photo-physiological processes within a hermatypic coral are mostly negative and may not depend on the duration of the stress exerted. However, in none of the aforementioned studies elevated temperature resulted in a shift to net O 2 consumption, as observed in this study. While some variation in response may stem from experimental conditions like irradiance and feeding, coral responses seem to vary with the studied species and the organisms' respective \"temperature-history\" (Castillo and Helmuth, 2005; Flores-Ram\u00edrez and Li\u00f1\u00e1n Cabello, 2007) . In this study, acclimation to moderate ambient temperatures of 26.69 \u00b1 0.29 in the mesocosm could explain the observed strong negative reaction to a temperature increase of 3\u00b0C. The studies cited above acclimated the corals to higher temperatures and used higher irradiance, which could have resulted in higher production rates and thus a positive O 2 balance.",

This may be due to a relatively thin tissue thickness (Enrquez et al., 2005) , with lower temperature buffering capacity, and a skeletal morphology that facilitates high in hospite irradiance (Fitt et al., 2009) . Beside species specific effects there are general physiological consequences of elevated temperature for a zooxanthellate coral. Overall more O is consumed by the host through oxidative phosphorylation, because the coral becomes more active with higher temperature and therefore requires more ATP (Al-Horani, 2005 ). Furthermore, dynamic and chronic photoinhibition can occur during short-and long-term (Bhagooli and Hidaka, 2004) temperature stress and cause a dramatic reduction of the efficiency of the photosystem II to prevent over-reduction at the electron-transportsystem (Bhagooli and Hidaka, 2004; Jones and Hoegh-Guldberg, 1998) . Other effects of photoinhibition are the release of excess energy as additional heat, which can additionally compromise the host, and the formation of ROS. The coral host tolerates these harmful byproducts of the photosystem-electron-transfer up to a threshold (Downs et al., 2002) . At a certain ROS concentration in the host, the symbionts are expelled to prevent cellular damage within the holobiont (Flores-Ram\u00edrez and Li\u00f1\u00e1n Cabello, 2007; Jones and Hoegh-Guldberg, 1998) , leading to coral bleaching. This process is reversible if the heat stress ceases soon enough and host tissue is not damaged beyond repair (Dunn et al., 2004) . Expulsion seems to be a last resort in protecting the coral host from excessive heat, but, as results from this and other cited studies suggest (Agostini et al., 2013; Nordemar et al., 2003) , may be carried out at any point of time. This could be an explanation for the observed partial bleaching during the elevated temperature treatments. These processesphotoinhibition, and expulsion of O 2 -producing symbionts in combination with elevated host respirationcould have led to the observed net respiration during the light phase and elevated respiration during the dark phase.",

The increased dark respiration suggests that light respiration exceeds gross photosynthesis and causes net O consumption. This reaction was not expected and also differs from similar short term studies (Agostini et al., 2013; Reynaud et al., 2003) . We anticipated that elevated CO concentration would meet the increased CO demand caused by elevated temperature on the photosynthetic rate by increasing the concentration gradient between seawater and the CO 2 -binding components of the photosystems within the zooxanthellae. However, since increased CO 2 in the \u03a9 ARAG treatment did not induce elevated photosynthesis, this hypothesis can be rejected. Elevated temperature may cause photoinhibition and the expulsion of symbionts, causing a disruption in the energy transfer system and increased respiration. The statistical analysis revealed that only temperature had a significant effect, both on photosynthesis and respiration, and therefore seems to be the predominant factor in the combined stress experiment.",

Still, little is known about how a highly variable environment interacts with the slowly progressing effects of climate change, and how this might affect the reef community. This study may provide a first insight in how the physiology of hermatypic coral that has acclimated to a low \u03a9 ARAG environment responds to episodic heat stress and further lowered \u03a9 ARAG . While very low \u03a9 ARAG had only little effect on S. pistillata's physiology, short term heat stress induced a significant metabolic reaction in S. pistillata. The observed shift to net O 2 consumption under elevated temperature could be due to higher gross coral respiration, and lowered photosynthetic activity as a consequence of partial coral bleaching. The expulsion of zooxanthellae and photoinhibition may be the cause for this metabolic depression.",

The findings from this study suggest that episodic stress in addition to a low \u03a9 ARAG background signal can impair basic metabolic processes in S. pistillata, a species with a relatively narrow range of tolerance. As a consequence, species that react heavily to episodic stress may also have a lower resilience to other external influences and multiple stressors. As global climate change gradually alters the marine environment, diurnal events of heat stress and very low \u03a9 ARAG as a result of upwelling or community metabolism may affect how reef building corals acclimate to future conditions. Species with low tolerance to these events might be displaced earlier and the resulting shifts in reef community composition (Widdicombe and Spicer, 2008) may in turn affect reef ecosystem function and stability (Dubinsky and Stambler, 2011; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007) . We argue that environmental stress during short timescales can be physiologically and ecologically relevant for hermatypic corals and may influence how coral reefs adapt to future climate changes.",

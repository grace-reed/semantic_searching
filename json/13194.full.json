It has been suggested that reef corals may adapt to climate change by changing their dominant symbiont type to a more thermally tolerant one, although the capacity for such a shift is potentially hindered by the compatibility of different host-symbiont pairings. Here we combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to characterize the molecular, cellular, and physiological processes that underlie this compatibility, with a particular focus on Symbiodinium trenchii, an opportunistic, thermally tolerant symbiont that flourishes in coral tissues after bleaching events. Symbiont-free individuals of the sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida (commonly referred to as Aiptasia), an established model system for the study of the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, were colonized with the \"normal\" (homologous) symbiont Symbiodinium minutum and the heterologous S. trenchii. Analysis of the host gene and metabolite expression profiles revealed that heterologous symbionts induced an expression pattern intermediate between the typical symbiotic state and the aposymbiotic state. Furthermore, integrated pathway analysis revealed that increased catabolism of fixed carbon stores, metabolic signaling, and immune processes occurred in response to the heterologous symbiont type. Our data suggest that both nutritional provisioning and the immune response induced by the foreign \"invader\" are important factors in determining the capacity of corals to adapt to climate change through the establishment of novel symbioses.",

Bidirectional exchange of organic and inorganic compounds is central to the ecological success and stability of the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis and is critically important to the construction and persistence of coral reef ecosystems (reviewed in ref. 1) . The algal symbiont receives dissolved inorganic nutrients (i.e., carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) from the host and also may receive host-derived amino acids, lipids, and fatty acids (2) . In return, symbionts translocate products of carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation to the host, including sugars (especially glucose), amino acids, and lipids (3, 4) .",

Bleaching can cause decreased coral growth, fecundity, and fitness and dramatically increased mortality; therefore, it poses a major threat to the future of coral reefs (5) . However, sublethal bleaching may present an opportunity for the existing mixed Symbiodinium community resident within a host to \"shuffle\" to an alternative dominant type or \"switch\" to a new type acquired from the surrounding environment (6, 7). Either mechanism could enable the holobiont (i.e., the coral, Symbiodinium, and other symbiotic microbes) to better withstand changing ocean conditions, such as elevated sea surface temperatures (6) . These putative mechanisms are founded on the considerable molecular and physiological diversity within the genus Symbiodinium, with a single host species displaying different physiologies depending on the Symbiodinium type that it hosts (8) .",

The mechanisms responsible for the dynamic regulation and persistence of the symbiosis involve modulation of both the host immune response (9) (10) (11) and nutritional fluxes between the two partners (8) . Different symbiont strains may release different types and quantities of photosynthate to the host and hence influence the nutritional potential of the symbiosis and its overall fitness (8, 12, 13) .

We coupled gene expression data with high-throughput metabolite profiling to compare the effects on the sea anemone Aiptasia when colonized by the thermally tolerant, opportunistic, but comparatively unproductive Symbiodinium trenchii vs. the regular symbiont species, Symbiodinium minutum.

Hosts fully colonized with S. trenchii either occupy an intermediate position between aposymbiotic and S. minutum-colonized hosts or are more closely aligned with aposymbiotic hosts ( Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 ). Numerous gene expression studies have documented differences between the symbiotic and aposymbiotic state in corals and sea anemones (25) , including recent highthroughput RNA-Seq studies (11, 26) . Two microarray studies that examined gene expression of hosts colonized with homologous and heterologous symbionts also showed distinct host expression profiles as a function of symbiont type (9, 27) . We grouped information from the expression and metabolite profiling and integrated analysis into functional categories highlighting genes and metabolites likely involved in the cnidarian-Symbiodinium symbiosis. What emerged is a picture of dramatically different biological processes involved in immunity, cell signaling, and metabolism between hosts fully colonized by homologous symbionts and those colonized by heterologous symbionts (Fig. 2 , Table 1 , and Datasets S3, S5, and S6). Such differences could contribute to the relatively rapid rate of colonization by homologous symbionts compared with heterologous symbionts in Aiptasia (28) .

In addition, ROS mitigation is a hallmark of cnidariandinoflagellate symbiosis physiology, given that hosts need mechanisms to manage hyperoxia and the ROS produced by their highly productive symbionts (33) . Our results demonstrate a disruption of cellular oxidative homeostasis in the heterologous S. trenchii-colonized hosts.

The lipid hydrolyzers diacylglycerol lipase and phospholipase A2 were upregulated in S. trenchii-colonized hosts. Likewise, there was higher abundance of arachidonic acid (ARA; C20:4); a downstream product of hydrolysis and an essential PUFA. There was also an up-regulation of two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP3A4/5), which catalyze ARA and other PUFAs to biologically active, intercellular signaling molecules (eicosanoids) (39) . These lipids participate in an oxidative stress response and are hypothesized to play a role in the heat stress response in symbiotic cnidarians (40) . Finally, acyl-CoA synthetase longchain family member 4 was up-regulated. This enzyme converts ARA to arachidonoyl-CoA, which is an important player in cellular oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death (41) .",

                "text": "Ecological Implications. The idea that the capacity to change hostsymbiont combinations could provide a punctuated and accelerated ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions has been a controversial and much-discussed area of cnidarian symbiosis for several decades (e.g., ref. 51). Overall, animals harboring the novel symbiont S. trenchii show evidence of immunoresistance and heterotrophy, in contrast to the immunotolerance and symbiont-derived nutrition displayed in S. minutum-colonized animals. These patterns are consistent with previous studies of host cnidarians colonized with S. trenchii that have shown attenuated productivity and slower growth of the association and, in the case of calcifying organisms, reduced coral reef accretion (52) . Such physiological trade-offs cast doubt on the ability of thermally tolerant clade D Symbiodinium to ameliorate the effects of climate change (22) . The strong shifts in host immunologic and metabolic pathways described here indicate that to establish successful long-term symbioses, novel symbionts must overcome considerable challenges at the cellular and organismal levels. Furthermore, the ecological relevance of novel associations will depend on whether the symbiont provides any functional benefit to the coral's physiology, beyond the capacity to simply form an association with a new host (53) . Thus, the capability of novel symbionts to increase coral resilience to climate change will require each to run a gauntlet of host immune responses while balancing the exchange of multiple metabolite classes of functional significance, all while experiencing increasingly severe environmental stress. Confirming our observations in reef corals, not in the least to establish whether calcification has any impact on the pathways described, is critical to fully elucidate how coral reef communities may respond to a changing climate.",

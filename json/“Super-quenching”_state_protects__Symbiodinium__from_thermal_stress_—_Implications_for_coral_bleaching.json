Corals consist of a complex and fragile symbiosis between an animal host (phylum Cnidaria) and endosymbiotic microalgae (dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium). Dinoflagellate photopigments (chlorophylls (Chl) a, c 2; and carotenoids) give the coral an overall brown coloration, but a range of host pigments combine to produce the colorful array of species we see across a coral reef. Prolonged exposure of corals to high irradiance and an elevated seawater temperature, ~1-2\u00baC above the summer average, induces pigment degradation and/or triggers the release of the Symbiodinium photosymbiont from the host [1] , which in turn causes uncovering of the white skeleton underlying the animal tissue (coral bleaching). The bleaching phenomenon is often followed by death of the coral [1, 2] . In this respect, the health of the coral holobiont is critical for the survival of corals and therefore of coral reefs and their denizens. However, global climate changes (especially the rising ocean temperature and ocean acidification) are threatening the health of this symbiotic relationship worldwide [2] [3] [4] . Current predictions indicate that coral reefs may face extinction by 2050 [3, 4] .",

In higher plants, the thylakoid membranes form tightly appressed, stacked regions (grana) connected by single stroma thylakoids, due to the inter-membrane interaction of the PSII peripheral light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). This thylakoid ultrastructure enforces strict lateral separation of PSII and PSI between the grana and the stroma membrane regions respectively, which does not allow for intersystem excitation energy transfer (known as \"spillover\" in the literature) [13] . In contrast, the thylakoids of dinoflagellates, as in many microalgae [14] , are loosely grouped in threes which allows mixing of PSII and PSI units and thus spillover.",

Initially, the usual kinetic scheme of unconnected PSII and PSI primary processes that were successful in describing the kinetics of both control and high light stressed higher plants [28] as well as diatoms [19] were tested (SI, Fig. S2A ). However, such a kinetic scheme was grossly unsuitable to describe the data of Symbiodinium cells under any of the experimental conditions. All modifications of the unconnected PSII and PSI reaction schemes resulted in unsuccessful model fits. The kinetic schemes that successfully fit the data are summarized in Fig. 3 . Consequently, connected schemes were tested by introducing a rate constant k so accounting for a process -traditionally called \"spillover\"by which PSII transfers excitation energy to PSI (SI, Fig. S2B ). Since efficient excited state energy transfer occurs over relatively short distances (typically \u2264 20-30\u00c5) [32] , spillover from PSII to PSI is possible only if direct contact of the two antenna systems within the same membrane exists. Such a direct contact appears feasible in Symbiodinium due to the loose packing of the thylakoids (Fig. 2 and [14, 33] ), which could strongly reduce PSII-PSI segregation as compared to higher plants. Introduction of spillover into the model did indeed allow for an excellent description of the high-temperature conditions with or without additional light stress (F B and F HT , correspondingly). However, the kinetic model was still not suitable for the description of the control (F C ) and high-light (F HL )",

For both PSII populations, light-stress caused a strong increase in the direct antenna deactivation rate k NPQ (from a dark-adapted value of 0.35 ns -1 to 2.6 ns -1 and 1.5 ns -1 respectively, for spillover and non-spillover PSII units).

This explained the increase in the relative absorption cross-section of PSI in comparison to control temperature conditions (from ~50% to about ~65-70%, Table 1 ). These effects were obvious in F HT but became even more pronounced in F B . Our results are consistent with recent studies of Hoogenboom et al. [40] and Hill et al. [16] , which also indicated the presence of a mobile LHC pool moving between PSII and PSI depending on temperature. Under temperature stress conditions the drastically reduced overall PSII average lifetimes are explained by two effects: i) the very high spillover rates from PSII to PSI; and, ii) the increased antenna deactivation rate, k NPQ .

The TEM pictures (Fig. 2) obtained for high temperature incubations show a trend for loss of the typical thylakoid arrangement in dinoflagellates. Such an effect has been observed previously for longer heat stress exposures [30, 31] . Unfortunately, very little is known about the arrangement of pigmentprotein complexes in the thylakoid membranes of dinoflagellates, thus no data exist about the PSI/PSII distribution along the thylakoid membranes. However, the arrangement of the photosynthetic complexes in the thylakoid membranes and their rearrangement induced by stress factors can be deduced by spectroscopic methods. Indeed, our fluorescence data (Figs. 3 and 4) show that under normal conditions (F C ), there exist two PSII pools: one involved in spillover to PSI (predominantly located in the non-appressed membrane regions) and another (predominantly located in the appressed regions and thus laterally segregated from PSI) that does not exchange excitation energy with PSI (Fig. 3A) . Hence, the strict PSII-PSI segregation, typical for higher plant thylakoids, is not realized in Symbiodinium under non-stressed control conditions (F C ). The effect can be well understood considering the low degree of membrane appression in",

Previously this was attributed primarily to a damage of PSII units (e.g. photoinhibition etc. [23, 47] ); however, the actual occurrence of photoinhibition has been questioned [30] . Our results can explain all these previous data in terms of the functional loss of PSII activity, without actually requiring an initial damage of PSII units. The total loss of PSII/PSI segregation and the shift of part of the PSII peripheral antennae (15-20%) to PSI under heat stress switches the PSA into the \"super-quenching\" state, where less than 5% of all the photons absorbed by the PSII antenna cause electron transfer, while more than 95% are converted into heat. Therefore, all the kinetic parameters of the PSII units in this state indicate an intact electron transfer capability. Yet, the strong spillover has the same effect of strongly reducing the PSII yield, measured as F v /F m , just as a real damage of PSII centers would do. This explains why the two entirely different mechanisms cannot be distinguished in the conventional steady-state fluorescence measurements. Overall, under combined heat and light stress conditions, the linear electron flow in the entire PSA breaks downs, along with all the ensuing negative consequences for adenosine-5'-triphosphate synthesis and carbon fixation that have been reported as characteristics of the coral symbionts under bleaching conditions [5, 6, 16] .",

In preparation for the picosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements, algae were concentrated using a centrifuge at 1000 g for 10 min; the supernatant was discarded and algae were resuspended in 1 L of fresh f/2 medium to a cell concentration of ~10000-15000 cells/ml. During the experiments, the algae were continuously stirred to keep them in a homogenous suspension and monitored for aggregation on the reservoir walls. To prevent clumping of the algae culture, which created a problem with the flow-through cuvette, the sample reservoirs were treated for short periods of time in an ultrasound bath at 80 W (Sonorex Digitec DT 100/H, Bandelin, Germany) at random intervals during the experimental runs.

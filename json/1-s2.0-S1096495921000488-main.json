    "abstract": "Coral polyps host intracellular symbiotic dinoflagellates (SD). The loss of SD (referred as bleaching) under stressful environmental conditions is the main reason of coral reef destruction, and therefore, intensively studied over the world. Lipids are the structural base of biomembranes and energy reserve of corals and are directly involved in the coral bleaching. In order to establish a relationship between coral tissue morphology, physiological processes and lipidome dynamics during bleaching, the soft coral Sinularia heterospiculata was exposed to experimental heat stress (33 \u2022 C) for 72 h. A chlorophyll content, structure of cells, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and molecular species of storage and structural lipids were analyzed. After 24 h of heat exposure, the level of ROS-positive SD cells did not increase, but the host tissues lost a significant part of SD. The removal of SD cells by exocytosis were suggested. Exocytosis was presumed to prevail at earlier stages of the soft coral bleaching. Symbiophagosomes with degenerative SD were observed in the stressed coral host cells. After 24 h, the content of phosphatidylinositols, which involved in apoptosis and autophagy, was significantly decreased. The innate immune response was triggered, and SD were digested by the coral host. After 48 h, a degradation of SD chloroplasts and a decrease in the specific monogalactosyldiacylglycerol molecular species were detected that confirmed a disruption of lipid biosynthesis in chloroplasts. At the end of coral bleaching, the appearance of oxidized phosphatidylethanolamines, indicating damage to the host membranes, and the degradation of the coral tissues were simultaneously observed. Thus, a switch between dominant mechanisms of the SD loss during bleaching of S. heterospiculata was found and proved by certain variations of the lipidomic profile. Lipidomic parameters may become indicators of physiological processes occurring in the symbiotic coral organism and may be used for assessing anthropogenic or natural destructive effects on coral reefs.",

Most coral species are symbiotic animals that involve intracellular symbiotic dinoflagellates (SD) or zooxanthellae (Davy et al., 2012) . The existence of symbiotic coral polyps depends on SD that photosynthesize the nutrients essential to the host (Muscatine, 1967) . The loss of SD, and consequent loos in color, occurs when seawater temperature exceed 32 \u2022 C. This process is known as coral bleaching (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007) . Mass coral bleaching is usually associated with global warming (Hughes et al., 2003) .",

                "text": "The process of bleaching begins in SD chloroplasts. Increased temperature and high levels of solar radiation cause photoinhibition and damage to chloroplasts and photosynthetic apparatus of symbiotic cells following by accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to the bleaching cascade (Lesser, 2006; Venn et al., 2008) . ROS can be generated not only in chloroplasts but in mitochondria and peroxisomes of both zooxanthellae and host cells (Weis, 2008) . ROS can trigger second messenger systems (Szab\u00f3 et al., 2020) . When ROS are accumulated, they diffuse through the plasma membrane of the zooxanthellae and enter the cytoplasm of the host gastrodermis cell (Tchernov et al., 2004; Lesser, 2006) , damaging cell components as lipids (Lesser and Farrell, 2004; Richier et al., 2005; Noctor et al., 2018) , which could be a trigger for the loss of symbionts by exocytosis (Suggett et al., 2008; Gustafsson et al., 2014) . In situ degradation of symbionts and apoptosis or necrosis of symbiosoms was shown to be another mechanism for the zooxanthellae loss (Weis, 2008; Szab\u00f3 et al., 2020) . Bleaching may be considered as a process of detection and elimination of opportunistic pathogenic zooxanthellae by the coral host (Weis, 2008) . The symbionts indicate their presence during photoinhibition by the production of ROS, and the host cells, in turn, triggers an immune response by producing NO, leading to the destruction of zooxanthellae in situ (Fang, 2004; Gruenberg and van der Goot, 2006; Perez and Weis, 2006) . Degradation of zooxanthellae by autophagy at coral bleaching has been previously confirmed by Dunn et al. (2007) . Stress induces maturation of lysosomes and their fusion with symbiosoms that may result in the digestion of symbionts (Chen et al., 2005) . The described mechanisms for the zooxanthellae loss are reliably confirmed, but the predominance of each mechanism over others under certain conditions is not completely clear.",

To cope with the increased temperature, SD uses several strategies including alteration of the membrane lipid structure. The increased heat resistance of thermotolerant SD Durusdinium trenchii may be directly related to the higher DGDG/MGDG ratios even in the absence of heat stress, as opposed to thermosensitive SD Cladocopium C3 (Rosset et al., 2019) . The amount of saturated SQDG and the degree of unsaturation of MGDG and DGDG in D. trenchii were higher than those in Cladocopium C1/C3 (Sikorskaya et al., 2021) . The long-term exposure to an increased temperature led to a decrease in the relative amount of C 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in lipids of both SD clades, but the visible thermal threshold of changes in lipids was lower in Cladocopium C1 (Kneeland et al., 2013) . A holobiont heat sensitivity also depends on the coral host ( (Dunn et al., 2004; Lesser and Farrell, 2004; Sammarco and Strychar, 2013) . Phospholipids are the structural base of the host cells and some phospholipid classes are essential for the animal physiology. Translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) within cellular membrane is known to be an indicator of apoptosis (Elmore, 2007) .

Heterogenic cell suspensions isolated from corals were divided into two equal parts. One part was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min, resuspended in 90 \u03bcL of annexin-binding buffer (calcium-and magnesium-free artificial seawater (CMFSW) containing 2.5 mM CaCl 2 ). Annexin V is a phosphatidylserine-binding protein, and its complex with FITC is used for detection of PS translocation to the outer membrane surface of apoptotic cells (Elmore, 2007) . The PS in intact live cells is restricted to the inner leaflet of the membrane (Arur et al., 2003) . The cells were stained with 10 \u03bcL of Annexin V-FITC solution (Invitrogen, USA) (to detect apoptotic cells) and SYTOX\u2122 Red (Invitrogen) at the final concentration of 5 nM (for staining the nuclei of dead cells with damaged membranes), and incubated for 45 min at room temperature (RT) in the dark. The suspension of cells was then diluted with 150 \u03bcL of annexin-binding buffer, centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and re-suspended in 250 \u03bcL of annexin-binding buffer followed by flow cytometry. The second part of heterogenic cell suspension was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and re-suspended in 100 \u03bcL of CMFSW. 2 \u2032 ,7 \u2032 -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H 2 DCFDA) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (used for the ROS detection) at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM and SYTOX\u2122 Red at the final concentration of 5 nM were added to the cells and incubated at RT for 45 min in the dark. The cell suspension was then diluted with 150 \u03bcL of CMFSW, centrifuged at 500g for 5 min, and re-suspended in 250 \u03bcL of CMFSW followed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometrical analyses were conducted within 20 min after staining using a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) connected to a computer running CytExpert software (version 2.3, Beckman-Coulter). In flow cytometry, an \"event\" is defined as a single particle (cell fragment, single cell or aggregated cells) detected by the instrument. The sequential exclusion of cell aggregates and debris from an analysis of cytometrical data is required for the obtaining of reliable results. Single events made up more than 90% of total events in each sample and were determined by triangle gating on FSC-A against FSC-H plot in order to exclude cell aggregates from the following analysis. Single events possessing autofluorescence at excitation 488 nm and emission at 690/50 BP were considered as chlorophyll-positive algal cells (zooxanthellae), while other cells were considered as host cells. The proportion of chlorophyllpositive cells is presented as a percentage of the total single events. H 2 DCFDA-positive (both zooxanthellae and host) cells or Annexin V-FITC-positive host cells were detected at 488 nm excitation and 525/40 BP emission. SYTOX\u2122 Red-positive host cells were detected at 638 nm excitation and 660/10 BP emission.",

After fixing, the material was washed in buffer and fixed in 1% OsO 4 in cacodylate buffer. Decalcification was carried out for 2 days in a solution of ascorbic acid (Dietrich and Fontaine, 1975) . Samples were dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol and acetone and embedded in Araldite. Sections were cut with glass knives on an ultratome Ultracut UC6 (Leica, Germany). Ultrathin (60-75 nm) sections were collected on copper grids after staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a Carl Zeiss Libra 120 transmission electron microscope or a Carl Zeiss Sigma 300 Vp scanning electron microscope equipped with a STEM-detector. The microscopic studies were performed at the \"Far Eastern Center of Electron Microscopy\" (National Scientific Center of Marine Biology, Far Eastern Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, Vladivostok, Russia).",

The epidermis consisted of disordered clusters of granular amebocytes and myoepithelial cells with the signs of differentiation lost (Fig. 1D ). Myoepithelial cells lost contact with each other and the basal lamina, were round, lost microvilli and the myofibril-containing part of the cytoplasm in the form of structures with disintegrated myofibrils (Fig. 1F, G) . Most epithelial cells had signs of degradation. Their cytoplasm contained the remains of secretory granules, autophagosomes and residual bodies. Necrotic-like epidermal cells were detected in phagosomal vacuoles and cytoplasm of granular amoebocytes (Fig. 1J) . The amoebocytes had a winding plasma membrane and contained myelin-like bodies (Fig. 1H) . A decrease in the number of SD was noticed in gastrodermis (Fig. 1B) . Some of them were removed by exocytosis into the external environment. Almost all remaining zooxanthellae had signs of apoptosis ( Fig. 2C ; 3B, C). SD were not tightly attached to the host membrane; an increase in the volume of the vacuolar matrix in the symbiosome was observed. The most significant structural degradation was detected in chloroplasts: they lost a clear elongated shape at early and mid apoptosis (Fig. 3B ). Chloroplast sites merged to form larger and rounded organelle bodies. The structure of thylakoids was disturbed. Clusters of pigmentprotein complexes appeared in the stromal gaps between thylakoid grana (Fig. 3F ). Thylakoids were partially destroyed or lost their parallel arrangement and close contacts with each other in grana (Fig. 3G) . Disintegrated thylakoid membranes and pigment-protein clusters randomly filled the chloroplast stroma. The disappearance of clear parallel gaps between the grana in the stroma was observed. At the same time, the fragmentation of chloroplasts occurred (Fig. 3H) . Compact fragments were enveloped by an adjacent chloroplast membrane, condensed, and formed electron-dense rounded apoptotic bodies. The number of apoptotic bodies increased at the late apoptosis (Fig. 3C) . Chloroplast lamellae were sometimes detected as \"free-floating\" cells in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3N ). Apoptotic bodies, smaller than that at chloroplast destruction, were formed after mitochondria fragmentation (Fig. 3H ). Chromatin structure changes occurred in the nuclei. Many cells had despiralized chromosomes and condensed (or, at the late apoptosis, fragmented) interchromosomal chromatin (Fig. 3J, K) . The nuclear membrane of some cells was damaged. The number of electrondense spots of different diameter increased in the accumulation body (Fig. 3N) . Lipid droplets were rare and had a loose heterogeneous structure (Fig. 3O ). Plastoglobules were slightly larger and denser than the normal ones (Fig. 3P) . The number of glyoxysomes was visually increased compared with the control animal tissues.",

A three-fold decrease in the chlorophyll-positive cell proportion of total cells and a halving of the chlorophyll a content in coral tissues indicated a considerable loss of SD and a decrease of photosynthetic function of S. heterospiculata within 24 h after the beginning of temperature increase. Contrary to chlorophyll a, the content of chlorophyll b did not change. Chlorophyll b is the second most abundant chlorophyll in algae. If chlorophyll a is found in the reaction centers and light harvesting antenna complexes (LHC) of photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII), then chlorophyll b is found in the LHC's and as accessory pigments of PSII (Willows, 2020).

According to TEM data, the epidermal structure of the tentacles of S. heterospiculata was broken down after 48-h heat exposure. According to flow cytometric and lipidomic analysis, the proportion of necrotic host cells significantly increased, whereas the levels of all lipids critically reduced and the structural lipid profile of the host considerably fluctuated by the end of the experiment. Oxidized phospholipids (oxPE and oxPS) appeared at 48-h point and its content reached 16% of the structural lipids at 72-h point. In our previous experiment, oxPE reached 24% to the end of the experimental bleaching of soft coral Sinularia sp. (Sikorskaya et al., 2020) . Oxidized phospholipids can serve as a signal for immune cells of terrestrial animals (Serbulea et al., 2017) , but the lipid class giving one fifth of the total structural lipids should not be considered as a \"signal\" molecule class. The considerable number of oxidized phospholipids disrupts the structure of cell membranes, because oxidized acyl chains are turned into the aquatic environment. The sharp decrease in the level of ROS-positive host cells at the end of the experiment may be resulted from an intensive utilization of ROS for the oxPE and oxPS synthesis (Farmer and Mueller, 2013; O'Donnell et al., 2019) . Most likely, the recovery of the coral becomes impossible, when damaged cells were over accumulated.",

At the same time, the content of total structural lipids declined but the proportions between the major structural phospholipid classes (PC/PE/PS/CAEP/LPE) were quite stable. It means that S. heterospiculata can turn on the mechanisms of energy accumulation for future recovery and keep the structure of biological membranes. If the heat stress continues, a considerable amount of storage lipids is utilized, a hydrolytic and oxidase degradation of the storage lipids increases like an avalanche, cell structures are destroyed, and coral colonies die.",

Exocytosis is assumed to predominate during the first day (earlier stage) of the soft coral bleaching. Then, within 24-48 h of heat exposure, the remaining degraded zooxanthellae were destroyed by the coral host innate immune system, which leads to their intracellular digestion. Necrosis and degradation of the coral cells and tissues were observed at the end of the experiment. The relationships between lipidome and each process accompanying coral bleaching were found, but requires further research. We believe that lipidomic parameters may become reliable indicators of physiological processes occurring in the coral symbiotic organism.",

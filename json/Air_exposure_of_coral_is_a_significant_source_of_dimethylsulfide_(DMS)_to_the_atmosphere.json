DMSP is produced by both the algal endosymbiont Symbiodinium 4, 5 and coral host which, together with the breakdown products DMS and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), has many eco-physiological roles in coral reef ecosystems, including infochemistry in organisms from bacteria to fish, and stress protection [7] [8] [9] [10] . Coral-associated DMS production stems from complex interactions in the coral 'holobiont' -the combination of coral polyp, endosymbiotic algae and associated microbial community. Importantly, a large proportion of microbes associated with corals are capable of cycling DMSP and DMS, and these compounds play important roles in structuring the bacterial community 6, 11 . However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms of DMS production by the coral holobiont and DMS fluxes to the atmosphere from reef environments remain poorly quantified.",

High intracellular concentrations of DMSP in Symbiodinum sp 5 . coupled with the capacity of DMS and DMSO to diffuse into photosynthetic membranes provides an effective protection mechanism against oxidative stressors 12 . Diffusion across membranes inevitably results in significant release of DMS into the surrounding seawater. Both laboratory and field studies demonstrate strong associations between environmental factors driving oxidative stress (e.g. high light, hyposalinity, high pCO 2 ) and elevated DMSP, DMS and DMSO in pelagic microalgae [12] [13] [14] , benthic macroalgae [15] [16] [17] [18] , and corals 8, 10 . Recent evidence also demonstrates that DMSP appears to be upregulated by corals during recovery from a thermally-induced bleaching event . At low tide, corals experience high temperature and light levels, air exposure, desiccation and hypoxia . Such conditions are likely to induce stress-related production of DMS(P)-rich mucus by the coral, resulting in elevated DMS concentrations in the over-lying atmosphere 20, 21 . Indeed, the few observations of atmospheric DMS from reef environments suggest a link between enhanced atmospheric concentrations and low tide events 20, 22, 23 . Of particular note are the observations from an atoll in the Florida Keys, where atmospheric DMS increased three orders of magnitude during a tidal cycle -from ~0.01 ppb at high tide up to 19 ppb downwind of the reef at low tide 24 .",

We describe a series of novel laboratory experiments under controlled temperature and light conditions exposing three common Indo-Pacific scleractinian coral species (Acropora cf. horrida, Seriatopora hystrix, Porites cylindrica) to air for short periods and subsequent re-submersion. Measurements of atmospheric DMS (DMS gas ), seawater DMS, DMSP, DMSO and Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) were made before, during and after each exposure. Together, our results revealed a marked response in coral sulfur cycling and photophysiological condition that carry important implications both for estimates of sulfur emissions to the tropical/sub-tropical atmosphere and for our understanding of how corals respond to environmental fluctuations.",

Ramets were followed throughout experimental design and selected from different genets to ensure biological replication for each treatment. At the beginning of experiments, coral nubbins (ramets) were transferred within a few seconds from the acclimation tank to 3 \u00d7 870 mL glass flasks (n = 3 or 4 nubbins per flask) with gas-tight lids and fully covered (submersed; Stage I) in 500 mL seawater from a 1000 L tropical aquarium. The number of nubbins used was dependent on the number that could be placed inside the flask without the nubbins touching each other or the flask walls. Each flask was positioned within a temperature-controlled water bath at \u00b0C illuminated by 54 W fluorescent tubes (Lightwave T5, Growth Technology, UK) delivering ~300 \u03bc mol photons/m /s within each flask.",

It was ensured that neither the tubing nor the bubble stream came into contact with the coral nubbins. Flasks were left for 1 h to approach constant DMS concentrations where net biological production by the coral holobiont was balanced by removal of DMS due to bubbling. Coral nubbins were subsequently exposed to air (air exposure; Stage II) by removing seawater from the flasks. The mean exposure time for all experiments (32.7 \u00b1 11.7 min) falls within the range of tidal exposure times of 15-105 min experienced in a natural reef environment . After exposure, flasks were re-filled with the same seawater that had been removed (re-submersed; Stage III). When the coral nubbins were (re-)submersed, rising bubbles fully equilibrated with seawater DMS (see Discussion) and exited in the waste air stream.

                "text": "This initial spike in DMS gas during air exposure is expected since DMS is now directly emitted into the gas phase rather than first into the water phase. DMS is very soluble -the dimensionless solubility of DMS (water phase concentration:gas phase concentration) is 11.4 at 26 \u00b0C 33 . Thus at equilibrium during (re-)submersion, the surrounding seawater acts as a DMS 'reservoir' with ca. 95% of the DMS by mole residing in the water phase at a given time. When the water is removed, DMS produced by the corals is directly emitted into the gas phase, resulting in high DMS gas within the first minutes after air exposure. After the initial spike, DMS gas steadily decreased during the subsequent 12 minutes and returned to near baseline levels. We estimate the exponential decay in DMS gas due to flushing with DMS-free compressed air (red dashed line in Fig. 1 ). Air dilution can account for essentially all of the DMS gas decrease during minutes 12 to 24, which suggests that after the first few minutes of air exposure, there is very limited additional DMS emission from the corals (which would cause observed DMS gas to be above the modeled air dilution line). We note that this observation does not imply zero DMS production from the coral holobiont upon air exposure. DMS production likely continues leading to the initial spike in DMS gas , but is then trapped by the mucus layer that quickly forms on the coral surface upon exposure (see Discussion). We repeated the experiment with nubbins of A. cf. horrida ( Fig. 2A) , and with nubbins of two further species: Porites cylindrica ( Fig. 2B ) and Seriatopora hystrix (Fig. 2C ). Air exposure of all species resulted in about an order of magnitude increase in DMS gas . DMS gas averaged from the first 10 minutes of air exposure varied among the different coral species: A. cf. horrida gave the highest value of 3.4 \u00b1 0.3 ppm (1262 \u00b1 213 pmol/cm 2 ), while the other species yielded less than 1 ppm (< 100 pmol/cm ). Both raw DMS gas concentrations and zooxanthellae cell density-normalised DMS concentrations yielded the same trends (Table 1 and Figure S1 ). Again, this may be a reflection of the variability in tissue DMSP content between the tested species (Table S1 ). It is worth noting that we did not perform our experiments at light levels likely to be encountered in the reef environment (700\u03bc mol photons/m /s) 34 to see whether or not DMS production is further enhanced under these conditions. However, we did perform a further experiment in the dark with two flasks holding A. cf. horrida and two flasks holding A. cf. horrida 400 (n = 3 nubbins per flask). The same response was seen during air exposure, with DMS gas reaching maxima that ranged from 0.8-4 ppm across four experimental flasks, compared to 0.1-1.5 ppm during submersion ( Figure S2 ). No significant differences in DMS gas were detectable between A. cf. horrida 100 and A. cf. horrida 400 .",

Unlike the transition from submersion to air exposure, the initially high DMS gas after re-submersion is opposite to the expected solubility-driven response when moving from air to water. Instead, our observations imply high concentrations of DMS in the seawater when the coral is first re-submersed. This could be due to rapid production of DMS by the coral holobiont. Alternatively, if substantial DMS was trapped in the mucus during air exposure (Stage II), re-submersing the coral in seawater could result in dissolution and liberation of the DMS trapped in mucus. The subsequent decrease in DMS gas is driven by biological processes associated with the presence of coral, with water-to-air emission accounting for only a quarter of the DMS loss (see Discussion).",

Photosynthetic downregulation was identified by a temporary decrease in the effective absorption cross-section (\u03c3 \u00b4) (Table S2 ) and the operating efficiency of photosystem II (F q '/F m ') in conjunction with an increased photosynthetic electron turnover time (\u03c4 \u00b4) ( Fig. 2D-F) . This is in contrast to photo-damage by reactive oxygen species that results in a sustained increase in \u03c3 \u00b4 and/or \u03c4 \u00b4 coupled with a decrease in F q '/F m ' 35, 36 . The FRRf-derived response of A. cf. horrida 400 indicated that photosynthesis downregulated during air exposure but consistently recovered upon re-submersion, suggesting no prolonged down-regulation that would result from photo-damage ( Fig. 2D) . P. cylindrica and S. hystrix 100 responded similarly to A. cf. horrida 400 , but showed less recovery in F q '/F m ' , which remained below the level measured before air exposure ( Fig. 2E,F , Table S2 ). The full recovery of F q '/F m ' by A. cf. horrida suggests a greater tolerance to the physiological stress of transient air exposure compared to the other species tested here. Acroporids are well reported to thrive in intertidal zones that experience prolonged (> 3.5 h) periods of exposure during spring tides . Furthermore, there is evidence that specimens adapted to such variable environments show greater physiological tolerance to thermal stress 38, 39 . Thus Acroporids may possess physiological mechanisms that instil tolerance to a range of environmental conditions. Seawater sulfur dynamics after coral re-submersion. To explore the roles of dimethylated sulfur compounds as anti-oxidants, we measured the seawater concentrations of DMS, dissolved DMSO (DMSO d ) and total aqueous phase DMSP (DMSP t ) at regular intervals after re-submersion of A. cf. horrida 400 in a separate experiment (Fig. 3) . Here, 3 x A. cf. horrida nubbins were transferred to a single flask and subjected to a 15 min air exposure, before the flask was re-filled with seawater. In contrast to all other experiments, the flask was not flushed with air (i.e. minimal water-to-air emission of DMS). Abiotic photochemical loss of DMS, inferred from previous measurements from the Sargasso Sea 40 , is also slow (at most 0.006/h). Rapid changes occurred during the first 10 minutes, corresponding to a rate constant for net DMS loss of about 3.7/h, which we can largely attribute to coral-related biological processes as follows: After 20 minutes, DMS levels had decreased by 120 nM (equivalent to 1.0 nmol/cm 2 , based on the mean surface area (41.9 \u00b1 27.8 cm 2 per nubbin, see Table S3 ) of 3 x A. cf. horrida fragments). Simultaneously, DMSO d increased by 175 nM (1.4 nmol/cm 2 ). We see that the net increase in DMSO concentration (the principal oxidation product of DMS) was 55 nM higher than the net decrease in DMS concentration. Using a simplistic mass balance where no DMSO is directly released by the coral, 100% of DMS is converted to DMSO, and DMSO loss is negligible, Fig. 3 suggests a gross DMS production of 55 nM (175-120 nM) and a gross DMS consumption (converted to DMSO) of 175 nM over the 20 minutes. Within the first 10 minutes after re-submersion when the rates were the highest, this corresponds to a gross DMS production rate of 300 nM/h and a gross DMS consumption rate of 840 nM/h. Of course, less than unity conversion from DMS to DMSO is likely , as well as significant consumption of DMSO 42, 43 , which together would imply greater DMS gross consumption. On the other hand, any direct coral emission of DMSO would reduce the DMS gross consumption required for mass balance (at the limit of no DMS production, DMS gross consumption = DMS net consumption = 540 nM/hr within the first 10 minutes).",

                "text": "We developed a simple box model in order to explore the plausible bounds of biological DMS production and consumption. As an independent measure, we used the biological consumption rate derived from the no-bubbling experiment (Fig. 3) to model the decay in DMS a few minutes after re-submersion of A. cf. horrida nubbins (n = 3 in a single flask) in a separate experiment (Fig. 4) . The coral nubbins had been subjected to 15 minutes of air exposure before re-submersion and the airside mixing ratio was measured at a high temporal resolution by API-CIMS over an hour (Fig. 4) . DMS in the gas phase is expected to be at equilibrium with the water phase during re-submersion. The equations from 44 predict that in our experimental setup (bubble radius < 1 mm, water level height = 20 cm) bubbles should be fully equilibrated with the surrounding DMS sw when they surface. We verified this by adding aqueous DMS standard to 500 mL of coral-free seawater (final concentration = 100 nM) and monitored the rate of decrease due to bubbling (60 mL/min) in a separate test. The observed reduction (grey dash-dotted line in Fig. 4 ) in DMS gas from bubbling fit to an exponential decay: % loss = 100.exp \u22120.01t where t = time in minutes (R 2 = 0.9), which shows excellent agreement with the modelled DMS equilibrium outgassing (red line). Based on this, we convert the API-CIMS gas phase DMS mixing ratio to a waterside concentration (DMS sw , in units of \u03bc M) via the ideal gas law and the Henry's solubility. Our box model (similar to 45 ) consists of a time-dependent representation of DMS outgassing at equilibrium rate (water-gas transfer) as well as biological DMS production and consumption. DMS consumption is modelled as a first order process: seawater DMS concentration (e.g. in units of nM) multiplied by the rate constant for DMS consumption (e.g. in units of 1/hr). DMS production (e.g. in units of nM/hr) is assumed to be independent of the DMS concentration. We initialised the model with the observed DMS sw a few minutes after re-submersion. Similar to previous experiments, elevated DMS sw (~1 \u03bc M) was observed immediately after the coral was re-submersed followed by a gradual decline in concentration to ~0.01 \u03bc M after 60 minutes. The model shows that equilibrium outgassing can only explain about 25% of the total DMS loss within the first 20 minutes after re-submersion. This indicates additional coral-associated loss of DMS sw , similar to Fig. 3 . When the model is run with just production (100 nM/hr), gas exchange, and zero biological consumption (green dashed line in Fig. 4) , the model overestimates DMS sw relative to observations. A consumption-only model run (rate constant of 3.7/hr, with gas exchange but no production; blue dashed line in Fig. 4 ) significantly underestimates. We chose 3.7/hr because it is the rate constant for net consumption in Fig. 3 over the first 10 minutes after re-submersion. A best fit to the observations in Fig. 4 was achieved with a 15 minute pulse of high DMS production (2 \u03bc M/hr, gold dashed line) at the beginning of the experiment, before turning off DMS production, accompanied by constant consumption rate constant of 3.7/hr.",

The role of mucus in H 2 O 2 release is unclear; a previous study reports undetectable levels in mucus from Stylophora pistillata . However, rapid H 2 O 2 release by S. pistillata has been reported to be stimulated by both chemical and physical stressors . The physical and chemical stimuli associated with re-submersion following air exposure could result in a burst of H O 2 production. DMSO is the first product of the aqueous phase reaction between DMS and H O 2 51, 52 , so coincident release of H O 2 could result in rapid oxidation of dissolved DMS to DMSO.",

A net DMS production of 15 \u03bc M/h would be required to achieve ~1 \u03bc M after only four minutes. We noticed that coral re-submersion caused the release of mucus ropes, which typically contain DMS(P) concentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than in seawater . During air exposure, bio-physical mechanisms such as mucus production and/or polyp retraction help to minimise water loss but also limit the cutaneous oxygen supply and potentially cause hypoxia within the tissues . After the first few minutes of air exposure, we did not detect much additional DMS emission so these mechanisms may also restrict the release of DMS when coral is exposed to air, thereby possibly allowing DMS to build up within the mucus. The dissolution of this DMS-rich mucus into the surrounding seawater may contribute to the observed pulse of DMS at the point of re-submersion. We measured the concentration of DMS in mucus and mucus ropes produced by a colony of A. cf. horrida that had been exposed to air for 15 minutes (a separate colony to those used in the main experiments -see SI methods). Concentrations ranged from 279-577 nM in mucus, with a value of 373 nM in a sample of mucus rope (interestingly, mucus similarly collected from P. cylindrica gave undetectable levels of DMS (D.L \u2264 50 nM, see ref. Mucus thickness after 15 min of exposure is estimated to be 0.05 cm, based on a range of 0.01 to 0.1 cm reported for A. millepora . The mean surface area of 3 x A. cf. horrida nubbins used in our study is 125.7 cm 2 (See Table S3 ). Assuming the entire coral fragment develops an even coating of mucus, this gives a volume of mucus (vol mucus ) of 0.006 L. Seawater volume in the flask (vol water ) was 0.5 L. Taking the maximum value of [DMS mucus ] we measured for A. cf. horrida (577 nM) would result in [DMS sw ] of only 7.3 nM, far from the ~1 \u03bc M we measured (Fig. 4) . Using the maximum reported value from the literature of 18665 nM would result in [DMS sw ] of 235 nM. This implies that the spike in DMS concentrations upon submersion is not simply a result of the dissolution of DMS-rich mucus, and instead may be driven by a short-term up-regulation in DMS production by the coral holobiont.",

The coral-to-air flux of DMS (per sea surface area occupied by the coral) from A. cf. horrida was 3-11 mmole/m 2 /day, with lower emissions from other coral species including P. cylindrica and S. hystrix. To put this emission in environmental context requires knowledge of the areal extent and species composition of exposed reef as well as the frequency of exposure (tidal cycle and reef height). The extent of exposed coral reef during low tide events is not well documented but typically includes the reef crest . Frequency of coral exposure is also poorly quantified. As a case study, we use the observations from Heron Island, a well-studied reef at the southern tip of the Great Barrier Reef. The circular reef rim has 15.8% coverage by Acropora colonies and is exposed on average 12 hours per month (~0.5 days per 30 days = ~0.02) 25, 54 . From this, we estimate the long-term average DMS flux from the reef rim as 9-35 \u03bc mol/m 2 /day (i.e. 3-11 mmol/m 2 /day *(0.158)*0.02*1000) by assuming that Acropora on the reef rim are the sole source of DMS and only emit to the atmosphere when exposed to air. This simplistic calculation does not account for the complexity of the reef environment (e.g. the variability in time of exposure that different areas of the reef experience, or the contributions from non-Acropora corals and other symbiotic cnidarians). Furthermore, the experimental exposure times used here (32.7 \u00b1 11.7 min) fall short of maximum exposure times in a natural reef environment (up to > 100 min) 25 . A longer exposure time may result in further deoxygenation of tissues, which upon re-submersion and re-oxygenation 47,48 may be compensated for by an enhanced pulse of DMS production. However, without further data, predicting the effects of increased exposure time on the DMS flux is highly speculative. Thus, our uncertainty in this flux estimate is large and future observations will need to overcome these knowledge gaps to reconcile and scale natural from laboratory-derived fluxes.",

For example, DMSP-rich surface pack ice in Antarctica is estimated to emit DMS to the atmosphere at a few tens of \u03bc mol/m 2 /day 60 . Strong open ocean sea-to-air DMS flux up to \u03bc mol/m 2 /day were measured over a coccolithophore-dominated bloom in the North Atlantic , whilst a flux of 30 \u03bc mol/m 2 /day was seen over a dinoflagellate bloom in the Southern Ocean . Atmospheric DMS was generally less than < 1 ppb over these algal blooms -significantly lower than the mixing ratio of 19 ppb that have been observed downwind of coral reefs . Phytoplankton blooms typically last only days to weeks, with maximum DMS production persisting for a relatively short period, often during the senescent phase . In contrast, tidal exposure of coral reefs may provide a strong regular DMS flux to the atmosphere.",

                "text": "Our experiments show that when water is removed and corals are exposed to air, a solubility effect results in an order of magnitude increase in DMS concentrations in the overlying air in the first few minutes after exposure. This is consistent with observations of elevated DMS in the air above coral reefs following low tides [22] [23] [24] . Re-submersion of coral resulted in another short-lived pulse of DMS, which might be due to a combination of greater DMS production by the coral holobiont and/or dissolution of DMS-rich mucus that may be formed during air exposure. At low tide, corals inhabiting reef flats and crests can experience significant periods of air exposure, subjecting them to thermal stress, high irradiance and desiccation 64, 65 . We propose that DMS production by corals may help to counter the stress associated with cycles of tidal exposure and re-submersion with rapid reoxygenation of tissues. Our data suggest that tidally exposed coral reef rims should be considered important DMS hotspots, in particular where species of Acropora dominate coral communities. Acropora is a highly successful genus contributing to rich species diversity and productivity on coral reefs via their complex architecture and rapid growth 66 . Acropora is also particularly susceptible to major environmental and climatic stressors, which are expected to increase in frequency in the future 67 . Significant changes in Acropora cover could impact upon future biodiversity and productivity associated with coral reefs 66 . Such changes in coral speciation would also have implications for local atmospheric fluxes of DMS 68 . In situ measurements of atmospheric DMS concentrations and coral-to-air DMS fluxes in reef environments at a range of temporal and spatial scales are required to better quantify the importance of DMS in the tropical marine atmospheric chemistry.",

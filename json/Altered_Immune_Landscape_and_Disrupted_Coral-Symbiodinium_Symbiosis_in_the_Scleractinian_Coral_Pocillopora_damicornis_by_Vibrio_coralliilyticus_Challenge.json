    "abstract": "Vibrio coralliilyticus is known to cause coral diseases, especially under environmental perturbation, but its impact on coral physiology and underpinning mechanism is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated cytological, immunological, and metatranscriptomic responses of the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis to V. coralliilyticus infection. The density and chlorophyll content of symbiotic zooxanthellae decreased significantly at 12 and 24 h after Vibrio challenge. The activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, nitric oxide synthase, phenoloxidase (PO), and the activation level of caspase3 all rose significantly in P. damicornis after Vibrio challenge. In the metatranscriptomic analysis, we found 10 significantly upregulated genes in the symbionts at 24 h after the challenge, which were mostly involved in the metabolism of nucleic acid and polysaccharide, and 133 significantly down-regulated symbiont genes, which were mainly related to amino acid catabolism and transport. Meanwhile, 1432 significantly upregulated coral genes were revealed, highly overrepresented in GO terms that are mostly related to the regulation of immune response, the regulation of cytokine production, and innate immune response. Furthermore, at 24 h after Vibrio challenge, 890 coral genes were significantly downregulated, highly overrepresented in four GO terms implicated in defense response. These results in concert suggest that V. coralliilyticus infection triggered the innate immune response including the redox, PO, and apoptosis systems, but repressed the response of the complement system in the scleractinian coral P. damicornis, accompanied by symbiont density decrease and symbiosis collapse through disordering the metabolism of the symbionts. These findings shed light on the molecular regulatory processes underlying bleaching and degradation of P. damicornis resulting from the infection of V. coralliilyticus.",

Scleractinian corals flourish in shallow tropical waters with low and often undetectable concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients, depending on the elaborate coral-Symbiodinium endosymbiosis (Fabina et al., 2013) . The unicellular symbiont lives in the intracellular vacuoles of host gastrodermal cells, and supplies the host coral with indispensable organic nutrients and oxygen through photosynthesis (Loram et al., 2007) . In return the host coral provides inorganic nutrients and carbon dioxide for symbionts. However, due to environmental changes and anthropogenic perturbations, scleractinian corals have been subjected to impacts of frequent and severe diseases over the past decades (Rosenberg and Ben-Haim, 2002) .",

For example, V. alginolyticus has been identified to be the pathogenic agent of Montastraea spp. yellow band disease in Caribbean and Indo-Pacific and Porites andrewsi white syndrome in the South China Sea (Cervino et al., 2008; Zhenyu et al., 2013) . V. coralliilyticus is a coral bleaching pathogen, which was characterized firstly as temperature-dependent pathogen (strain YB1) of scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis (Ben-Haim et al., 2003a) , and therefore has received attention. It has been reported that V. coralliilyticus used dimethylsulfoniopropionate as a chemotaxis and chemokinesis to target the mucus of the coral host (Garren et al., 2014) , and resulted in coral tissue lysis and symbiont density decrease through extracellular proteases (Ben-Haim et al., 2003b) . Furthermore, it has been observed recently that non-virulent V. coralliilyticus induced an \"efficient\" immune response, whereas virulent one caused immuno-suppression in the coral host (Vidal-Dupiol et al., 2014) . However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis process of V. coralliilyticus to scleractinian corals, especially for symbiosis collapse, remain relatively poorly understood and underexplored particularly by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing technology.",

The components of Toll-like receptor-to-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway have been identified, and their immune-related functions have also been confirmed (Libro et al., 2013; Poole and Weis, 2014; Williams et al., 2018 ). The redox system, phenoloxidase (PO) system, complement system, antimicrobial peptide, apoptosis, and autophagy of scleractinian coral all have been thought to be involved in the killing and elimination of pathogenic microbes (Palmer et al., 2011; Vidal-Dupiol et al., 2011a; Brown et al., 2013; Fuess et al., 2017) .

The gene expression level was analyzed using StringTie software, and the counts of mapped reads for each coral and symbiont gene were further fed into the DESeq2 software to identify differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Tables S1, S2) . Out of the 38,951 genomically predicted coral genes, 36,534 and 36,306 genes (more than three reads) were detectable in the control and Vibrio challenge groups, respectively.

After library calibration, the expression levels of these genes were compared between the control and Vibrio challenge groups.

This is consistent with a previous report that the infection of V. coralliilyticus YB1 caused the decline of density (cell g \u22121 of tissue) and chlorophyll content (chlorophyll a, \u00b5g g \u22121 of tissue) of symbionts in P. damicornis, eventually leading to coral bleaching and lysis (Ben-Haim et al., 2003b) . The similar results suggest that the challenge of V. coralliilyticus SCSIO 43001 could also potentially result in symbiosis collapse and coral bleaching through depressing the symbiont density and chlorophyll content. The innate immune response of P. damicornis could be triggered by the infection with pathogen V. coralliilyticus, as previously shown to manifest in the induced significant change of the expression level of immune-related coral genes such as lectin, metal-binding protein, and cysteine protease inhibitor (Vidal-Dupiol et al., 2011b) . Both the innate immune response and symbiosis collapse in P. damicornis as a result of Vibrio challenge suggest a cascade of pathogenic effects from eliciting immune response, decreasing symbiont abundance, and photosynthetic capacity (chlorophyll content), to causing coral bleaching or even degradation. Whether V. coralliilyticus can infect both the coral and Symbiodinium or the effect on Symbiodinium was a secondary impact stemming from the perturbed coral host remains to be further studied in the future.",

To understand the immune response of scleractinian coral against the challenge of V. coralliilyticus, the activities of crucial enzymes in the redox, PO, and apoptosis systems were monitored in P. damicornis. Elevated activities were observed for SOD and NOS at 6 h, PO at 12 h, CAT and caspase3 at 24 h in the Vibrio challenge group relative to the control group, showing that the redox, PO, and apoptosis systems in this scleractinian coral were activated by Vibrio challenge. It also demonstrates that the scleractinian coral could launch full innate immune response against Vibrio infection. Substantial ROS and RNS is produced generally by invertebrate hosts to kill the invaded pathogens once recognized (Nyholm and Graf, 2012) , the production of ROS or RNS in the coral after challenge was not determined in the present study owing to sample operation difficulty. However, we observed the significant rise of the antioxidase and NOS activities, which might further reflect the production of more ROS and RNS in P. damicornis after Vibrio challenge. Furthermore, the induced PO would catalyze the production of insoluble melanin to aid in the encapsulation of invaded pathogenic vibrios, and more caspase3 was activated to trigger apoptosis to eliminate injured coral cells containing vibrios and symbionts. Taken together, these results suggest that the infection of V. coralliilyticus could activate the redox, PO, and apoptosis systems in P. damicornis to initiate the innate immune defense against Vibrio infection. The inductions of these immune components have also been observed in the scleractinian coral under environmental stresses, especially heat stress that causes bleaching (Downs et al., 2002; Mydlarz et al., 2009; Palmer et al., 2011; Tchernov et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2017) . This suggests that the triggered immune response in P. damicornis by Vibrio challenge might be responsible for the decrease in the symbiont density and disruption of the symbiosis between Symbiodinium and the coral. On the other hand, coral immunity is crucial to the metabolism and health of the scleractinian coral, because it can regulate and control bacterial community in coral biofilms (Cardenas et al., 2012; Kvennefors et al., 2012) , and the bacterial community can provide necessary nitrogen and sulfur resources for the growth and reproduction of the coral (Raina et al., 2009; Lema et al., 2012) . Therefore, it was speculated that there was a trade-off between the elimination of a potential pathogen and the maintenance of coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis and beneficial bacteria in the scleractinian coral, and the needed balance can be sensitive to environmental changes. This is supported by the observation that the scleractinian coral was more susceptible to bleaching, accompanied by an improved immune response, when it suffered from heat stress (Mydlarz et al., 2009; Palmer et al., 2010; Kimes et al., 2012) .",

There were more upregulated genes for immune response, including macrophage mannose receptor, Toll-like receptor, NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein and the TNF receptor-associated factor. This indicates that immunity machinery was remolded at the transcriptional level in the scleractinian coral after Vibrio challenge. As a result, the genes of complement components such as C3 and CUB were significantly downregulated. The complement system is an important part of the immune system that enhances the ability of phagocytic cells to clear microbes and attack the pathogen's cell membrane, and multi-components in the complement system had been identified in cnidaria (Kimura et al., 2009) . The expression level of complement C3 as the core component has been shown to respond to bacterial challenge in the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora (Brown et al., 2013) . This demonstrates that the immune ability of the complement system was suppressed in P. damicornis after Vibrio challenge. These results together suggest that the V. coralliilyticus infection can reconfigure the immune landscape, triggering the innate immune response (including the redox, PO, and apoptosis systems), but repressing the response of the complement system in P. damicornis.",

Among the 133 downregulated genes identified, major enriched GO terms were relevant to amino acid catabolism. These altered metabolic pathways were all essential for the maintenance of the symbiont and its symbiosis with the coral host. Similar metabolic alteration of the symbionts has been reported in the other scleractinian corals under heat stress and depth change, which was accompanied by the shift of Symbiodinium genotype (Cooper et al., 2011; Jones and Berkelmans, 2011) . The metabolic changes in the present study might have resulted from the interaction of the two symbiotic partners in response to Vibrio infection. The scleractinian coral needed more organic nutrition from the symbiont to meet the massive demand of immune energy after Vibrio challenge, and the symbiont could not photosynthesize at full capacity because of the excessive oxidative stress and chlorophyll content decline. The odds between the scleractinian coral and Symbiodinium might eventually lead to the collapse of the symbiosis.",

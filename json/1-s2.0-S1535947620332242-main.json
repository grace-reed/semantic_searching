    "abstract": "Shipboard experiments were each performed over a 2 day period to examine the proteomic response of the symbiotic coral Acropora microphthalma exposed to acute conditions of high temperature/low light or high light/low temperature stress. During these treatments, corals had noticeably bleached. The photosynthetic performance of residual algal endosymbionts was severely impaired but showed signs of recovery in both treatments by the end of the second day. Changes in the coral proteome were determined daily and, using recently available annotated genome sequences, the individual contributions of the coral host and algal endosymbionts could be extracted from these data. Quantitative changes in proteins relevant to redox state and calcium metabolism are presented. Notably, expression of common antioxidant proteins was not detected from the coral host but present in the algal endosymbiont proteome. Possible roles for elevated carbonic anhydrase in the coral host are considered: to restore intracellular pH diminished by loss of photosynthetic activity, to indirectly limit intracellular calcium influx linked with enhanced calmodulin expression to impede late-stage symbiont exocytosis, or to enhance inorganic carbon transport to improve the photosynthetic performance of algal symbionts that remain in hospite. Protein effectors of calcium-dependent exocytosis were present in both symbiotic partners. No caspase-family proteins associated with host cell apoptosis, with exception of the autophagy chaperone HSP70, were detected, suggesting that algal loss and photosynthetic dysfunction under these experimental conditions were not due to host-mediated phytosymbiont destruction. Instead, bleaching occurred by symbiont exocytosis and loss of light-harvesting pigments of algae that remain in hospite. These proteomic data are, therefore, consistent with our premise that coral endosymbionts can mediate their own retention or departure from the coral host, which may manifest as \"symbiont shuffling\" of Symbiodinium clades in response to environmental stress.",

Breakdown of this symbiosis in corals under conditions of environmental stress is manifested as bleaching (loss of endosymbionts or photosynthetic pigments), and eventual death of the colony occurs if the association is not re-established, thereby threatening the persistence of coral reef ecosystems. Even if the symbiosis is re-established, growth and reproduction may be impaired for long afterward (1) . Because we are in the midst of alarming losses of coral reefs owing to mounting levels of environmental stress, a much fuller understanding is required to appreciate how coral symbiosis is regulated if we are to predict the impact of environmental change on the future resilience of tropical coral reef ecosystems (2) .",

In order to reside in this intracellular niche, the symbiosome and resident Zx are co-adapted so that symbiotic algae resist phagocytotic digestion and the host allows the transport of essential nutrients and waste products across the symbiosome membrane to sustain the metabolism, growth, and reproduction of the algal endosymbionts, which in turn release photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host for nutrition.",

Additionally, in a differential gene-expression experiment designed to examine the molecular response of the coral Acropora microphthalma to enhanced levels of solar irradiance, we have observed enhanced transcription of a Ca 2\u03e9 -binding, synaptotagmin-like regulator of SNARE protein assembly in solar-exposed colonies during the early stages of coral bleaching (14) .

Yet, evidence for a direct link between oxidative stress and the cytosolic influx of Ca 2\u03e9 required for exocytosis is at best equivocal. Sawyer and Muscatine (19) did not find any change in intracellular Ca 2\u03e9 or host cell detachment in the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella during thermal-induced coral bleaching. However, Fang et al. (10) did observe cytosolic influx of Ca 2\u03e9 at high temperatures consistent with bleaching, although these experiments were performed on symbiont-free cells of the coral Acropora grandis. Likewise, Huang et al. (20) observed cytosolic influx of Ca 2\u03e9 at the onset of bleaching while studying the intact holobiome of A. grandis and ventured that the loss of symbionts from the coral tissue as a result of heat shock could be attributed to an exocytosis mechanism. In the present experiment, we sought proteomic evidence to link elements of the symbiome redox state with molecular processes of coral bleaching in general and the involvement of Ca 2\u03e9 regulation in particular.",

Three mid-sized healthy fragments from this colony were brought to the surface and arranged on plastic-coated metal dish racks. These racks were distributed within a sun-exposed 600-liter tank at a depth of 40 cm in constantly pumped and thermally adjusted water taken from the seawater supply of the Australian Institute of Marine Science ship RV Cape Ferguson. This sampling was repeated three times so that the photobiological response of the colony fragments could be determined on exposure to three different combinations of stress conditions: high light and low temperature using ambient seawater at 26\u00b0C (seawater is usually well mixed in the upper 20 m of the Great Barrier Reef during wintertime turbulence and so would be similar to temperature at the collection depth); high light and high temperature by heating the tank seawater (31\u00b0C max.); and low light with high temperature, again by heating the tank seawater (31\u00b0C max.). In full sunlight, corals received up to 2,000 mol photons m \u03ea2 s \u03ea1 of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) at noon, with an average PAR exposure measured hourly during daylight hours of 466 mol photons m \u03ea2 s \u03ea1 during the day for those corals exposed to high light conditions. For corals that were exposed to low light, a 70% shade cloth filter placed above the tank gave an average exposure of 157 E during the day, which approximates the irradiance at the coral's natural (10 -15 m) habitat. The seawater temperature was adjusted to 31\u00b0C during the day and lowered to 28\u00b0C at night (to approach natural conditions) for high temperature treatments using an inline temperature-controlled, heater/pump device providing 120 l min \u03ea1 of water displacement.",

Unfortunately, although peptides from the high light/high temperature treatment could be annotated (SI Dataset 4: complete proteome), the reliability of data for these expressed peptides could not meet our stringent criteria for quantification, and so data from this harsh treatment were omitted from further empirical consideration. Peptides could be quantified from the other two stress treatments, and these peptides were then grouped according to probable organismof-origin and likely biochemical function by comparison with three relevant peptide databases. The average fold-change of peptides associated with redox state and Ca 2\u03e9 metabolism, including signaling of exocytosis, are shown in Table 1 , for peptides of likely coral host origin, and in Table 2 , for peptides of likely algal symbiont origin. All other peptides where foldchanges could be calculated are given in the supplemental data (SI Dataset 5: coral host peptides, SI Dataset 6: algal symbiont peptides, SI Dataset 7: prokaryote symbionts, SI Dataset 8: eukaryote symbionts). Values \u03fd1 or \u03fe1 indicated either a reduction or increase in tag intensity as compared with the unstressed t \u03ed 0 proteome, a value equal to 1 indicates no change in protein abundance, a value of 0 indicates the presence of a peptide in the unstressed t \u03ed 0 proteome but absence of the peptide in the treatment proteome and N/D indicates presence of a peptide in the treated proteome but absent in the unstressed t \u03ed 0 proteome. Overall, the trends in peptide fold-changes were the same for both the coral host and algal symbiont peptides. In the high temperature/low light treatment, the peptide fold-changes generally increased across the 2-day experiment compared with the unstressed t \u03ed 0 proteome. In contrast, the peptide-fold changes were massive in day 1 as compared with the unstressed t \u03ed 0 proteome in the high light/low temperature treatment, but these changes collapsed by day 2 for all but a few detectable peptides. This pattern in peptide fold-changes was consistent with photosystem II quantum yield measurements, indicating loss of photosynthetic function, and recovery (Yr) occurred more rapidly in the high temperature/low light treatment than did the high light/low temperature treatment.",

We have reported previously a comparison between the photosynthetic responses of four coral species common to the central Great Barrier Reef, including A. microphthalma, conducted concurrently during the course of these experiments (27) . Briefly, the photosynthetic efficiency of the coral endosymbionts declined significantly in all treatments of this experiment, as evinced by reduced maximum effective quantum yields (\u232cF/F m ') 1 of photosystem II. This is consistent with the photophysical dysfunction of algal symbionts that precedes and progresses during coral bleaching. Yet, the rate of photosystem II yield recovery (Yr) showed this decline in photosynthetic efficiency was not consistent across all treatments for all corals examined. Yr determination revealed that A. microphthalma responds as a light tolerant but thermally sensitive species, with bleaching most severe under both high light and high temperature conditions; the degree of bleaching was greatest in the order: high light/high temperature \u03fe high temperature/low light \u03fe high light/low temperature.",

While proteomics has only recently emerged as a powerful tool to examine the molecular physiology of marine symbioses (16, 28 -31) , other biophysical techniques such as in situ pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry are well established to study photosynthetic function, symbiotic dysfunction and recovery in photoautotropic marine symbioses (32). Our pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry data (27) showed a clear stress-induced reduction in the photosynthetic performance of the algal symbionts of A. microphthalma residing in hospite that, together with visual examination of the coral tissues, confirmed that bleaching had occurred under all of the experimental conditions tested. However, the pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry data also showed that there was a measure of recovery in photosynthetic performance in both high light/low temperature and high temperature/low light treatments by t \u03ed 2 for each experiment, which would suggest that although algal symbionts could not be easily observed by gross visual inspection, there must remain a discrete population of viable algae in the host tissues. Bleaching was so rapid under high light/high temperature conditions that quantitative proteomic data could not be obtained for the stressed symbiome. Future experiments may require shorter time intervals between sampling, particularly when examining high light/high temperature conditions. Additionally, the time period from collection of the coral specimens and acclimatization prior to treatment and sampling should be carefully monitored as this may affect the susceptibility of different corals to bleaching.",

Under conditions of high temperature/low light or high light/low temperature treatment, peptides could be quantified and grouped according to probable organism-of-origin and likely biochemical function. Overall, the trends in peptide fold-changes were the same in proteomes attributed to the coral host, algal symbionts, and other coral associates of prokaryotic or eukaryotic origins (SI Datasets 5-8). For the high temperature/low light treatment, peptides generally showed a modest fold increase across the 2 day experiment compared to that of the unstressed control proteome. In contrast, peptide fold-changes for all probable organisms-of-origin were massive at t \u03ed 1 compared to that of the unstressed control proteome in the high light/low temperature treatment; however, these fold-changes collapsed by t \u03ed 2 with all but a few peptides being detectable. These patterns in peptide fold-changes were consistent with a greater decline of Fv/Fm' in the high temperature/low light treatment compared to that of the high light/low temperature treatment. These data suggest that since the same peptides could be quantified in each treatment and that the overall trend in peptide expression was the same in both treatments, then it is possible that the same mechanisms causing symbiotic dysfunction and recovery exist irrespective of the abiotic conditions causing the stress. In conjunction with the foregoing, similar fold-changes in diverse housekeeping proteins in host, Zx and other resident associates were also noted (SI Datasets 5-8) during these stress treatments, which would indicate an overall effect on cell physiological processes (such as protein synthesis) must be taken into account when considering coral resilience to conditions attributed to bleaching.",

We suggest that choloylglycine hydrolase may provide an antioxidant function during coral recovery to replace more common antioxidant enzymes which may have been overwhelmed during extreme conditions of photooxidative stress. The only quantifiable proteins in the algal endosymbiont dataset (Table 2 ) that had antioxidant functions were thiol peroxidases consistent with previous experimental findings (16, 37) . Present also in the quantitative algal symbiont dataset (Table 2 ) was xanthine dehydrogenase, which is a redox-interactive xanthine oxidoreductase enzyme that is converted to xanthine oxidase by reversible sulfhydryl oxidation or by irreversible proteolytic modification (40) . Xanthine oxidase produces uric acid as an end product of purine catabolism. Uric acid is a strong reducing agent that may act as potent antioxidant, and expression of xanthine oxidase was likewise observed in an endosymbiont-enriched fraction of the coral S. pistillata during induced photooxidative stress (16) .",

In this study, both experimental conditions caused a significant decrease in photosynthetic efficiency (27) . Such a decrease in photosynthetic activity causes acidosis at the calicoblastic ectoderm of corals as occurs during darkness (43, 44) . In the coral S. pistillata, transcription of a gene encoding an extracellular carbonic anhydrase was up-regulated twofold during dark conditions at the calicoblastic ectoderm (45) , which is the epithelium facing the skeleton that regulates calcification (46) . In our experiment, carbonic anhydrase showed a 157-fold increase by t \u03ed 1 under conditions of high temperature and low light ( Table 1) . We suggest that this massive increase in carbonic anhydrase expression could be in response to bleached A. microphthalma tissues becoming acidic due to excessive CO 2 imbalance caused by host respiration as occurs naturally at night (33) or under conditions of depressed photosynthetic activity (41) . Although contrary to what occurs in aposymbiotic anemones as compared with symbiotic conspecifics (47) , increased carbonic anhydrase expression does occur normally at night in the scleractinian coral S. pistillata when algal photosynthesis is absent (48) .",

Conversely, it has been shown elsewhere that the intracellular persistence of the Zx-containing symbiosome relies on either the exclusion or retention of small Rab-GTPase (ARF/SAR gene family) proteins, which are regulators of vesicular trafficking essential to cellular transport and docking with specific target membranes (52) . Significantly, symbiosomes of the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella enveloping healthy Symbiodinium were found to contain the stabilizing vesicle-associated membrane protein ApRab5 and lacked detectable levels of downstream effector ApRab7 and ApRab11 protein regulators of lysosome biogenesis (53) , whereas in symbiosomes having thermally impaired zooxanthellae, it was the ApRab5 protein that was missing and the downstream ApRab7 and ApRab11 proteins were present (54) . Collectively, these data show that ApRab5 retention is a feature of host-symbiont communication for healthy symbionts to persist within the symbiosome of host cells and that ApRab5 is an antagonist of phagosomal maturation by the exclusion of downstream ApRab7 and ApRab11 proteins that direct the progression of phagocytosis (55) . Therefore, ApRab arrest of symbiosome maturation is critical for preventing downstream, early-stage liposomal remodeling of the host-derived phagosomal membrane so that Zx-bearing symbiosomes are able to evade recognition by the innate immune system of the host (56) and thereby sustain endosymbiosis. Thus, cellular communication and the crosstalk between Rab proteins and their effectors provide the coordination of endocytic pathways necessary to control organelle homeostasis (57) that in zooxanthellate corals has long been recognized as essential for host regulation of endosymbiont populations, which is central to the stability of the symbiosis.",

                "text": "We have previously reported proteomic evidence for exocytosis as a functional mechanism for the loss of endosymbionts from cnidarian host tissues in coral bleaching (16) . For exocytosis to occur, there must be fusion of the tethered vesicle SNARE (vSNARE) protein with a membrane target SNARE (tSNARE) protein. This happens when Ca 2\u03e9 -bound synaptogamin docks vSNARE and tSNARE proteins to release complexin from the SNARE complex, allowing vesicle fusion and exocytosis to proceed. Premature assembly of vSNARE and tSNARE in the absence of synaptogamin is prevented by calmodulin, which binds free calcium in the cell to clamp SNARE fusion. Rapid exocytosis is triggered by synaptogamin having a greater affinity for calcium than does calmodulin. A drop in intracellular pH of the calicoblastic epithelium and sub-calicoblastic medium has been shown in S. pistillata to reduce calcification upon seawater acidification (58) . However, this treatment evoked only a gradual decrease in intracellular pH suggesting that S. pistillata can regulate its internal pH. It has yet to be determined if a transient shift in pH, perhaps by enhanced carbonic anhydrase activity at the tissue-skeleton interface, would be sufficient to cause CaCO 3 desorption, releasing free Ca 2 \u03e9 that on crossing into the gastrodermis might initiate exocytosis. While calcium uptake is largely regulated by photosynthesis (59), processes controlled by Ca 2 \u03e9 ion signaling in coral physiology is under reported and worthy of attention. Our coral host protein data set shows high expression of tSNARE and synaptogamin but low expression of vSNARE and calmodulin. This is consistent with the host having the capacity to execute rapid symbiont exocytosis. As expected, there was no evidence of tSNARE or synaptogamin proteins expressed by algal endosymbionts nor, surprisingly, were vSNARE proteins found. We have suggested previously that endosymbiont-directed exocytosis could be a mechanism for \"symbiont shuffling\" of Symbiodinium clades (16) . Not detecting vSNARE proteins might suggest that endosymbionts can only manipulate membrane fusion through expression of their own vSNARE proteins early in the bleaching process. We therefore posit that vSNARE protein expression triggers the onset of bleaching but is not expressed during late-stage bleaching by residual stress-resistant Symbiodinium that remain in hospite, and calmodulin is released to bind free calcium required by host-encoded synaptogamin to unclamp the SNARE complex assembly necessary for membrane fusion and, thus, terminate complete symbiont exocytosis. Proteomic experiments are now warranted whereby the process and timing of exocytosis can be more fully explored.",

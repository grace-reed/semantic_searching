As a consequence of HRF activity, some of the potential energy supply for the algae is lost through transfer to the host in the form of photosynthate, thus reducing the potential for algal growth. PIF may provide another means of regulation of the intracellular algal population. Such regulation may be important as symbiotic algae may grow faster than their host and there may be some ''cost'' to the host in maintaining them. Some corals appear to regulate the growth of their intracellular algae by releasing a small proportion ( V 0.1% per day) of their algae periodically (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 1987) . However, by slowing their growth rate by the use of a cell signal such as PIF, a coral could avoid the need to expel excess algae.",

However, as An. elegantissima is one of the few hosts that occurs naturally in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic forms, it may not be representative of all symbiotic cnidarians. P. versipora is an encrusting scleractinian coral that is widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific region (Veron, 2000) in both temperate and tropical regions. In Port Jackson, Australia, it tends to grow on the sides of boulders or under overhanging rocks in shallow water (1 -4 m) and, in deeper water (5 -9 m), it also grows on the upper surfaces of rocks. When we discovered a small aposymbiotic specimen in the field more than 10 years ago, we routinely tested the homogenized tissue for HRF activity. We found that when algae freshly isolated from symbiotic P. versipora were incubated in homogenized tissue from this aposymbiotic coral, release of photosynthate was stimulated (nine times higher than controls) and carbon fixation was also inhibited by 52% (R.J. Ritchie, K. Eltringham and R. Hinde, unpublished results). These results indicated that HRF and PIF were present in this naturally occurring aposymbiotic coral. These preliminary findings suggested that the presence of symbiotic algae was not essential for the production of these two cell signals. However, aposymbiotic specimens of P. versipora are rare in Port Jackson and probably only occur as a result of extreme stress. In a five year population study of P. versipora (1993 -1998) , which included more than 500 marked colonies in three separate locations within Port Jackson, only one aposymbiotic colony was observed (K.J.T. Withers, personal communication). To confirm our earlier findings, we tested this naturally occurring aposymbiotic coral for HRF and PIF, as well as several artificially produced aposymbiotic colonies of P. versipora prepared in the laboratory.",

The fact that both signals continue to be expressed in corals that lacked photosynthesizing algae suggests that it is an advantage to the coral to have these signals already active when algae start to repopulate the host after a period of low algal numbers. Such periods of low populations could occur after any stress which caused the corals to lose most of their algae. This is the first time, after many attempts over more than 10 years, that we have succeeded in producing aposymbiotic P. versipora.

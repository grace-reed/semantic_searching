PCP is water-soluble and has the blue-green (470 nm to 550 nm) absorbing carotenoid peridinin as its primary pigments. Symbiodinium, the most commonly found endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in symbiosis with corals [4, 5] , also contain PCPs as their major light harvesting complexes [6] [7] [8] . A recent study [9] suggested that Symbiodinium PCP may play an important role in coral bleaching, which results from the loss of Symbiodinium cells from the coral host or the loss of photosynthetic pigments from Symbiodinium [4] . Because coral bleaching always follows severe photoinhibition [9] [10] [11] , and moderate heat stress can induce the algal photosystem II (PSII) photoinhibition by damaging photosynthetic light harvesting complexes and thylakoid membranes [9, 12] , it is hypothesized that increased sea surface temperature is one of the major factors that trigger coral bleaching. The study [9] showed that the level of PCP in a cultured thermal-sensitive Symbiodinium strain dropped under light conditions when temperature increased, supporting the temperature-induced coral bleaching theory and suggesting the connection between Symbiodinium PCP and coral bleaching.",

                "text": "However, Symbiodinium PCP is poorly understood in the aspects of structure, spectroscopic properties, energy transfer, etc. In general, dinoflagellate PCP proteins are very diverse. The length, pigment content, sequence and spectroscopic properties of PCP can be distinct among different dinoflagellates or even in an individual dinoflagellate. In the aspect of length, there are two forms of PCPs: one is a homodimer with a monomeric molecular mass of~15 kDa [13, 14] , the other is a monomer with a molecular mass of 32-35 kDa [3, 13, 14] . The latter form was hypothesized to be the product of duplication and subsequent fusion of the PCP gene encoding the former form [8, 15] . Two monomers of the homodimeric PCP probably form a dimer, whose structure could be very similar to that of the monomeric PCP monomer [3, 16] . In Amphidinium carterae, three copies of the monomeric PCP associate to form a trimeric complex [3, 17] . The species specificity of the PCP quaternary structure has been reported [14] . Both monomeric and homodimeric forms were detected in Symbiodinium microadriaticum, while Symbiodinium kawagutii and Symbiodinium pilosum only possess a single form of PCP, monomeric and homodimeric forms, respectively [14] . In the aspect of pigment content of PCP, the molar ratio of peridinin and Chl a varies: the main form PCP complex (MFPCP) from A. carterae has the pigment composition of 8:2 [3] ; the high-salt PCP (HSPCP) from the same species, eluted at higher salt concentration from an ion exchange column, has 6 peridinins and 2 Chl a molecules in one monomer [18] ; Haxo et al. reported a 9:2 ratio for the PCP from Amphidinium carterae Plymouth 450 [1] ; PCP from Alexandrium cohorticula may consist of 12 peridinins and 2 Chl a molecules [19] .",

                "text": "In order to understand the source and significance of PCP isoforms, PCP protein structures and PCP genes have been explored since 1990s. Among different PCPs, the structures of MFPCP and HSPCP from A. carterae have been resolved to 2.0 \u00c5 and 2.1 \u00c5, respectively [3, 18] . A higher resolution of 1.5 \u00c5 was recently resolved in refolded PCP [21] . The X-ray crystal structure of MFPCP has revealed a trimer, in which each subunit folds in a twofold pseudosymmetry (a monomer has two pseudo-identical domains), holding 8 peridinins and 2 Chl a molecules. On the other hand, HSPCP crystallized as a monomer, which contains 6 peridinins and 2 Chl a molecules. The high degree of structural similarity was observed, although sequence variations led to the differences in the level of the protein scaffold, pigment composition, and interaction between the pigments and their binding environment [18] . The sequence analysis of PCP genes and transcripts based on the data from A. carterae [22] , G. polyedra [15] , Heterocapsa pygmaea [16, 23] and Symbiodinium sp. [8, 13, 24] revealed that PCP genes are nuclearencoded, intronless and exist in tandem arrays. PCP gene arrays consist of coding regions and the spacers in between. The lengths of coding regions and spacers, as well as the copy number of PCP genes, are species-specific. The sequences of coding regions in PCP gene arrays are distinct among different dinoflagellate species and even in one individual dinoflagellate. Along with the observation of multiple PCP isoforms with varying pIs, the PCP gene heterogeneity is believed to be the source of the isoforms. However, except for two different forms of PCP proteins (MFPCP and HSPCP from A. carterae), which have been detected and determined at the protein sequence and structure level [3, 16, 18] , there has been no report successfully relating cDNA or gDNA sequences to their corresponding protein sequences because of the complexity of PCP genes and the possible protein expression preferences.",

                "text": "In the LC-MS/MS peptide sequencing experiment, peptides from PCP protein were fragmented in the mass spectrometer by collisioninduced dissociation. The protonated peptides fragment along the peptide backbone to form b and y production ions. The peptide sequences were elucidated from the match between in-silico digested protein sequence and sequence product ions from experiment [35] . All detected peptides were processed by MassMatrix Database Search Engine [36, 37] . The comparison of the translated PCP sequences with peptide sequencing by LC-MS/MS, revealed that the mature protein starts at Asp53. Protein sequence alignment of five PCP proteins (which exist at the protein level, UniProt entries: P51873 [22] , P51874 [8] , P51889 [19] , P80483 [22] and P80484 [3] ) and translated sequences in this study shows that all mature PCPs begin at Asp53, and except for the HSPCP of A. carterae, other proteins share a sequence of DEIGDAAK at the N terminus. The search results also show that the sequence of the trypsin digested sample exactly matches the deduced sequence of clone 7 (Fig. 3) . The calculated MW of the putative PCP mature protein deduced from clone L4 is 32.8 kDa, which is in agreement with the MW of 32.7 kDa obtained by LC/MS. Compared to other protein sequencing methods, e.g. Edman degradation [8, 13] and protein microsequencing [15] , the LC-MS/MS protein sequencing obtained a full coverage, which is the highest to our knowledge for any PCP. We explored more characteristics of PCP based on DNA and protein sequence. As expected, the first half of the mature PCP apoprotein (Asp53-Ala208) has 61% identity with the second half (Pro209-Gln364). An identity of 54% was observed in previous studies [8, 15] . Along with the two-fold symmetry of PCP X-ray crystal structure [3, 18] , our finding supports the hypothesis that the monomeric form of PCPs arose by duplication and fusion of gene(s) encoding the homodimeric form [8, 15] . The transit sequence (underlined sequence in green in Fig. 3 ) adjacent to the mature PCP sequence has two distinct hydrophobic regions when analyzed by ExPASy ProtScale. This transit peptide (TP) shares an identity of 43% with the G. polyedra PCP transit peptide [15, 38] , which contains an additional hydroxylated amino acids (S/T)-rich region flanked with two distinct hydrophobic regions. The first region could guide the nuclear-encoded protein translocation from cytosol to chloroplast, and then be cleaved off, generating an intermediate preprotein; the second region could lead the intermediate to thylakoids where a thylakoidal processing peptidase (TPP) recognizes the A-X-A motif in TP, cleaves TP off and generates the mature apoprotein [39] [40] [41] . The second hydrophobic regions of both G. polyedra and Symbiodinium sp. TPs are rich in alanine, a typical feature of several TPs of nuclearencoded thylakoid proteins [40] . The TP sequence analysis is in agreement with the co-crystallization of PCP and DGDG [3] , which is mostly found in the inner thylakoid membrane [42] , supporting that PCP is located in the thylakoid lumen [8, 15] .",

                "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first report that relates PCP gene sequence to its corresponding protein sequence in the genus Symbiodinium. Previous attempts only included cDNA sequence [16, 23] , or a partial PCP protein sequence [19] , or a very small portion of PCP protein sequence that corresponds to cDNA [8, 13, 15] , except for the MFPCP and HSPCP from A. carterae, whose crystal structures have been determined [3, 18, 22] . Only three groups have reported the descriptions of the PCP gene organization in Symbiodinium [8, 13, 24] , but none of them was able to determine the PCP sequence at both gene and protein level. The sequencing and molecular experiments show that the major form of PCP in Symbiodinium sp. CS-156 is monomeric, and intronless PCP genes are organized in tandem arrays. The arrangement of PCP genes in this organism is very similar to that of other dinoflagellates, although the DNA and protein sequences are different from those of others. The occurrence of heterogeneity in the PCP gene tandem repeats is also observed. The PCP gene heterogeneity was believed to be inconsistent with concerted evolution [24] , which leads to the sequences of related genes to co-evolve over some period of time. However, although the variations can be detected at both mRNA [22, 24] and protein level [1, 2, 6, 13, 14] , the number of major isoforms in an individual organism seems to be very limited: an isoform with a single pI or isoforms with subtle pI differences always overwhelm other PCP species. This situation could also be applied to Symbiodinium sp. CS-156: we have found that there are some other isoforms expressed, but that the one characterized in this study is the main one (data not shown). It is noted that the hypothesis of the existence of major isoform(s) does not conflict with the fact that both monomeric and homodimeric forms were detected in S. microadriaticum [14] , in which major isoforms have pIs of 7.2, 7.3, 7.6 and 7.7. Since each fraction with the same pI was able to separate into two PCP species with distinct sizes but the same spectroscopic properties, the monomeric form could have arisen by duplication and fusion of gene(s) encoding the homodimeric form: the two PCPs of different lengths but the same pI could be the products of the same gene. In sum, there could be some posttranscriptional mechanism Protein MW = 32.7 kDa Fig. 2 . The identification of PCP by SDS-PAGE (A) and LC/MS (B). SDS-PAGE revealed a single band at a mass of about 33 kDa, which was determined to be 32.7 kDa by LC/MS. Fig. 3 . PCP protein sequence identification. The listed sequence is the predicted amino acid sequence of a PCP gene clone (Clone 7, JQ395030). LC/MSMS experiment by UPLC-QTOF (Waters, Synapt G2) identified multiple peptides, assembly of all of which matches the predicted sequence of clone 7. The transit peptide is in green; the solidunderlined sequence in green is the possible thylakoid-targeting domain; the two boxes indicate the possible Chl a molecules binding sites; the dotted-underlined sequences are the possible peridinin binding sites. that leads to the mature apoPCP expression preference. At this point, the PCP expression pattern appears to be consistent with the concerted evolution model.",

The spectrum consists of a broad band between 400 and 550 nm, two shoulders at 420 nm and 520 nm, and three peaks at nm, 476 nm and 670 nm. The peridinin S -S 2 transition results in the dominant broad band between 400 and 550 nm with the peridinin absorption maximum at 476 nm. The Chl a Soret band, which overlaps with the broad peridinin band, is at 438 nm. The Chl a Q y band peaks at 670 nm, while the weak Q x band is overlapped by the peridinin S 0 -S 2 transition band. The absorption spectrum taken at 77 K (Fig. 5 ) has a similar shape, except that the Chl a Soret band is split into two peaks with maxima at 433 nm and 438 nm, indicating the different protein environments of two Chl a molecules. To locate the possible Chl a binding sites in the Symbiodinium PCP, the Symbiodinium PCP putative protein sequence (as listed in Fig. 3) was aligned with the A. carterae PCP (PDB ID: 1PPR), in which His66 interacts with Chl a through a water molecule in the first half of the mature protein [43] , and Leu254 along with His229 are part of the environment of the COOH-terminal chlorophyll [3] in the second half of the mature protein. The two boxes in Fig. 3 are very likely to bind Chl a molecules in Symbiodinium PCP because these two fragments have the same amino acid sequences with the PCP (PDB ID: 1PPR) Chl a binding regions (the region around His66 and the region around Leu254 and His229). Region 1 (AAEAHHKAIGSISGPNGVTSRADWD) and region 2 (LKAAAEAHHKAIGSIDA) share a sequence of AAEAHHKAIGSI, but have the rest of the amino acid residues with distinct properties, resulting in different protein environments that can be detected in 77 K absorption spectrum.",

The protein sequence analysis revealed the conservative binding sites for peridinin and Chl a molecules in Symbiodinium PCP (Fig. 3 , two boxes and two dotted-underlined sequences are the possible binding pockets for Chl a and peridinin molecules, respectively) [3, 43, 45] .

The spectra of the PCP methanol extract and Chl a in methanol were normalized at the Chl a Q y band. The contribution of Chl a absorbance at 469 nm was deducted from the PCP methanol extract absorbance at the same wavelength (Fig. 8) . The calculated value of the molar ratio is 4.07, which is very close to 4. This result along with the spectroscopic properties indicates that Symbiodinium PCP is very likely to share the same structure of A. carterae MFPCP, although the sequence identity is~83% based on the alignment of the Symbiodinium PCP sequence (listed in Fig. 3 ) with the A. carterae PCP (PDB ID: 1PPR).

Despite the occurrence of the PCP gene heterogeneity, a single form of PCP was identified and sequenced, indicating the possible existence of a PCP major form. The resulting sequence matches the deduced sequence of PCP gene clone 7. The detection of PCP protein and its corresponding gene is first reported in the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium and may provide an important hint for future evolutionary studies. The protein sequence analysis, along with the spectroscopic studies, revealed the conservative pigment binding sites, which may be one of the key factors that determine the consistently high peridinin-to-Chl a energy transfer efficiency in dinoflagellate PCPs.",

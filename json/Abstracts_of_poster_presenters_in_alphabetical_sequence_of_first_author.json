One hundred and nineteen healthy adolescents aged 14-17 years were studied: 65 Caucasians (Russians, mean age 15.02 AE 0.98 years) and 54 Mongoloids (Buryats, mean age 15.31 AE 0.96 years). All adolescents lived on the Asian territory of Russia. Peripheral blood was obtained for DNA isolation. The C60T mutation gene SOD was genotyped. We found in group of Caucasian adolescents the frequencies of CC, CT and TT genotypes: 87.7%, 7.7%, 4.6% respectively. The frequency of the mutant T-allele was 8.5%. In the Buryat adolescents we identified only the CC -genotype carriers (100%). The frequency of the mutant T-allele was 0%.

This redox metabolite can diffuse across cells and tissues and initiate cellular responses, thus acting as an important transcription-independent signaling molecule. As a signaling molecule its concentration increases only slightly from steady-state levels (10-100 nM), yet much higher levels can be measured during pathological stress. Real time extracellular monitoring of resting and rapid changes of H O 2 in the nanomolar range in complex biological media is demanding and requires the design of (bio) sensors with high sensitivity, selectivity, low limit of detection and rapid response time. Detection of H 2 O 2 based on electrochemical sensors is attractive because these can be used in diverse biological preparations, ranging from cell cultures to ex vivo (slices, biopsies and biological fluids) and in vivo applications (implantable sensors). Here we have designed, characterized and evaluated novel sensing strategies using microelectrodes, and screenprinting electrodes for detection and monitoring of H 2 O 2 in diverse biological preparations. We have explored surface modification strategies such as electrodeposition of platinum nanoparticles and hexacyanoferrate mediators to attain high selectivity and sensitivity measurements of H 2 O 2 .

Currently, the knowledge about the effects of microgravity on human skin, the first and most important barrier involved in homeostasis and defense of the organism, has been little investigated. So, we decided to study the effects of microgravity on human keratinocytes. They were placed on a Random Positioning Machine (RPM), inside a humidified incubator (5% CO 2 at 37 C) for increasing times. Treated keratinocytes were distinguished by a set of core features associated with senescence cell damage that become more evident depending on the duration of the test. In particular, microgravity affects cells proliferation and morphology and induces the secretion of cytokines, (i.e. IL1\u03b1, IL 6 and IL8), that are a part of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) . Moreover, electrophysiological approach shows the ability of microgravity to decrease total membrane current. In conclusion, our work suggests an effect of microgravity on keratinocytes that deserves to be investigated. Nitric oxide is a key-player in cellular redox signaling. Its addition onto cysteines thiols, the S-nitrosylation (SNO), is involved in many biochemical and physiological processes [1] . The regulation mechanisms induced by this post-translational modification and their implications in cancer are intense matter of research. Thousands of proteins undergo Snitrosylation, and its dysregulation is implicated in many diseases including cancer [2] . The elucidation of molecular mechanisms underpinning regulation by SNO is essential to open avenues for cancer therapies. Albeit molecular modeling is known to be a powerful tool in such context, redox regulation by SNO has been widely underappreciated by the computational community. We seek to unveil the molecular mechanisms linked to protein regulation by S-nitrosylation. Using computational chemistry methods, we investigated the structure of a cancer-related kinase, c-Src, known to be activated upon SNO [3] . Long-range communication paths between amino acids play here a major role. The target cysteine being conserved, this regulation mechanism might be conserved throughout the Src family kinases.

Multiple studies have characterized OxPLs as inducers of proinflammatory, procoagulant and proangiogenic mediators in a variety of cells and tissues. Accumulating evidence suggests that OxPLs induce these proteins through signaling pathways that are different from those utilized by the majority of physiological inducers of inflammation, blood clotting and angiogenesis. Selective inhibition of these OxPLs-specific signaling pathways potentially can prevent development of pathology without impairing normal physiological processes.This presentation will discuss specific intracellular signaling mechanisms mediating induction of interleukin-8, tissue factor and VEGF by OxPLs. As a proof of principle for selective inhibition of OxPL-induced inflammation a new chemical scaffold will be described that selectively inhibits production of interleukin-8 by OxPLs but has minimal effects on the action of innate immune mediators and agonists such as cytokines (TNFa, IL-1\u03b2) or bacterial products (lipopolysaccharide).

As a result of elevated ROS production, cancer cells rely heavily on antioxidant systems to keep redox homeostasis. The thioredoxin and glutaredoxin/glutathione systems regulate oxidative stress being determinant for cell survival and proliferation. Mercury compounds have been shown to target quite effectively the thioredoxin system. Thus, the aim of this study is to test the effects of two mercury compounds, thimerosal (TM) and ethylmercury (EtHg) in human glioblastoma cells in comparison to temozolamide (TMZ) frequently used in chemotherapy. Cell viability of U87 cells was measured in the presence of EtHg and TM by MTT assay and after 24h the GI50 was approximately 13 \u03bcM. Following exposure of cells to EtHg and TM (5, 10 e 15 \u03bcm) TrxR and Trx activity decreased very significantly in cytosol and mitochondria. GSH levels were evaluated by the DTNB assay and GPx by the NADPH-consumption assay. Expression of TrxR, Trx and GPx was evaluated in whole-cell lysates by Western Blot. Overall, results indicate that Hg compounds alone and combined with TMZ constitute a promising therapeutic tool to tackle antioxidant defenses and overcame tumors therapy resistance.

These reactions caused damage to lipids, nucleosides, amino acids and their derivatives.

We hypothesised that the myeloperoxidase (MPO)-generated inflammatory oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) would affect native human coronary artery smooth muscle cell (HCASMC)-derived ECM, and contribute to ECM damage and vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. Methods: ECM laid down by HCASMCs was decellularized and exposed to a MPO system (0-200 \u03bcM H 2 O 2 /200 mM Cl -/20 nM MPO). Localization of MPO and ECM proteins was detected by confocal microscopy. ECM damage was investigated using antibodies against specific ECM proteins via ELISA, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Results: MPO is shown to bind preferentially to the matrix glycoprotein fibronectin, and initiates HOCl generation and ECM damage in a dosedependent manner. ECM modifications were detected with 10 \u03bcM or greater H 2 O 2 . MPO is shown to have a higher affinity for oxidized ECM than the parent material. Conclusions: These experiments show that MPO binds avidly to the ECM and generates damage via formation of HOCl using pathophysiological concentrations of H 2 O 2 . This damage promotes further MPO binding and rationalizes the accumulation of oxidative modifications on the ECM with age and disease. This damage is proposed to contribute to the formation of vulnerable plaques in atherosclerosis.",

The biocompatibility of nanoparticles was evaluated based on cell viability, cell morphology and expression of an apoptotic marker, and by evaluation of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an inner ear cell line (OC-k3) derived from the Immortomouse\u00ae Organ of Corti. The results showed that nanoparticles based on barium titanate slightly reduced cell viability at high doses (50 \u03bcM, 500 \u03bcM, 1000 \u03bcM) up to 48h while those based on lithium niobate induced a significant increase at 72h from treatment.

However, disulfides, which comprise of two covalently linked Cys residues are also a target for oxidants, with their reactivity varying greatly depending on the disulfide environment. Exposure of disulfide containing proteins to oxidants results in the incorporation of oxygen, consistent with the formation of thiosulfinates or related species. Subsequent addition of GSH decreases oxygen content and results in the adduction of GSH to the protein as assessed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. Increasing incubation time post-oxidant exposure results in a decrease in glutathionylation, consistent with the formation of a reactive intermediate species on the protein by the oxidant. This appears to be a general oxidation reaction for disulfides as a wide range of oxidants are capable of inducing GSHylation of disulfide-containing proteins including hypochlorous acid, peroxynitrous acid, singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The oxidation of disulfide bonds therefore represents a novel mechanism for the glutathionylation of proteins, which may play an important role in cell signalling.",

Trentini The skin is the main organs exposed to airborne particulate matter (PM) . In this work, we analyzed the proinflammatory and oxidative effects of PM components on inflammatory responses. We investigated four redoxactive chemicals, such Cu (II) metal and quinones generated by atmospheric oxidation or cellular metabolic processes from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); 9,10 phenanthrenequinone and naphthoquinone 1,2-NQN and 1,4-NQN. We performed in vitro tests on human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells and also acellular assays based on the oxidation of dithiothreitol and ascorbic acid antioxidants to assess the oxidative potential (OP). We found that the treated keratinocytes showed increased activation of NF\u03baB and increased levels of IL8 gene expression. Moreover, the treatment with Cu (II) and quinones increased the activities and expression of specific redox response genes, SOD1 and GPX. Finally, we found an induced alteration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure and apoptosis after 24 h. Our results suggest that the pollutant components are able to modulate signal transduction pathways, the activation of inflammatory and oxidative damage in the skin. Altogether these observations indicate that exposure of skin to air pollutants modifies the redox equilibrium of keratinocytes, which could explain the increased skin damage observed in populations that live in high-pollution cities.",

Biochemical mechanisms of the anti-obesity effect of an ursolic acid-enriched extract of Cynomorium songaricum in high fat diet-induced obese mice HCY2, an ursolic acid-enriched extract of Cynomorii Herba, has been shown to significantly reduce body weight gain and the weight of white fat pads in various adipose tissues as well as attenuate indices of the associated metabolic syndrome, namely, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia and fatty liver in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The current study demonstrated that the weight reduction produced by HCY2 is associated with activation of the AMPK signalling pathway with resultant increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial uncoupling in skeletal muscle in vivo. A recoupler, ketocholestanol, was used to explore the possible role of mitochondrial uncoupling in the antiobesity effect afforded by HCY2 in HFD-fed mice. Taken together, our results suggest that HCY2 may be proved to be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders. The denitrosylase S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) has been suggested to sustain mitochondrial removal by autophagy (mitophagy), functionally linking S-nitrosylation to cell senescence and aging. In this study, we provide evidence that GSNOR is induced at the translational level in response to hydrogen peroxide and mitochondrial ROS. The use of selective pharmacological inhibitors and siRNAs demonstrate that GSNOR induction is an event downstream of the redox-mediated activation of ATM, which in turn phosphorylates CHK2 and p53 as intermediate players of this signaling axis. Changes in the levels of GSNOR, or the expression of a redox-insensitive form of ATM modulates cell sensitivity to oxidative stress, impacts mitophagy, and affects cell survival. Overall, our data place GSNOR as a crucial molecular player underlying the emerging antioxidant function of ATM.",

Considering that monosodium L-glutamate (MSG)-induced obese mice have been appointed as a useful model for NAFLD studies, our study aimed to investigate whether myricetin could ameliorate NAFLD in MSG mice. To test our hypothesis, newborn male Swiss mice were injected with MSG solution s.c. (4mg/kg/ day) on alternate days in the first 10 days of life (n\u00bc16), control animals (n\u00bc8) received 0.9% saline solution. Assessment of metabolic syndrome features was made every 30 days of life. After reaching 90 days of life, MSG mice were treated with either myricetin (50mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 6 weeks. At the end of treatment, mice were euthanized, blood samples were collected for biochemistry assessment and liver samples were collected for histopathologic analysis. Myricetin treatment did not change body mass and visceral and non-visceral adipose tissue depots. However, it attenuated hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin sensitivity, as compared to MSG untreated mice. Finally, myricetin treatment totally reverted the microvesicular stetosis observed in MSG mice. In conclusion, our data allow us to suggest that liver is a main target of myricetin, which would be a potential adjuvant for NAFLD treatment.",

Assembly of NLRP3/ASC inflammasome triggers pro-caspase-1 activation, thus, resulting in IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 maturation. However, an aberrant activation of inflammasome system has been implicated in several human diseases.Our aim was to investigate the possible role of inflammasome in the chronic subclinical inflammatory condition typical of RTT, by analysing this complex in basal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u00fe ATP-stimulated primary fibroblasts, as well as in serum from RTT patients and healthy volunteers.RTT cells showed increased levels of nuclear NF-\u03baB and cytosolic ASC proteins, pro-IL-1\u03b2 mRNA, and NLRP3/ ASC interaction in basal condition, without any further response upon the LPS\u00feATP stimuli. Moreover, augmented levels of circulating ASC and caspase-1 proteins were found in serum of RTT patients, which are likely able to amplify the inflammatory response. Taken together, our findings indicate that RTT patients exhibited a challenged inflammasome machinery at cellular and systemic level, which may feed and perpetuate the subclinical inflammatory state observed in the pathology.",

High fat diet-induced obesity alters mitochondrial dynamics in mouse white adipose tissue: effects of anthocyanins A dynamic process of fusion and fission sustains mitochondria functionality. Excess nutrient availability can cause alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and function. This study investigated the potential alterations in mitochondrial dynamics occurring in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) as a consequence of high fat diet (HF)-induced obesity in mice. The protective effects of anthocyanins (AC) supplementation was also characterized. C57BL/6J male mice were fed for 14 w control (C) or HF diets, with or without 40 mg AC/kg body weight (HFA). Transmission electron microscopy showed altered sWAT mitochondria morphology, with a large number of elongated mitochondria, in HF compared to C and HFA mice. Drp1, a cytosolic dynamin GTPase, is phosphorylated, recruited to the mitochondria, and bound to receptors (e.g. Mff, Fis1) to initiate fission. This can target damaged mitochondria for mitophagy, which involves Parkin and NIX. Total Drp1, Fis1, Mff, Parkin and NIX content; and Drp1 phosphorylation (Ser 616) levels were markedly lower in HF sWAT compared to controls. AC prevented the decrease in Drp1, Drp1 phosphorylation, Parkin and NIX levels. Results suggest that HF-induced obesity impairs mitochondria fission and their disposal by mitophagy, which can be in part mitigated by AC intake.",

We used healthy donors (n\u00bc35) and patients with AAP without nephropathy (n\u00bc42) as comparison groups. The presence of nephropathy was confirmed by an increase in serum NGAL. Patients' BAC averaged 2.2\u2030. The age of all individuals ranged from 20-40 years. The GAGE questionnaire was used to confirm AAP and exclude chronic intoxication. We found a significant increase in AOPP level in both with nephropathy and without it (p<0.05) relative to the healthy donors. AOPP level in the group with nephropathy was much higher than in the group without nephropathy (p\u00bc0.006). ANOVA test did not confirm the effect of alcohol poisoning severity on AOPP level. eGFR values influenced the AOPP level. Alcohol poisoning severity was a factor affecting the CD level (F\u00bc12.93, p\u00bc0.0006), while the presence of nephropathy had no effect. So CD level was significantly decreased in moderate severity. There was a negative correlation between AOPP and CD (r\u00bc-0.32), as well as a positive correlation between CD and BAC (r\u00bc0.31). Thus, AOPP can be considered as a predictor of the nephropathy presence. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease that ranges from benign steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Disturbed hepatic lipid homeostasis, oxygenated cholesterol products (oxysterols) and apoptotic activity is shown to lead the NAFLD development.",

Barbosa 1,2 , Ana Ledo 1,2 , Jo\u00e3o Laranjinha The reduction of nitrite has recently emerged as an alternative pathway for nitric oxide ( NO) production in vivo. This source of NO may be particularly relevant under conditions of insufficient oxygen supply, which reduces enzymatic production of NO. In fact, nitrite has been shown to be protective in ischemia/reperfusion and appears to be beneficial in aging and neurodegeneration. Importantly, nitrite concentration in vivo can be modulated through the ingestion of nitrate-rich foods. One putative target for the protective activity of nitrite in ischemia is through the modulation of mitochondrial respiration. Here we used highresolution respirometry to determine the effects of nitrite on brain tissue respiration using an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion. Thus far we have observed that the oxidative burst observed upon reoxygenation can be abolished by nitrite (10 \u03bcM). This inhibition may prevent the increased production of reactive oxygen species associated with the oxidative burst and may explain nitrite's protection during brain ischemia. Future work will focus on confirming whether this effect requires nitrite reduction to NO, as well as determining the site of action of nitrite/ NO within the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

A chronic state of systemic inflammation is reported in both diseases and associates with poor vascular outcomes. Defining the mechanistic pathways that lead to these poor outcomes may allow stratification of patients for intervention and lead to identification of new therapeutic targets. We hypothesised that oxidation products within the circulation may contribute to poor outcomes and serve as markers of disease comorbidity. We analysed plasma samples from a cohort of 500 CKD patients who fulfilled NICE CKD guidelines for secondary care follow-up for CKD and enrolled in the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care (RIISC) study. Periodontal health was assessed as bleeding on probing and clinical attachment loss. Plasma samples were analysed for protein carbonyls and F2-\u03b1-isoprostanes using ELISA methods. Multiple regression analysis showed that plasma protein carbonyls were significantly negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; P<0.001), and with periodontal disease; clinical attachment loss (P\u00bc0.046). Plasma F2-\u03b1-isoprostanes were significantly and negatively correlated with eGFR (P\u00bc0.031) and bleeding on probing (P\u00bc0.074).

Characterization of amyloid precursor protein processing and oxidative stress in iPSC-derived neuron and astrocyte co-cultures carrying a PSEN1 mutation (Hill et al., 2016) . Using this approach, we cultured cortical networks that carry a mutation in the presenillin-1 (PSEN1) gene and compared markers associated with altered amyloid precursor protein processing and oxidative stress. Materials and methods: Human iPSCderived neural precursors cells (ax0018, ax0112, Axol Biosciences) were cultured for 40 days into neuron and astrocyte co-cultures. Immunocytochemical staining was used to identify cellular localisation of TUJ-1, S100b, ADAM10 and APP. ADAM10 and APPr expression was measured via western blotting. Protein carbonyls, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and antioxidant capacity were also assessed as markers of oxidative stress. Results: ADAM10 expression and APPr was significantly reduced in iPSC co-cultures carrying the PSEN1 mutation (p<0.05) compared to control. Protein carbonyls, lipid peroxidation, F2isoprostanes and DNA oxidation was significantly elevated in PSEN1 cells (p<0.05). Conclusions: iPSC derived cortical networks carrying a PSEN1 mutation have a decreased ratio of APP isoforms (130kDa:110kDa) and increased markers of oxidative stress compared healthy control cells. Telomeres are ribonucleoprotein complexes that cap and protect chromosome ends. Human telomeric DNA naturally shortens during somatic cell division and also as a result of oxidative damage. Telomere erosion eventually compromises telomere integrity, triggering a DNA damage response which results in the onset of cellular senescence. The loss of telomere integrity and the accumulation of senescent cells with ageing have been increasingly implicated in the loss of tissue homeostasis and the development of age-related pathologies. Hence understanding the factors and mechanisms that control these processes may be relevant to develop strategies for heathier ageing. In this presentation I will review evidence linking telomere length with environmental, psychosocial and life-style factors. I will also discuss the association between accelerated telomere shortening, psychological stress, stress responsiveness and the possible role of oxidative stress as a mediating mechanism. Finally, I will examine potential non-pharmacological interventions that might counteract telomere damage, thus promoting genomic stability and cell longevity.",

Peroxyl radicals induce oxidative crosslinking of superoxide dismutase 1 through self-reaction of protein radicals Introduction: Oxidation of proteins can generate protein crosslinks through self-reaction of protein-derived radicals, with the yields dependent on the steady state concentration of the initial oxidant. Hypothesis: Peroxyl radicals (ROO ) produced by thermolysis of AAPH (2,2 0 -azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)dihydrochloride) would mediate oxidation of Trp and Tyr residues in human and bovine superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), respectively, leading to Trp-Trp and Tyr-Tyr crosslinks. Experimental: SOD1 (3 mg/mL) were incubated with AAPH (10-100 mM) in phosphate buffer (37 C). Samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE, amino acid analysis, carbonyl quantification, and enzymatic activity (cytochrome c assay). Cross-links were detected in hydrolysed proteins by mass spectrometry. Results: AAPH-mediated oxidation (3 h) generated protein dimers. With 100 mM AAPH, this was accompanied by consumption of parent Trp for human-SOD1, and limited losses of parent Tyr in bovine-SOD1. Trp-Trp (m/z \u00bc 407) and Tyr-Tyr (m/z \u00bc 361) crosslinks were detected in oxidized and hydrolysed human-SOD1 and bovine-SOD1 samples respectively. Carbonyl yields increased in a linear manner over time, implying limited production of carbonyl-dependent, Schiffbase-derived crosslinks. Conclusions: Low rates of ROO production induce SOD1 crosslinking via Tyr-Tyr and Trp-Trp bonds.",

Namely the vehicle has been specifically formulated to apply on the skin both hyaluronic acid and the antioxidant retinyl palmitate. The latter has been loaded in lipid nanoparticles suitable to solubilize this lipophilic molecule. Particularly retinyl palmitate has been encapsulated both in solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers, respectively constituted of pure tristearin or a mixture of tristearin and caprylic/ capric triglyceride. Nanoparticles were characterized by discoidal and flat shape, lamellar inner structure, as evidenced by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and x-ray, while their mean diameter was 132 nm, as measured by photon correlation spectroscopy. The presence of the liquid caprylic/capric triglyceride within nanostructured lipid carriers allowed to encapsulate retinyl palmitate more efficiently with respect to solid lipid nanoparticles. In order to obtain a gel to be applied on the wounds, hyaluronic acid has been directly added into the aqueous dispersion of nanostructured lipid carriers containing retinyl palmitate. The nanoparticulate gel \"wound healing\" effect has been evaluated in scratch wound assay in keratinocytes. The wounded areas of treated and control cells displayed significant differences during the first 24 h postwounding, indicating a synergic effect of retinyl palmitate and hyaluronic acid. Although neutrophil granulocytes are usually regarded as archetypical pro-inflammatory cells, they also can exert anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory functions. In previous studies, we showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent formation of aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps (aggNETs) is crucial for resolution of inflammation of experimental arthritis and lupus. The underlying mechanism involves neutrophil serine proteases that degrade locally released cytokines and chemokines and thereby interrupt ongoing inflammatory processes. In this project we aimed to employ restoration and amplification of NET formation for inducing resolution of innate-and autoimmune-driven inflammation. To this end we made use of NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2-activating sulfonamides and aminoferrocene-based NOX2-independent ROS amplifiers. Preliminary data suggest that the NOX2-activator RE-02 induces (agg)NET formation and alleviates experimental lupus and that the aminoferrocene-based prodrug MIS43 triggeres (agg)NET formation and prevents chronification of gouty arthritis in mice with non-functional NOX2. Treatment with MIS43 was associated with lower local levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Taken together, the studies suggest a therapeutic efficiency of ROS-induction in chronic inflammatory syndromes that occur in the context of defective NOX2. The mechanism of OH-induced oxidation of \u03b3-Glu-(Pro) n -Met peptides (n \u00bc 0 -3) was investigated in aqueous solutions using pulse radiolysis techniques. Using such peptides allowed for distance control between the side-chain sulfur of Met and the amino group of Glu. Interactions between them were probed by monitoring formation of C-centered, Rutin has been shown to be beneficial to aquatic organisms, since it improves their immune, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses. However, it is unknown how rutin acts in response to a challenging situation as Aeromonas hydrophila infection in silver catfish. The aims of this research were to assess the influence of the dietary supplementation with rutin on inflammation and antioxidant responses in muscle of silver catfish challenged with A. hydrophila. Fish were split into four groups as follows (in triplicate, n \u00bc 12): control, 0.15% rutin, A. hydrophila, 0.15% rutin \u00fe A. hydrophila. After 2 weeks of feeding with standard or rutin diets, fish were challenged with A. hydrophila for 1 week. The animals were then anesthetized with eugenol and euthanized to collect muscle. Dietary supplementation with rutin reduced A. hydrophila inducedhaemorrhage and inflammatory infiltrate in muscle of silver catfish. Although it was not able to recover the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), cysteine and glutamate cysteine ligase levels, it diminished the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) contents, thus decreasing GSSG to GSH ratio in muscle of silver catfish. Finally, such treatment reduced A. hydrophila induced-lipid peroxidation and markedly elevates ascorbic acid levels, re-establishing total antioxidant capacity in muscle of silver catfish. Redox disturbance and subsequent oxidative stress have been linked to the pathophysiology of first-episode psychosis (FEP). Coupled with depletion in glutathione (GSH), the primary antioxidant in the brain, FEP provides an early-intervention point for treatment. Exercise training can perturb oxidative stress and rebalance the antioxidant system in healthy participants, with potential to benefit an FEP population. The aim of this study was to explore oxidative stress as a mechanism by which exercise offers protection. 22 young men were recruited from Birmingham Early Intervention services and randomized to a 12-week exercise programme, or treatment as usual. Measures of GSH, markers of oxidative damage, inflammation, symptomology and lifestyle changes were assessed. Exercise had a positive effect on measures of protein damage, inflammation, symptom score and a self-assessment of disability. For markers of neurocognition, lipid damage and antioxidant ability, exercise attenuated negative effects observed in the non-exercising control group. Peripheral GSH was increased in the exercise group by 5.6%, and control group GSH was significantly depleted (P\u00bc0.04). Exercise training was affected by cannabis consumption, antipsychotic medication and BMI. Moderate intensity exercise training has the ability to elicit clinically important changes in oxidative damage and antioxidant concentration, with subsequent improvements in symptoms of psychosis. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is released by activated immune cells and forms the oxidants hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN). MPO and overproduction of HOCl are strongly linked with vascular cell dysfunction and inflammation in atherosclerosis. HOSCN is less damaging, reacting in a selective and reversible manner with thiols, leading to the hypothesis that thiocyanate (SCN -) may be protective during chronic inflammation. This project examines the reactivity of HOCl and HOSCN with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and the ability of SCNto influence HOCl-induced damage. Exposure of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) to HOCl and HOSCN decreased viability and induced altered intracellular calcium and apoptotic cell death. This was more extensive with HOCl and could be prevented by addition of SCN -. Both oxidants significantly decreased cellular thiols, but the oxidation was reversible to some extent in each case. HOCl and HOSCN differentially altered the expression of genes associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, with the changes seen with HOCl influenced by the presence of SCN -. Together, these data are consistent with SCNconsuming HOCl, to form HOSCN, which is less damaging to VSMC. This may have potential therapeutic implications for atherosclerosis. In the last years, several metallocifen compounds have been identified as promising anticancer drugs (1). We present here the comparison of some biological effects of two complexes of this family, 1 and 2, which differ only by the position of the metallocene (ferrocenyl) unit on the carbons of the double bond but show very different antiproliferative activity on breast cancer cells. Actually, while complex 1 exhibits a strong antiproliferative activity on breast cancer cells, 2 is by far less cytotoxic. In MDA-MB-231 cells, we found that complex 1, but not 2, was able (1) to increase lipid peroxidation (2) to decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential (3) to induce redox imbalance. In vitro, 1 and 2 significantly inhibited thioredoxin reductase after their enzymatic oxidation. Cellular amount of iron, quantified by ICP-OES was significantly higher after incubation with 1 than with 2. The differences of biological activities underline the essential role played by the ferrocene-ene-phenol motif in trans conjugation presents in 1 but not in 2. The antioxidants role in cell response regulation attracted great interest in the last decades and it is undergoing to a profound reconsideration. The mere concept of \"biological antioxidant\" has been frequently misconceived or misused, possibly leading to the misinterpretation of some experimental observation. Organosulfur compounds in general and \u03b1-lipoic acid, a dithiol molecule, can be considered a typical example of the kind. Reduced \u03b1lipoic acid, dehydrolipoic acid has been in fact originally considered a bona fide, reducing, electron donor molecule. A more recent approach, according to stoichiometric and thermodynamic evidences, lead to a reinterpretation of the biochemical role of \"antioxidants\". The electrophilic nature of oxidized nucleophilic molecules, including \u03b1-lipoic acid, renders more plausible a mechanism based on the ability to activate Nrf2/EpRE mediated hormetic response. In this study, we demonstrate that nmolar concentrations of oxidized \u03b1-lipoic acid, but not dehydrolipoic acid, protect human umbilical primary endothelial cells (HUVEC) from TNF-\u03b1 induced dysfunction, inhibit NF-\u03baB activation and block apoptosis following the activation of Nrf2 transcription factor. Our observations corroborate the concept that the major, if not the unique, mechanism by which \u03b1-lipoic acid can nonenzymatically exert its reducing activity is related to the electrophilic nature of the oxidized form.",

Evolution of antioxidant system: a comparative study on fish models Animals have to manage oxidative stress generated by their own metabolism and evolved detoxifying systems to oppose different oxidative stimulus. Although many studies have been conducted on the antioxidant system of mammalian cells, increasing evidence demonstrates that orthologous systems exist in other vertebrates, such as the zebrafish Danio rerio. Recent works indicate the advantages of zebrafish as useful model to clarify the crosstalk between oxidative mechanisms and inflammatory processes. The aim of this work was to investigate how the environment affects the evolution of defensive and inflammatory system. Specifically, we compared the blind cavefish Phreatichthys andruzzii, a teleost species evolved for 3 million years in extreme hypogean conditions in the phreatic layer of the Somalian desert, with the zebrafish. In paEPA and zfPAC2 cell lines, using Amplex Red assay and the treatment with glucose oxidase, we found a different basal oxidative status and a different response to induced stressful pro-oxidant stimulus between the two models. These results were confirmed by analysis of phase II antioxidant enzymes at gene expression and protein level. The elucidation of mechanisms involved in these processes could provide useful tools to expand our knowledge on the antioxidant-inflammatory pathways involved in pathogenesis of human disease. In our laboratory we evaluated N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) effects by its addition to cell culture media. We demonstrated that NAC inhibits adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Soto et al, 2017) . Here, we performed treatments with 0.01 to 5 mM NAC, on 3T3-L1 adipocytes (AC). NAC cellular uptake, in 5mM NAC treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (ACN-5), was only 17.4% of total NAC added. Highest NAC dose decreased total cholesterol content (Chol) (1.61 AE 0.50 g Chol / g protein [ACN-5] vs 5.73 AE 0.02 g Chol/ g protein [AC], p < 0.05). We evaluated cytotoxicity by colorimetric assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; none dose of NAC was cytotoxic (OD: 0.85 AE 0.02 [ACN-5] vs 0.81 AE 0.08 [AC] , no significant difference). We developed spherical porous silica nanoparticles (20 AE 4.5 nm), in which we encapsulated 5mM NAC (NPsSiO 2 -NAC), and evaluated their cytotoxicity. Samples of 0.05mg/mL showed 42.3 % cytotoxicity (OD: 0.41AE0.04 [NPsSiO 2 -NAC] vs 0.71AE0.04 [nontoxic control], p < 0.01); with a cover of bovine sera albumin (8nm) we obtained nontoxic NACnanoparticles (OD: 0.91AE0.09 [NPsSiO 2 -NAC] vs 0.90AE0.08 [nontoxic control], no significant difference). NAC release was completed within 28 hours. This tool for NAC delivery could increase NAC cellular uptake and its effect on lipid content.",

Oncogenic mutations in the RAS/RAF pathway are mostly involved in melanoma, with BRAF V600E present in 40-60% of all melanomas. Notoriously unresponsive and resistant to therapy, metastatic melanoma is highly invasive and evolved molecular defences against immunological and cytotoxic attack. Hence, new and most effective therapies are urgently needed. Recently, a new form of cell death has been described, with iron representing the main actor and lipid-ROS playing a pivotal role, named ferroptosis. This pathway might represent a new valuable approach to treat resistant malignancies, such as human melanoma. We found that most melanoma cell lines are resistant to ferroptosis execution. However, all resistant cells are competent to induce the early stage of this cell death program as described by the early upregulation of the main ferroptotic marker CHAC1, indicating a downstream block of the signalling pathway. In fact, we identified the involvement of aldo-keto reductases (AKR1C1\u00c43) as potential detoxifying enzymes responsible for downstream inhibition of ferroptosis execution. We also found that NRF2 plays a key role in both AKRs and CHAC1 gene expression modulation during ferroptosis induction and execution.",

This is a particular problem with heavily modified and cross-linked / aggregated proteins. While significant progress has been made, there is still a pressing need for methods that can quantify large numbers of low abundance species in a rapid and reliable fashion. We have developed a novel protocol using zwitterionic ionexchange chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to simultaneously quantify both parent amino acids and their respective oxidation products. Proteins are hydrolysed with methanesulfonic acid in the presence of tryptamine and purified by strong cation exchange solid phase extraction prior to analysis. This method represents a platform for the discovery of novel modifications and allows for simultaneous screening of large numbers of reaction products, both known and novel. The method complements existing targeted proteomic techniques, and allows precise quantification of the mass balance, or yield, of a broad range of oxidative modifications relative to parent materials.",

To better understand the molecular mechanisms of therapy resistance, a BRAF-mutated melanoma cell line was isolated from a patient biopsy and long-term exposed to increasing concentrations of Vemurafenib (PLX4032). Despite the resistance, the acute treatment with PLX of PLX-Resistant cells partially reduced the MAPKinase activity, suggesting that other signalling pathways are involved in chemoresistance. PLX-Resistant cells maintained an efficient oxidative phosphorylation and a reticulate organization of mitochondria up to 72 hrs treatment, while DMSO-Resistant cells acutely-treated with PLX showed a shift to glycolytic pathway and loss of mitochondrial reticulate organization. However, these metabolic alterations were not accompanied by changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both PLX-Resistant and DMSO-Resistant cell populations. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the acquired PLX-resistance confers to melanoma cells the ability to preserve the mitochondrial efficiency, suggesting that mitochondrial respiration should have a prosurvival role that limits the efficacy of the treatment. Further studies are needed to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying PLX4032 resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells (Grants from Genoa University). The development of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) applications increased the concern about their toxicity. As the respiratory system in one of the exposure routes, the aim of this study was to evaluate the AgNP harmful effects developed in lung. AgNP were able to cleave H 2 O 2 leading to OH production. In A549 cells exposed to 2.5 \u03bcg/mL AgNP a decreased mitochondrial basal and maximal respiration (p<0.01) were observed after 3h, while an increased H 2 O 2 production was observed after 1h (p<0.001), which in turn, increased the 4-HNE (p<0.01) and HO-1 (p<0.01) levels after 24h. In an EpiAirway 3D tissue AgNP exposure decreased the transepithelial electrical resistance (p<0.05). In vivo AgNP effects were evaluated using Balb/c mice instilled with 0.1 mg AgNP/kg body weight. Biodistribution evaluation showed the lung as the main organ of AgNP deposition, where 1h after AgNP exposure tissue O2 consumption increased (p<0.05) due to increased NOX activity (p<0.05) and increased mitochondrial respiration (p<0.001) mainly by increased complex I activity (p<0.01). Mitochondrial H 2 O 2 production rate increased (p<0.05) along with increased antioxidant enzymes activity (p<0.01) and decreased GSH/GSSG ratio. These results show that AgNP presence in the lung may lead to oxidative damage and impaired epithelial function due to O 2 metabolism alterations.",

To further evaluate RES effects on oxidative stress and on antioxidant defenses (Aox) in PBMC from NAFLD patients, PBMC were cultured in presence/absence of RES (20 ng/ml) for 24h. PBMC from NAFLD patients had higher baseline ROS levels (1353 AE 498 vs. 468 AE 89, vs. non-NAFLD cells). In addition, PBMC from NAFLD patients showed lower superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GRd) activities, and higher glutathione peroxidase activity (p <0.05) than non-NAFLD PBMC. 24h incubation with RES induced an increase in catalase and GRd activities (p<0.01), and a decrease in SOD activity (p< 0.05) and glutathione content (p<0.05) in non-NAFLD PBMC. However, RES could not modulate enzymatic activities in PBMC from NALFD patients. In conclusion, RES presence favored the decrease in ROS in non-NAFLD PBMC by modulating Aox enzymes and GSH redox state, but not in PBMC from NAFLD patients. Redox signaling alterations would favor the inflammatory state and the progression of NALFD. The regulatory mechanisms controlled by Res could be used as potential therapeutic targets in NAFLD patients. Support:",

In platelets, both Nox and PDI individually contribute to platelet activation. Understanding how platelets generate ROS and how Nox and PDI interact might provide better tools to treat and prevent thrombotic events. Methods: Human washed platelets and platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEV) were used. ROS were quantified using DCF and DHE dyes. Reductase activity was measured in whole platelets using the fluorescent substrate Di-E-GssG. Platelet function was evaluated through aggregometry and protein expression determined by immunoblotting. Results: PDI and Nox-1 inhibitors decreased platelet ROS production. Curiously, Nox inhibition increased platelet reductase activity while PDI and Nox-1 inhibitors synergized to reduce platelet aggregation. Various components of the Nox pathway were identified in PDEVs for the first time, which were shown to produce ROS in a Nox-1-dependent way. Importantly, Nox-1 and 2 were found to be enriched in PDEVs after platelet activation. Conclusion: Nox-1 and PDI are intrinsic enzymatic systems that synergize to modulate platelet aggregation. The enrichment of Nox-1 on PDEVs and its impact on ROS production suggest PDEVs could interact with other platelets through redox signalling.",

This effect was associated with increased proton leaks through uncoupling protein-3 activity and fuel combustion in muscles. Based on this, we investigated if the same phenotype exists in female GRX2-deficient mice challenged with a high-fat diet. Unlike male mice, female WT littermates were completely resistant to developing DIO and related co-morbidities. Additionally, deleting the Grx2 gene did not alter the weight gain profiles and adiposity in these mice. Furthermore, while differences in reactive oxygen species generation in liver mitochondria were observed, this trend is not present in muscle mitochondria. Measurement of mitochondrial bioenergetics also revealed no differences in fuel combustion or respiration in WT and GRX2-deficient mice fed a control or high-fat diet.

The functional and structural integrity of the brain rely on a prompt delivery of metabolic substrates (via local changes in cerebral blood flow) matching the increase in neuronal activity. The dysfunction of this process -neurovascular coupling (NVC)is suggested to critically contribute to neurodegeneration. Considering that neuronal-derived nitric oxide ( \u2022 NO) is a direct mediator of NVC in the hippocampus, it is hypothesized that modulation of circulating nitrite levels (via dietary intervention) may convey a pathway to sustain NVC under hypoxic conditions. To test this hypothesis in vitro studies were carried out to address the reduction of nitrite in acidic medium. In particular, chemiluminescence and electrochemical approaches were used to explore the production of \u2022 NO via nitrite reduction in the presence of several physiological reductants (eg. ascorbate, zinc, etc.). Parallel in vivo studies were designed to validate the hypothesis in a rodent model of vascular dementia, encompassing the evaluation of the functional impact of acute nitrate/ ascorbate administration in the neurovascular coupling.",

Stress can be caused by a variety of factors, such as the reactive oxygen species. The Growth Arrest and DNA Damage Gadd45a protein is involved in pathways that respond to various stressors, but its connection with oxidative stress (OS) remains elusive. Here, we study the function of Gadd45 in young and old mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) subjected to 300\u03bc\u041c H 2 O 2 for 30min and left to recover for different lengths of time. mRNA and protein levels of Gadd45 were calculated using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Number of centrosomes, mitotic defects and DNA damage levels were also assessed. Our results showed that in young MSCs, levels of Gadd45 increased for 1 hour after OS and return to basal levels after 24 hours. Old MSCs had significantly lower levels of Gadd45a and failed to adjust them in response to OS.

In conclusion, our results implicate Gadd45a in OS response and suggest a role for this molecule in the development of senescence features.

Methods: Among 69 women who were recruited to our study, 19 were first time diagnosed as type 2 diabetic, 24 were first time diagnosed as prediabetic and 26 were found healthy. Blood samples were collected at the time of their arrival to our hospital to calculate OSI after the measurement of TOS and TAS. Results: No significant difference was found in TAS values. However, TOS values were significantly higher in type 2 diabetics than prediabetics (p<0.001) and controls (p<0.005). OSI values were significantly higher in type 2 diabetics than prediabetics and controls (p<0.001 and p<0.05). Conclusion: Our findings of an increase in serum oxidant levels and OSI values in T2DM may contribute to further studies investigating the physiopathology of diabetes mellitus. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and dynamic intracellular reductive/oxidative (redox) balance play a key role in regulating cell survival/death. One of the significant features of cancer cells, when compared to the normal ones, is a persistent pro-oxidative state. In cancer cells, the events such as activation of oncogenes, aberrant metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction can increase ROS levels, leading to intrinsic oxidative stress. Therefore, malignant cells would be more dependent on antioxidants for cell survival and more vulnerable to further oxidative insults than their normal counterparts. This is the biological basis of redox-based anticancer strategy. In the current study, we have found that auranofin, a promising anticancer drug and known thioredoxin reductase inhibitor, induces cancer cell death through redoxmediated mechanisms affecting both thioredoxin and glutathione systems. Interestingly, cellular sensitivity to auranofin depends on intracellular antioxidant capacity. We have further identified that combinations of auranofin with several other anticancer molecules that increase ROS generation and/or affect redox homeostasis display synergistic anticancer activity both in cell culture and in mouse xenografted with breast cancer cell lines. Our data provide mechanistic insight and preclinical evidence that redox modulation and enhanced generation of oxidative stress could be an alternative anticancer strategy. Oxidative stress triggers the formation of lipid droplets (LDs) in the liver by stimulating lipogenesis and simultaneously suppresses lipoprotein secretion. Here we report that fasting causes an aberrant accumulation of LDs associated with systemic organ disorders in SOD1-knockout (KO) mice. After three days of fasting, approximately half of the KO mice were starved to death and could not be recovered by feeding, whereas wildtype (WT) mice were totally survived. The fasting also triggered organ failure such as increased rate of hydronephrosis and aberrant cardiac function in KO mice. Furthermore, LDs had accumulated and retained in KO mouse organs that routinely catalyze fatty acids via \u03b2-oxidation, although the levels of free fatty acids and ketone bodies in plasma were less in KO mice compared to WT mice during the period of fasting. Feeding a high calorie-diet for two weeks prior to fasting effectively mitigated its organ failure in the KO mice, despite the enhanced accumulation of LDs. These collective data suggest that the lipid-catabolizing system is the sensitive target of oxidative stress triggered by fasting conditions in the KO mice.",

Considering the important role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mediating immune and inflammatory responses, we verified if a mixture of oxysterols widely present in cholesterol-rich foods could require TLR2 and TLR4 activation to promote intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, the protective effects of cocoa bean shell (CBS) extracts with high polyphenolic content were also investigated. Differentiated CaCo-2 enterocyte-like cells were treated with a dietary oxysterol mixture and TLR2/4 gene expression and activation were analysed. Inflammation was evaluated by quantifying IL-8, IFN\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 cell release. Honduras CBS polyphenolic fractions (HFs) were characterized by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS. The HF anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in cells under oxysterol mixture treatment. We observed that TLR2 and TLR4 activation is required to mediate oxysterol pro-inflammatory effects. HF pre-treatments fully prevented the oxysterol-dependent cytokine induction, as well as TLR2/4 overexpression. These effects may be due to the high (-)-epicatechin and tannin quantities present in specific HFs. In conclusion, TLR2 and TLR4 can definitely contribute to mediate oxysterol pro-inflammatory action on intestinal cells. CBS fractions could be employed as anti-inflammatory food supplements, thus representing an important industrial design for recycling.",

The latter can lead to systemic inflammation and associated co morbidities. Diet is crucial in modulating intestinal inflammation. Among plant bioactives, ellagic acid (EA) was reported to inhibit inflammatory bowel disease in animal models. This work investigated EA capacity to inhibit tumor necrosis alpha (TNF\u03b1) induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) regulated loss of barrier integrity. Caco-2 cells differentiated into an intestinal epithelial cell monolayer were incubated with TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), in the presence of different EA concentrations. TNF\u03b1 triggered interleukin 6 and 8 release into the medium, which was inhibited by EA in a dose-dependent manner (IC50\u00bc17.3 \u03bcM for interleukin-6). TNF\u03b1 also led to: i) increased NOX1 expression; ii) decreased mitochondrial membrane potential; iii) increased oxidant production; iv) NF-\u03baB activation; v) MLCK upregulation; and vi) monolayer permeabilization. EA (10-40 \u03bcM) inhibited all these adverse effects of TNF\u03b1. EA mainly acts through NF-\u03baB inhibition breaking the cycle of oxidative stress, NF \u03baB activation, and intestinal permeabilization. This suggests the consumption of EA, via foods or supplements may afford a strategy to mitigate intestinal inflammation and associated comorbidities.

In our results, both GR and GPx were induced 24h after TAA, and the pretreatment with GD significantly reduced this induction, showing a profile similar to control. GD did not produce alterations in the profile of CAT, CuZnSOD and MnSOD.

We previously reported that human epidermal keratinocytes (HeKn) exerted paracrine protective effects on UVB-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in melanocytes (MC). In this study, we determined the protective paracrine effects of 5 skin cell types including HeKn, human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), mouse fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3) and epidermoid carcinoma (A431) on UVB-induced MC responses. The results showed that conditioned medium (CM) from 4 types of the skin cells except A431 cells reduced caspase-3 activation and ROS formation induced by UVB (250 and 62.5 mJ/cm 2 , respectively) as well as increased tyrosinase activity and melanin level in MC exposed to UVB (125 mJ/cm 2 ). In conclusion, 4 types of skin cells except A431 cells exerted modulatory paracrine effects on MC responses mediated by UVB in a different extent. HeKn provided the highest modulatory effects on UVB-induced caspase-3 activation, oxidant formation and melanogenesis in MC. Further study using systems approach (RNA-Seq and ELISA array) will be performed to identify possible paracrine factors responsible for the modulatory paracrine effects of HeKn. Disulfide bonds (DSBs), formed from two cysteine residues in proteins, are key stabilizing elements in many proteins. Changes to DSBs are postulated to play a vital role in determining the structural stability and biological activity of proteins. Kinetic analysis indicates that DSBs on proteins are significant targets for oxidants, however, relatively little is known about the oxidation of disulfides on proteins and the mechanisms of reactions that result in destruction of these residues. In the studies reported here we show that singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 )-mediated photooxidation of beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) yields thiosulfinates [RSS(\u00bcO)R'], which can subsequently react (after the cessation of O 2 exposure) with other thiol-containing proteins, such as glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), to form B2M-GAPDH cross-links. This novel cross-linked species has been characterized by both western blotting and mass spectrometry. Other disulfide-containing proteins (e.g. C-reactive protein, alpha-lactalbumin, lysozyme) previously exposed to O 2 also react with GAPDH and human serum albumin (HSA) to form novel protein cross-links. Overall, these data indicate that photooxidation of DSBs on proteins can generate long-lived reactive intermediates (e.g. thiosulfinates), that react with thiols on other proteins to generate inter-protein cross-links. These reactions may help rationalize the accumulation of cross-linked proteins in a number of human pathologies.",

However, contribution of Prx6 into the regulation of oxidant/antioxidant balance, that responsible for proliferation/apoptosis switching, under tumor growth is still poor understood. Here we studied PRX6 changes as well as cellular redox state during the formation of cisplatin resistance in human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells. The development of the drug resistance found to be accompanied by the increase of PRDX6 expression and growth of GSH/GSSG ratio due to elevation of GSH level, which needs for reduction of Prx6 oxidized form, as a result of enhancement of GSH synthesis de novo. In addition, it was established that siRNA knockdown of Trx1 increased CDDP-induced death of resistant cells that was significantly rose by additively use of siRNA knockdown of Prx6.

The eye lens is an avascular organ comprised of a syncytium of cells, the vast majority of which are devoid of functional organelles. To ensure lifelong clarity, the lens relies on a high concentration of chaperone crystallin proteins and a near hypoxic core. Photooxidation of lens lipids and proteins leads to an accumulation of oxidative insults; beyond a tipping point, these develop into light-scattering aggregates which form cataracts. Lens lipid membranes contain some of the highest concentrations of cholesterol described in any organ. Here, we demonstrate an effective method of mimicking known congenital cataractogenic human diseases in the developing zebrafish by disrupting cholesterol synthesis. Further, the relationship between lens sterols and crystallin proteins underpins both cataractogenesis and the resolution of light-scattering aggregates. We have investigated the chaperone potential of \u03b1-crystallin in different lens lysate preparations, and analysed the effect of sterol Tumors rewire their cellular metabolism in order to supply building blocks needed to support their rapid proliferation and growth. However, the role of metabolic processes in regulating cancer cells' aggressiveness is still unknown. We previously identified a set of metabolic genes which expression highly correlated with known mesenchymal markers. Among these, we identified glutathione peroxidase 8 (GPx8), an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein, whose physiological function is still unclear. Here, we assessed the role of GPx8 as a regulator of the cancer cell aggressiveness. We found that GPx8 up-regulation is dependent on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) program and that in various cancers, high expression of this gene correlates with poor patient outcome. Moreover, GPx8 knockout in the breast cancer-derived cell line MDA-MB-231 resulted in an epithelial-like morphology, downregulation of EMT signature and characteristics, loss of cancer cells stemness features, and tumor initiation in mice. We identified that GPx8 regulates the expression and secretion of several key autocrine factors promoting tumor aggressiveness, including IL-6. Thus, GPX8 loss compromises IL-6receptor signaling, resulting in cancer cells stemness impairment. Therefore, GPx8 regulates the transition of cancer cells to a more aggressive state, demonstrating the role of redox signalling in tumour progression.",

Two groups of patients were identified: group 1patients with acetic acid poisoning and toxic kidney damage, group 2patients with acetic acid poisoning without kidney damage. In neutrophils, the activity of catalase, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the concentration of AOPP were determined. A significant decrease in catalase activity was found in both groups. The activity of MPO in patients of group 1 was significantly reduced. MPO activity in patients of group 2 remained within control values. A significant increase in the level of AOPP in the neutrophils of patients of both groups. Conclusion: Based on the data obtained, we suggested that peripheral blood neutrophils were involved in the mechanisms of progression of kidney damage in case of poisoning. The decrease in the activity of enzymes involved in the implementation of the protective function of neutrophils (MPO), could indicate their inactivation or depletion of their adaptive potential. Thus, blood neutrophils were shown to be involved in the development of functional kidney damage when exposed to a non-specific toxic agent (acetic acid).",

One of the most important cellular defence mechanisms by which human skin copes with these numerous stressors is the Nrf2-keap1 defence system. All stressors share the same downstream effect within skin cells: increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations leading either to induction of oxidative damage (excessive production) or beneficial effect by activating the protective Nrf2-keap1 pathway (moderate production). Our premise is that the defence mechanisms of skin should always be active and alert. We hypothesized that skin microbiome and their metabolites and environmental moderate stressors are responsible for keeping the skin Nrf2-keap1 pathway partially induced and ready to cope with various insults. It has been shown that activation of the Nrf2-keap1 pathway is mediated partially by the presence of skin microbiome via its volatile organic electrophiles. Environmental stressors such as unique UV radiation, osmotic pressure, high temperatures can activate this pathway using different mechanisms. Skin's defence mechanism is kept under tight regulation and always in an alert condition to cope with stress. Moderate exposure to such stress conditions is beneficial for the human body.",

Despite extensive research, the role of autophagy in the development of fatty liver disease remains controversial, as autophagy regulates lipid metabolism and lipid droplet degradation. Transcription factor Nrf2 plays a protective role in fatty liver disease by regulating antioxidant defenses and lipogenic genes, which promote hepatosteatosis. However, the role of Nrf2, autophagy and their molecular crosstalk under lipotoxic conditions is incompletely defined. The purpose of this study is to investigate the cross regulation of autophagy and Nrf2-Keap1 pathway under lipotoxic conditions and to estimate their involvement in lipid droplet formation and cellular dysfunction. Therefore, we induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells by exposing them to palmitic acid (PA). According to our study, autophagy plays a key role in the lipid droplet content. Western blot analysis of autophagy-related proteins revealed an impairment of the autophagic flux. Additionally, immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis indicated increased p62 levels and activation of Nrf2/Keap1 pathway. Under these conditions, Nrf2 knockdown experiments are being performed to elucidate the impact of Nrf2 on lipid droplet formation and autophagy.",

We adapted StrataQuest software (Tissuegnostics) to detect the epidermis and its strata based on nuclear density mapping and distance-based algorithms. The sections were IF-stained for differentiation and proliferation markers. The activity assay for the enzymes G6PD and GAPDH was performed with enzyme specific substrates and a tetrazolium based chromogenic dye. We could predict with high precision the basal, first suprabasal and stratum corneum layers of human epidermis and in organotypic skin equivalents and verify the differentiation state with markers. We could assign enzymatic activity of G6PD to single cells within the predicted strata. Addition of Metformin two days before harvest led to a significant increase in G6PD activity, whereas UVB pre-exposure of embedded Kerantinocytes led to reduced G6PD activity. In conclusion, we were able to present an automated assay for epidermal image analysis and could prove responsiveness of metabolic enzyme activity to Metformin which is not only used for treatment of diabetes but also the most investigated anti-aging drug.",

Green tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) oxidative stress and DNA damage Carina Ladeira 1,2 , M ario P adua 1 , Carina Ramos 3 , Edna Ribeiro Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) antioxidant properties have been demonstrated however, increasing evidence indicates that EGCG produces reactive oxygen species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of EGCG intake during 90 days in hematological cardiovascular risk factors, vitamins A and E, DNA damage and oxidative damage in human blood. Peripheral blood from 30 healthy individuals (10 males and 20 females; 18 -45 years), was collected at time 0 (T0) and time 90 (T90). During 90 days, participant's ingested capsules of green tea extract (225mg EGCG) daily. Hematological cardiovascular risk factors including lipid profile and liver function parameters were assessed using colorimetric methods. Vitamins A and E in serum were quantified by HPLC and analysis of DNA damage and oxidative damage was performed by comet assay. Our results showed that lipid profile and liver function parameters are not affected by EGCG and serum levels of vitamin E increased, but not vitamin A. An increase of DNA damage and DNA oxidative damage after 90 days of EGCG consumption was also reported. The results suggest that EGCG can induce DNA damage, possibly due to ROS induction, with associated increase of the antioxidant vitamin E, however without alteration of hematological cardiovascular risk factors. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) reflects a spectrum of chronic liver diseases characterized by hepatic fat accumulation. Apolipoprotein O (ApoO) is a new member of the apolipoprotein family that may play a role in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial electron transport activity. We hypothesized that hepatic expression of ApoO is tightly linked not only to diet-induced hepatosteatosis, but also to oxidative stress and hormones. Therefore, we compared the effects of lipid loading on ApoO regulation in chicken (LMH) with those in human (HepG2) hepatoma cells. Incubation with oleic acid (OA) induced triglyceride accumulation, but did not affect cell viability. RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses showed significant increase in ApoO transcript and protein levels in both cell lines. Oxidative stress applied by H 2 O 2 revealed induction of ApoO in the same or even higher extent as monitored by OA. ApoO increased upon treatment with estrogen supporting the assumption that estrogen affects lipoprotein metabolism. Furthermore, both cell lines showed a significant decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential upon incubation with OA. We assume that our findings support a role of ApoO as an effector of compromised mitochondrial function that likely accompanies the onset of NAFLD. Ferritin has intrinsic ascorbate oxidase activity that is increased by low iron activities. UV irradiation of horse spleen ferritin solutions, buffered in citrate-(1mM), MOPS (50 mM), pH 7.0 at 295K with ascorbate (2.5mM) has contrasting effects when irradiated with UVC (250 nm) and UVA (360 nm). UVC irradiation generates a ferritin saturable increase in ascorbate oxidase (AO) activity, observed by a transient increase in EPR monitored ascorbate radical formation. This is followed by ascorbate peroxidase (AP) activity, seen as a steady decrease in ascorbate radical signal. In contrast UVA elicits no observable ascorbate oxidase activity but instead generates immediate ferritin saturable AP activity. In anaerobic conditions the UVC-dependent ferritin AO activity is abolished, but AP activity remains. With UVA the anaerobic AP activity is approximately 10x more active than with UVC. Catalase abolishes anaerobic ferritin-dependent AP activity with UVA and UVC irradiation but with both UVC and UVA, a low rate of AO is revealed. These tuneable UV dependent intrinsic ferritin ascorbate oxidase and peroxidase activities and their variable responses to low concentrations of ferrous ions are similar to those found with metal-based nanomaterials and may explain the intense inflammatory responses elicited by UV irradiation in skin cells. Frataxin deficiency is the pathogenic cause of Friedreich's Ataxia, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the increase of oxidative stress and production of free radicals in the cell. The onset of the pathology occurs in the second decade of life, however, cognitive differences and defects in brain structure and functional activation are observed in patients, suggesting developmental defects to take place during fetal neurogenesis. Here we describe impairments in proliferation, stemness potential and differentiation in neural stem cells isolated from the embryonic cortex of the Frataxin Knockin/Knockout mouse, a disease animal model whose slow-evolving phenotype makes it suitable to study pre-symptomatic defects that may manifest before the clinical onset. At molecular level, KIKO NSCs show protein and mRNA reduction of the transcription factor Nrf2 and, consequently, of its target genes. We demonstrate that by treating KIKO NSCs with two different antioxidant molecules, the rescue of Nrf2 and Nrf2-target gene expression occurs both in proliferating NSCs and in differentiation conditions. Although only partial restore of KIKO NSCs proliferation and clonogenicity is observed upon Nrf2 induction, antioxidant treatments are able to reestablish a proper differentiation program and rescue of neuronal complexity of FRDA neurons.",

The RPCD level in blood plasma of the 1st group was lower in comparison with control one (p<0.001).

Vemurafenib (PLX4032), specific BRAF-mutated inhibitor, is used routinely in chemotherapy, relapses can occur. Since heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is involved in chemo-resistance in different tumors, we have evaluated its role in limiting the efficacy of PLX4032 in melanoma under physiological normoxia and hypoxia. Moreover, the role of HIF-1\u03b1 and the angiogenic potential of melanoma cells after treatment has been analyzed. In this study, primary melanoma cell line (MeOV-1) was exposed to PLX4032. HO-1 was modulated by genesilencing or using tin-mesoporphyrin IX (SnMP-IX). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were used to evaluate the angiogenic potential of MeOV-1 supernatant. MeOV-1 cells were maintained and adapted longterm (5d) in an O2-regulated workstation under physiological normoxia and hypoxia (respectively 5-1 kPa O2). Adaptation to physiological normoxia/hypoxia didn`t affect the sensitivity of MeOV-1 cells to PLX4032 (reduction of cell viability of 45% and upregulation of HO-1), whereas PLX4032 significantly downregulated HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression. Furthermore, treatment of BAEC with the supernatant from PLX4032 treated MeOV-1 cells resulted in increased tube formation, branching and density. Our findings highlight an important role for HO-1 in favoring melanoma resistance to target therapy and promoting angiogenesis. Exogenous cannabinoids, mainly phytocannabinoids, such as cannabidiol, which is not psychoactive, but has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, may be suggested for the treatment of skin diseases. Therefore, the aim of presented study was to investigate the cannabidiol effect on ceramide profile of keratinocytes from patients with psoriasis vulgaris cultured in vitro. Lipid extracts were analyzed by RPLC-Q-TOF-MS to characterize ceramide profiles. Ceramide species responsible for changes in the profiles were selected by use of univariate and multivariate statistics. The relative abundances of sphingosine ceramides and dihydroceramides were decreased (~9-12% and~8-17%, respectively), whereas abundance of phytoceramides was increased (~7-24%) in keratinocytes from patients with psoriasis compared with cells from healthy subject. By contrast, decreased (~6-19%) relative levels of phytoceramides, especially those with long acyl chains were observed in keratinocytes from psoriatic patients after treatment with cannabidiol. Our study provides insights into the alterations of the keratinocytes ceramide profile in the development of psoriasis and may indicate the role of cannabidiol in regulation of keratinocyte membranes permeability.

The mitochondrion is called the powerhouse of the cell for good reason since it is responsible for satisfying the energy demands of most mammalian. This is achieved through the provision of ATP, which is made through the oxidation of various fuels and the establishment of a protonmotive force by the electron transport chain. Fuel combustion for ATP production is finely tuned in response to changes in cell energy demands. Importantly, electron fluxes in mitochondria must also be tightly regulated to safeguard cells from reactive oxygen species; molecules that are toxic at high levels but beneficial when generated in a controlled manner. Our group has found that a cysteine switch called \"protein S-glutathionylation\" plays a vital role in modulating the bioenergetics of mitochondria in several tissues. Here, I will present new findings from our group demonstrating that manipulating mitochondrial redox signals through deletion of the glutaredoxin-2 gene protects mice from diet-induced obesity and related disorders. This is associated with increased proton leaks, fuel burning, and ROS handling in muscle. Our findings suggest that targeted alteration of mitochondrial glutathionylation patterns may serve as a means to prevent/reverse obesity.",

It is formed by oxidation of xanthine and the reaction is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-iron sulfur flavoprotein. Mo is the functional center for this enzyme involved in the regulation of adenosine and its metabolites are important markers of ischemia. 30 atherosclerotic plaques of coronary arteries of hyperuricemic patients were analysed with FT-IR spectroscopy and SEM-EDX microscopy. The intensity of the band at 3270 cm-1 suggested that the atherosclerotic plaques contained a higher number of NH2 groups, and it was related with increased levels of uric acid in blood serum. The intensity of the band at 1735 cm-1 confirmed the formation of malondialdehyde. The intensity decrease of the bands in the region 1650-1500 cm-1 was associated with the decrease of ApoI/ApoII ratio. The band at 1467 cm-1 indicated the presence of urea components; result of the metabolic pathway. SEM-EDX analysis showed fibril formation and molybdenum (Mo) release in hyperuricemic patients. These findings indicate that superoxide anions reduce Mo cations to lower valance leading to inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity. The excess of uric acid increases the yield of peroxynitrite ions (ONOO-), which are implicated in pathophysiology of several cardiovascular diseases. Cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica L.

Our results indicate that a chronic exposure to UA induces a degree of lung inflammation that impairs mitochondrial function in distant organs, such as the heart, which worsens MI outcome. Taken together, our data highlights the importance of considering environmental factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases in urban areas. In the present communication, we show different experimental approaches used in our group for the characterization of the effects of anti-angiogenic compounds on the redox state of endothelial and tumor cells. Proteomics, Western blotting, determination of antioxidant enzyme activities and evaluation of global anti-oxidant potentials allow us to dissect the concrete involvement of anti-angiogenic compounds on the redox biology of the studied cells. We illustrate this approach with results obtained with the anti-angiogenic compounds homocysteine, aeroplysinin-1 and dimethyl fumarate.

Loss-of-function mutations of KRIT1/CCM1 predispose to familial cerebral cavernous malformation disease (CCM). It has been evidenced that KRIT1 loss-of function causes alterations of basal anti-oxidant and antiglycative responses. However, extracerebral phenotype of KRIT1 mutation has been poorly investigated. We previously demonstrated that a high-fructose diet generates oxidative stress and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in tissues, including liver and brain, leading to altered lipid metabolism and inflammation. We thus investigated whether KRIT1 loss-of-function may worsen the high-fructose dietinduced hepatic dysmetabolism. KRIT1-silenced and -overexpressing cultured MEFs revealed marked modulation of the lipid synthesizing enzymes. In parallel, KRIT1 loss-offunction in heterozygous knockout mice (EZ) was sufficient to induce hepatosteatosis with impaired expression of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and of AGEs-receptors and -detoxifying enzyme glyoxalase-1. A high-fructose diet administered to EZ mice for 22 weeks further enhanced lipid accumulation in liver and alterations of the AGEs receptors RAGE, AGE-R1 and galectin-3 and of glyoxalase-1, inducing a fibrogenic response. Our results indicate that the metabolic burden exerted by the fructose diet in heterozygous KRIT1 knockout mice further aggravates dysmetabolism, possibly involving glycative stress, suggesting that an unbalanced nutrition in CCM patients may result in worse metabolic disturbances than in general population.",

Clinical data indicate the significant role of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) polymorphisms in the development of ESRD. Aim: To examine the association of SOD2 and GPX1 polymorphisms with BEN risk and its associated tumors. Material and Methods: This case-control study was conducted in 207 BEN patients and 86 controls from endemic areas. SOD2 rs4880 polymorphism was analyzed using qPCR while GPX1 rs1050450 polymorphism was analyzed using PCR-RFLP. Results: Obtained results have shown that individuals with both variant SOD2 allele are at 2.6 higher BEN risk (OR\u00bc2.6, 95% CI: 1.15-5.85, p\u00bc0.021). Polymorphic expression of GPX1 is, neither independently nor combined with SOD2 variant genotype, significantly associated with BEN risk (p\u02c20.05). Regarding the risk of urothelial tumors in BEN patients, none of the polymorphisms studied was significantly associated with risk of these tumors in BEN patients (p\u02c20.05). Conclusion: It may be concluded that SOD2 enzyme might be an important player in preventing excessive superoxide accumulation in mitochondrial distress and induction of programmed cell death in kidneys during BEN development.",

The nitration of fibrinogen by ONOOis a potential biomarker. A mass spectrometry approach was developed to evaluate the nitration of fibrinogen and its implication in ischaemic stroke. A mapping of 3-nitrotyrosine and a relative quantification of it were made. Twenty different tyrosine residues were identified as nitration targets, after treatment with ONOO -. The number of 3-nitrotyrosine residues and the abundance of those showed to vary in a ONOOconcentration-dependent manner. The fibrinogen chains have different susceptibility to nitration. Nine peptides were found to be more frequently modified and their peptidespecific transitions were chosen to perform a targeted analysis in clinical samples. Three of the nine peptides showed a significative difference between stroke and control. The nitration pattern in-vitro is not the same as the one in-vivo. We aimed to study the role of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) on cytosol and membrane of red blood cells (RBCs) when catalase (CAT) is impaired.

Our results show that in the cytosol, GPx activity seems to be less effective as H2O2 concentration increases probably due to an accumulation of GSSG, as GSH regeneration is slow in the RBC. GPx binding to the RBC membrane with increasing H2O2 is most likely an effort to protect the membrane as GPx can remove hydroperoxides, contributing to LPO prevention.",

Hence, studies examined the mechanisms by which TCs alter the UPR in multiple cancer cells to suppress cancer proliferation and migration. These studies established that TCs significantly induced high levels of ER stress, increasing the activation of pro-apoptotic UPR signals (i.e., p-CAMKII, CHOP), while suppressing UPR survival signals (e.g., XBP1s, p58IPK). In contrast, redox inactive agent DFO and the ER stressinducing drug, tunicamycin, had little or no effect on these proteins. Moreover, it was demonstrated that anti-oxidants could inhibit TCmediated activation of the UPR, while pro-oxidants enhanced activity. Silencing the UPR reduced TC-mediated pro-apoptotic activity and migration inhibition. In conclusion, the induction of lethal ER stress via iron sequestration and the generation of ROS is crucial for the anti-cancer activity of TCs. Alterations of intracellular redox homeostasis, with the enhancement of glutathione (GSH) levels, and the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) are critically involved in chemoresistance. Moreover, CSCs express CD44 which is a staminality marker modulated by PKC-\u03b1 and which is able to influence GSH content by stabilizing xCT, a cystine-glutamate antiporter promoting GSH synthesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of CD44/xCT in the sensitivity of CSCs to etoposide, an anticancer drug with pro-oxidant effects. Therefore, CSCs were selected from HTLA-230, a human neuroblastoma cell line, and from etoposide-resistant HTLA (HTLA-ER) cells, and then were treated with etoposide alone or in combination with sulfasalazine (SSZ), an xCT inhibitor, or with C2-4, a PKC-\u03b1 inhibitor. A 5-week treatment of HTLA-ER CSCs with SSZ or C2-4 plus etoposide reduced cell propagation and GSH levels, also promoting glycolysis and lipoperoxidation whereas similar effects were observed in HTLA-230 CSCs after 2 weeks of etoposide and were not modified by either co-treatments. Collectively, our data demonstrates that targeting CD44/xCT, by reducing GSH levels, favors glycolytic metabolism, induces oxidative damage and could be an effective strategy for counteracting CSC chemoresistance (Grants from Genoa University).",

The senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a cocktail of inflammatory cyto/ chemokines and matrix proteases conveys the sescent cell signalling. However, the knowledge on lipid mediators which we recently discovered as members of the SASP is limited. We investigated whether the composition and amount of bioactive lipid mediators are altered in senescent fibroblasts. Using mass spectrometry lipidomics, we identified two lysophosphatidylcholines (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine and 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; lyso-PCs) to be significantly elevated in replicative-, and stress induced premature-senescence of human dermal fibroblasts and we were able to detect the same lipid species in cell supernatants. Telomerase transduced fibroblasts did not display elevated lyso-PCs even at high population doublings. When we exposed FB to lyso-PC, we found elevated expression and secretion of the chemokines CXCL1 and IL8. In monocyte lineage cells, however, lyso-PCs disturbed TLR2/6-CD36 signaling by the agonist FSL1 and uptake of labeled dextrane and therefore may interfere with the recognition of senescent cells. Thus, we propose that lyso-PCs contribute to the chronic pro-inflammatory environment not only directly, but also indirectly, by disturbing the clearance of senescent cells.",

Phospholipid-bound oxidized fatty acids inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory reactions more efficiently than the same oxidized fatty acids in their free forms Objective: Diabetes mellitus is a common endocrine metabolic disorder. The aim of this study was to evaluate the nuclear morphologic analysis in buccal epithelial cells using an exfoliative cytology in type 2 diabetic patients. Study Design: We performed light microscopic analysis of the buccal smears in thirty type 2 diabetics and thirty healthy individuals. The buccal smears were stained with Papanicolaou stain by using light microscopy (OlympusBX-51). In each case, the mean nuclear area, perimeter, length and width were evaluated in each smear using the image analysis software (Q Win, Leica\u2122). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: The nuclear area, perimeter and width were not statistically significant between the type 2 diabetics and the control groups. Only nuclear height was significantly higher in the diabetic group than that of the control group (p< 0.05).",

In the light of this study, several other studies may be planned to understand the interaction between diabetes and cell injury. Nowadays more than 90% of the urban population live with pollutant levels exceeding WHO standard limits and because of its critical location, the skin acts as a biological shield against various chemical/physical outdoor stressors, like environmental pollution. The protective ability of the skin is not unlimited and problems arise when this exposure exceeds its defensive potential. Recently a new player in the inflammation mechanism was discovered: the multi-protein complex inflammasome, a cytosolic receptor expressed also in keratinocytes that senses the environment and ultimately releases the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Among the several stimuli involved in the inflammasome activation there is the altered redox-homeostasis, which along inflammation, represents the common denominator of the development of several skin diseases. The topical application of natural compounds like blueberries has been proven successful to reduce skin-inflammation: our preliminary data shows that in keratinocytes, 3D models and human skinbiopsies, exposure to ozone induces gene expression and protein levels of several inflammasome-related markers. Pretreatment with blueberry extract, instead, decreases this expression, enhances epithelial woundhealing and reduce the formation of the oligomer-scaffold necessary for inflammasome activity. We hypothesize that blueberry extract can effectively reduce skin-inflammation therefore could be recommended as preventive approach against cutaneous pollution-induced damage. Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathological aggregation of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) into senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively. Currently, the search for peripheral biomarkers for AD that reflect AD-related processes in the brain has received considerable attention.",

Animals were exposed to O [0.8 ppm] for 2h (level found in heavily polluted cities) and two different approaches were performed: electrophysiological (patch-clamp technique) analysis in PG-DA cells, and behavioral analysis using olfactory habituation /dishabituation test. The electrophysiological results showed that exposure to O 3 induces significant alterations of the excitability parameters profile for the DA cells. In particular, changes in membrane resistance, membrane potential, reobase and chronaxia, after the O 3 exposure were observed. Behavioral tests were performed in two different strains of mice (C57BL/ 6J and Swiss Webster). Animals were tested for a series of social and nonsocial odors. Following the O 3 treatment, a loss of olfactory sensitivity to social and non-social odors was observed and sex related differences were also noticed. In conclusion, O 3 exposure seems to affect the excitability of the olfactory bulb PG-DA-cells, suggesting the deterioration of the olfactory function and this could be in part involved in the observed compromised social and non-social odors behavior considering that other olfactory cells can be O target.

Hyperoxic treatment (inducer of reactive oxygen species, ROS) was shown to support some tumorigenic properties, but finally suppresses growth of certain mammary carcinoma cells. While estrogen receptor \u03b1 cancers are more receptive to hormonal therapy, triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are characterized by an aggressive behaviour and the lack of targeted therapeutic strategies. Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), a major mitochondrial NAD \u00fe -dependent deacetylase, has bifunctional role in cancer tumorigenesis depending on the tissue and cancer-type specific metabolic programs. Due to strikingly reduced Sirt3 level in many breast cancer cells, we hypothesized it would have tumor suppressive effect in TNBC cells. Therefore, we stably transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with Flag-tagged Sirt-3 or empty plasmid and exposed cell to hyperoxic treatment. We are checking the expression of the proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolic regulation and antioxidant defence. Furthermore, we are investigating growth rate, metabolic activity and mitochondrial function through cellular respiration and FACS analysis. The surprising finding that Sirt-3 markedly promoted metabolic activity of TNBC cells, but reduced their potential to form new colonies and induced the mitochondrial ROS production compared to control cells gave us a rationale for more detailed studies on Sirt3 and hyperoxia as an adjuvant tumor therapy in TNBC cells. Cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) might affect both the development and the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Namely, conjugation of xenobiotics with glutathione may not necessarily result in detoxification, but instead in bioactivation, especially in the kidney. Additionaly, there are evidence on the involvement of GSTs, especially GSTP1, in the cellular survival, proliferation and apoptosis. In order to elucidate the possible role of GSTP1 in ccRCC, GSTP1 genotypes (rs1695 and rs1138272) were determined in 204 RCC patients and 280 matched-controls, in whom overall survival was also evaluated. The expression of GSTP1, regulatory (JNK1/2) and executor (Caspase-3) apoptotic molecules in ccRCC tissue samples were analyzed by immunoblot. The presence of GSTP1:JNK1/2 protein:protein interaction was determined by immunoprecipitation. GSTP1-variant genotype (rs1695) was significantly associated with the risk of ccRCC development and almost 2-fold increased hazard ratio in prediction of overall mortality. Haplotype C (*Val105\u00fe*Val114) was associated with 4-fold increased ccRCC risk. The presence of GSTP1:JNK1/2 protein:protein interaction was found in all ccRCC tissue samples studied. It might be concluded that GSTP1 polymorphisms might be associated with ccRCC risk, while the presence of GSTP1:JNK1 protein:protein interaction might be the possible molecular mechanism underlying the role of GSTP1 in ccRCC progression.",

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) affects the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and reductase (GR) in the liver of wfs1-deficient mouse Antioxidative defence system is governed mainly by glutathione and the enzymes involved in the metabolism of GSH.

Wolframin, a glycoprotein located in endoplasmic reticulum, regulates calcium homeostasis, and folding of proteins. NAC is a commonly used broad range medication and a known antioxidant. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NAC on the activity of antioxidative enzymes GPx and GR in the liver of 2-and 6-month old Wfs1\u00fe/\u00fe, Wfs1\u00fe/-and Wfs1-/-mice. We have previously shown that the administration of NAC affects the levels of GSH. The results indicate that the activity of GPx and GR affected by the administration of NAC depends on the progression of the disease. In younger mice the activity of GPx increases in Wfs1-/-mice and GR activity remains unchanged. In older mice GPx activity remains unchanged in Wfs1\u00fe/\u00fe, but decreased in Wfs1\u00fe/-and Wfs1-/-mice. GR activity is decreased in Wfs1\u00fe/-mice.

Metabolic adaptations in spontaneously immortalized PGC-1\u03b1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts increase their oncogenic potential PGC-1\u03b1 controls, the capacity of cells to respond to changing nutritional requirements and energetic demands. The key role of metabolic reprogramming in tumor development has highlighted the potential role of PGC-1\u03b1 in cancer. To investigate how PGC-1\u03b1 impacts tumor development we used the 3T3 protocol to generate iMEFs from WT and PGC-1\u03b1 KO mice. We found that PGC-1\u03b1 KO iMEFs formed larger and more proliferative primary tumors than WT's, and fostered the formation of metastasis. These characteristics were associated with the reduced capacity of KO iMEFs to respond to cell contact inhibition, increased ability to form colonies in soft agar, enhanced migratory capacity, and reduced growth factor dependence. These changes are associated with higher levels of nuclear \u03b2-catenin and c-myc in KO iMEFs. Evaluation of the metabolic adaptations identified a decrease in oxidative metabolism and an increase in glycolytic flux in KO iMEFs, which were also more dependent on glutamine. Glucose oxidation and TCA forward flux were reduced in KO iMEF, resulting in the induction of anaplerotic pathways. Analysis of aminoacids and lipids patterns supported the efficient use of TCA intermediates to synthesize lipids and proteins to support cell growth rates.

Hypothyroidism-induced MnSOD relocalization in early premeiotic germ cells in rat testes University of Belgrade-Institute for Biological Research \"Sinisa Stankovic\", Serbia Thyroid hormones affect male fertility regulating both, steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. Hypothyroidism in rats, from birth to adulthood, is associated with delayed maturation of the testis, impaired spermatogenesis, germ cells decline, and reduced seminiferous tubule diameter. Also, due to metabolically altered state testis is much more susceptible to oxidative stress, and high level of malondialdehyde, lipid hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated. The importance of the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in controlling O \u00c0 leakage from testicular mitochondria is well known, while its expression has been shown only in early post-meiotic germ cells. Hence, we aimed in this study to examine MnSOD immunolocalization in testes of hypothyroid rats. Two months old male Wistar rats were treated with methimazole for 7, 15 or 21 days. Control group received tap drinking water. Using immunohisto-and immunogold labeling we found that in addition to mitochondrial localization present in control and hypothyroid groups, strong MnSOD immunopositivity was also present in nuclei of early premeiotic germ cells after 7 and 15 days of treatment. Our results suggest a key role of MnSOD in protection of early spermatocytes against DNA damage in oxidative stress condition induced during establishing of hypothyroidism.",

We aimed to determine the potential role of GSTO1 and GSTO2 polymorphisms as determinants of postoperative prognosis in patients with the most aggressive renal cell carcinoma subtype (ccRCC). Furthermore, we assessed phosphorylation status of PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Raf/ MEK/ERK signaling pathways in non-tumor and tumor ccRCC tissue, as well as possible association of GSTO1-1 with signaling molecules known to be regulated by glutathionylation. GSTO1 (rs4925) and GSTO2 (rs156697 and rs2297235) genotyping was performed in 239 ccRCC patients, while ccRCC tissue and non-tumor specimens were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis ccRCC patients' carriers of GSTO1*CC (rs4925) genotype had significantly increased hazard ratio compared to the carriers of GSTO1*A allele (p\u00bc0.05). Expression of phosphorylated proteins of Akt/MAPK signaling pathway (RSK1p90 (pS380), Akt (pS473) and ERK1/2 (pY204/187)) was increased in ccRCC tumor compared to corresponding non-tumor specimens. What is more, immunoprecipitation has shown an association of GSTO1-1 with Akt, phospho-Akt (Thr308), and ASK1. The possible molecular mechanism underlying the role of GSTO1-1 in ccRCC progression might be partially explained by its deglutathionylase activity.",

Anthocyanidins promotes beiging of white adipose tissue in mice fed a high fat diet 1,2,3 Cecilia M Rodriguez-Lanzi*, 1,2 Eleonora Cremonini *, 1,2 Mirko Marino, 1,2 Dario Iglesias, 4 Angela Mastaloudis, 4 Steve Wood, 4 Shelly Hester, 1,5 Cesar G.

This study investigated the capacity of dietary AC to promote \"beiging\" of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT), through increased mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenesis. C57BL/ 6J male mice were fed control (C) or HF diets, with or without supplementation with 40 mg AC/kg body weight (CA and HFA). After 15 w, HF consumption caused obesity and increased eWAT weight, which were mitigated by AC supplementation. Adipocyte diameter was higher in HF than in C, CA and HFA mice. H&E stain showed images compatible with beiging in both AC-treated groups. Electron microscopy (TEM) showed a fewer number of mitochondria in HF but not in HFA mice. TEM findings were confirmed by measuring the expression of mitochondrial protein markers. AC prevented HF-induced inhibition of the pathway leading to mitochondria biogenesis (PPAR\u03b3, PRDM16, PGC-1\u03b1), and thermogenic respiration (UCP-1). Mice consuming the control diet plus AC also showed upregulation of PPAR\u03b3, PRDM16, PGC-1\u03b1. Findings suggest that consumption of selct AC could be an important strategy to mitigate HFinduced obesity in part via activation of adipocyte mitochondriogenesis and beiging. Oxygen and iron are essential for many fundamental processes of life including DNA and ATP synthesis. Nevertheless, dysregulated oxygen and iron can result in excessive formation of oxygen radicals that can cause tissue injury and death. Therefore, cellular oxygen and iron metabolism should be tightly regulated at all times. However, how this is achieved at the whole animal level is still mysterious. Here, we explore this question using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that the conserved iron-cage protein ferritin 1 (ftn-1) is differentially expressed in the intestine during hypoxia and reoxygenation stress. Intriguingly, we show that ftn-1 expression is controlled by oxygen -sensory neuron signalling. Furthermore, our data suggest that hydroxylated HIF-1 inhibits ftn-1 expression, while non-hydroxylated HIF-1 has no function in ftn-1 regulation. Finally, we demonstrate that ftn-1 upregulation in hypoxia protects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. Together, our studies provide novel insights into the way oxygen and iron responses are regulated at both the cellular and whole animal level. In the past decades obesity and the associated development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) became major public health concerns worldwide. \u03b2-cell apoptosis is central to the pathophysiology of T2D. Oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, both associated with consumption of Western-style diets and obesity, underlie \u03b2-cell apoptosis. We previously showed that the flavan-3-ol (-)-epicatechin (EC) improves insulin sensitivity in part by mitigating oxidative and ER stress in the liver and adipose tissue from mice fed a high fat (HF) diet. This study investigated both in vivo (HF-fed mice) and in vitro (INS-1 cells) if EC can mitigate fatinduced oxidative/ER tress and the consequent \u03b2-cell apoptosis. In vivo, EC supplementation prevented HF-associated pancreatic trygliceride deposition, enlargement of islets, and ER/oxidative stress. In INS-1 \u03b2-cells, palmitate (1mM) caused ER stress (activation of the three UPR branches: ATF6, IRE1\u03b1 and PERK). It also caused increased expression of NOX1 and NOX4, protein carbonylation, and activation of the redoxsensitive NF-\u03baB pathway. INS-1 cell apoptosis was evidenced by caspase 3 activation. EC (0.5-1 \u03bcM) mitigated or prevented all the adverse effects of palmitate in INS-1 cells. In summary, consumption of EC-rich diets, together with an improved lifestyle, can mitigate obesity associated \u03b2-cell dysfunction and T2D progression. Bacterial keratitis is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness globally. Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive invasive pathogen, is one of the leading causes of keratitis in India and worldwide. Because corneal infections due to S. pneumoniae are very aggressive irrespective of antibiotic sensitivity, we sought to investigate the host response with emphasis on antioxidant signaling. We determined the presence of oxidative stress in S. pneumonia infected corneal tissues removed during penetrating keratoplasty which indicates oxidative stress to play a role in pathogenesis of corneal infections. However, the task of NRF2 and antioxidant signaling in case of S. pneumonia keratitis is not well studied. Using our in vitro model of infection, we saw that S. pneumoniae generates reactive oxygen species in human corneal epithelial cells and impedes NRF2 activation. It also causes down regulation of expression of antioxidant genes like HO-1, and NQO1. Further, we found that S. pneumoniae induces Akt activation and inhibits autophagy in these cells. Using a known NRF2 inducer, tBHQ, oxidative stress was reduced and helped to restore autophagy in S. pneumonia infected cells in a NRF2 dependant manner. Thus, there is a prospect of treating S. pneumonia infections by exploiting its antioxidant signaling pathways. The aim was to study the early events that take place in heart mitochondrial dysfunction in a Type 1 DM model, in which hyperglycemia happens without the presence of insulin resistance, obesity, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Diabetes was induced by Streptozotocin (1 dose,60 mg/kg,ip.) in male rats (glycemia, C:130AE5, DM:413AE26 mg/ dl). Animals were sacrificed at day 10. The state 3 O consumption sustained by malate-glutamate (22%) and the respiratory control (39%) were lower in heart from DM animals, in accordance with the reduction in complex I-III activity (19%) . No differences in O 2 uptake sustained by succinate and in complexes II-III or IV activities were observed. H O 2 (96%) and NO (25%) production rates, and NOS expression (79%) were higher in DM group. Mitochondrial [GSSG\u00feGSH] was lower in DM rats, but there was no difference in GSH/GSSG ratio. PGC-1\u03b1 expression was similar in both groups, suggesting that mitochondrial biogenesis has not been triggered yet. After 7 days of hyperglycemia, heart mitochondrial dysfunction was observed, with complex I being the only complex modified. Linear correlations between the modified mitochondrial parameters and glycemia were obtained. H 2 O 2 and NO could be upstream molecules to de novo synthesis of mitochondria in response to hyperglycemia. Chemiluminescence is phenomena that occurs when a significant fraction of the exothermicity of a chemical reaction is transformed into electronic excitation energy of reaction product, which they can emit a photon light. Chemiluminescence can be split up into a chemiexcitation and luminescence step. photon emission from the intermediate process is a well-known as luminescence step which serves to announce the presence of an electronically excited state. in this study, we focus on the electronically excited state species. specially triplet carbonyl group by using a machine learning approach. This paper, shade a new light on the notion that metabolism and oxidative reactions are underlying processes which generate endogenous biological chemiluminescence. in the light of recent findings, one can contribute a novel method for non-invasive and label-free sensing of oxidative processes in biology. It is universally recognized that ROS hyperproduction with subsequent activation of the processes leading to formation of lipid oxidation products is a characteristic feature of oxidative stress. We have shown that besides oxidation ROS induce fragmentation of hydroxyl-containing lipids, such as lyso-phosphatidyl choline (lyso-PC) and cardiolipin, involving their polar component. Such processes occur without participation of oxygen and result in formation of new lipid moleculespalmitoxyacetone (PA) and phosphatidylhydroxyacetone (PHA), respectively. The mechanism of free-radical decomposition of lyso-PC includes the stage of formation of \u03b1-hydroxyl-containing carbon-centered radicals from the original lipid, followed by fragmentation with rate constants of the order of 107 s-1. Therefore, oxygen cannot inhibit reactions of this type at its physiological concentrations. Biological properties of PA and PHA have not been studied thus far. Using isolated rat liver mitochondria, we have shown that PA and PHA noticeably inhibited Ca 2\u00fe -stimulated processes of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition while increasing the rate of Ca 2\u00fe -induced membrane depolarization. Being negatively charged and more hydrophobic, PHA manifested more pronounced effects. The effects of PH and PHA might be related to their ionophoric properties.",

Role of advanced glycation end products, interleukin-6 and bone morphogenetic protein-2 on aortic calcification in diabetes type 2: a cross-sectional study Vascular calcification is a highly prevalent disease in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as compared to the non-diabetic population. However, its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Recent evidences suggest that calcification in T2DM is an active, cell-mediated process in which hyperglycemia, bone and inflammatory markers are involved in its initiation and progression. This led us to perform a cross-sectional study to investigate the relation of circulating advanced glycation end products (AGEs), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) levels on aortic abdominal calcification (AAC) in patients with T2DM (n \u00bc 104). All subjects were given lateral lumbar X-rays in order to quantify AAC (score 0-24 point) and the concentrations of AGEs, BMP-2 and IL-6 were determined in blood samples. Our results indicate that subjects with higher AAC score have higher levels of circulating AGEs (r\u00bc0.784, p<0.001), BMP-2 (r\u00bc0.579, p<0.001) and IL-6 (r\u00bc0.388, p<0.001), indicating that these compounds act actively in calcification process and posing AGEs as potential inducers.

Viability of human cancer cells treated with mDFO was assessed by crystal violet or annexin V staining. ROS production was assessed through fluorescent probes MitoSOX and DCF. Blue native electrophoresis and Seahorse were used to analyse mitochondrial function. The in vivo effect of mDFO was assessed by xenografting triple negative breast cancer cells in NOD/ Scid mice. Our results show that mDFO is at least 100-fold more efficient than DFO in killing cancer cells. In addition, mDFO was shown to reduce respiration and dramatically decrease the amount and composition of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes. Both the latter effects might trigger the observed increase in mitochondrial superoxide production, the fragmentation of mitochondria and the activation of mitophagy. Importantly, in vivo results show that mDFO is effective in slowing the tumour growth. mDFO represents an effective drug to inhibit tumour growth in vivo and might represent the lead compound in a new generation of anti-cancer agents based on mitochondrial iron chelation.",

SIRT1-dependent response is crucial for the resveratrolinduced upregulation of antioxidant and antiglycative defence in high glucose-challenged HUVECs Oxidative stress and glycative stress are thought to be strictly involved in the endothelial dysfunction that precedes diabetes-related vascular complications. Hence, researchers are increasingly interested in enhancing antioxidative and antiglycative protection in high glucose (HG)-challenged endothelium. Resveratrol (RSV), a natural phytoalexin, improves endothelial function upon HG, however it remains to be established whether RSV protects HG-challenged endothelial cells mostly via direct antioxidant effects or by modulating the major antioxidative/ antiglycative defence systems. More importantly, it remains to be demonstrated whether RSV-dependent effects require SIRT1, a NAD \u00fedependent deac(et)ylase critically involved in metabolic adaptation, DNA repair, cell survival and response to oxidative/glycative stress. In this work, we treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with HG (30.6 mM) for 24 h, with or without RSV or RSV\u00feEX527 (SIRT 1 inhibitor). Cytotoxicity, stress response-related changes in membrane dynamics, and expression/activity of SIRT1, as well as of the major reactive oxygen species (ROS)-and methylglyoxal (MG)-targeting detoxification systems were assessed. We found that the strong cytoprotective effect elicited by RSV in HGchallenged HUVECs strictly depends on SIRT1. Moreover, our results suggest that RSV protects HUVECs from HG cytotoxicity mostly by upregulating one of the major antiglycative defence (i.e., glyoxalase 1).",

We discovered inherent and adaptive protective mechanisms in VEC in diabetes: VEC, whose basal glucose transport capacity is significantly lower than in vascular smooth muscle cells, are less susceptible to glucose-dependent metabolic insults. Furthermore, high levels of glucose induce downregulation of glucose transport by increasing the expression of the protein calreticulin, which renders Glucose Transporter-1 (GLUT1) mRNA highly sensitive to nuclease degradation, and therefore reduces GLUT1 expression, and thus limits glucose influx. Nonetheless, prolonged and unresolved hyperglycaemic periods accelerate phospholipid remodelling and the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic and linoleic acids) intracellularly. These are transformed non-enzymatically by glucose-derived free radicals into 4-hydroxyalkenals (e.g., 4-HNE, 4-HDDE). We discovered that these aldehydes interact with PPAR\u03b4 to induce the expression of the pro-oxidant thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). The latter initiates and propagates wide-spread senescence in VEC. Immunohistochemical examinations of human carotid plaques have identified such senescent VEC on the cap surface. It is concluded that VEC tolerate well short-term hyperglycaemic excursions by the inherent autoregulation of glucose transport. However, chronic hyperglycaemia and oxidative environment induce cell senescence that often leads to cell demise and enhances atherogenesis.",

Moreover, the presence of mGSTP1 in the circulation is associated with tumor aggressiveness. It seems that polymorphisms in GSTs could also contribute to PC occurrence and progression, affecting both the proliferation capacity of tumor cells and response to therapy. In this study we evaluated the modifying effect of six specific GST gene variants (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1*A313G rs1695, GSTP1*C341T rs1138272, GSTO1*C419A rs4925, GSTO2*A424G rs156697), independently and in interaction with established risk factors on the PC risk. Genotyping was performed in 219 PC patients and 187 age-matched controls. As a result, GSTT1-null (OR\u00bc1.69, p\u00bc0.038), as well as all three variant GSTO2*G/G (OR\u00bc3.2, p\u00bc0.009), GSTP1*G/G (OR\u00bc2.45, p\u00bc0.012) and GSTP1*T/T (OR\u00bc5.62, p\u00bc0.036) exhibited increased risk of PC development. Additionally, association observed for combined variant GSTP1 and GSTO genotypes was confirmed at the haplotype level (GSTP1*G/ GSTP1*T, p\u00bc0.032 and GSTO1*A/GSTO2*G haplotype, p<0.001), suggesting a potential role of those variants in susceptibility to PC. In conclusion, the concomitance of GSTs polymorphisms may influence PC risk.",

Mitochondria isolated from the liver, kidney, brain and heart were subjected to the determination of total thiols, glutathione content and enzymatic activities of TrxR2 and GR and no significant differences were observed between WT and mGD animals. However, mGD liver displayed lipid deposits and liver mitochondria showed an increased ROS production, impaired oxygen consumption capacity, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and a higher sensitivity to calcium in the swelling assay. Interestingly, mGD liver mitochondria presented also an altered morphology. In fact, TEM analysis of liver tissue and isolated organelles showed \"donut-shaped\" mitochondria. Altogether, these preliminary results indicate that the lack of Grx2 in the mitochondrial compartment is responsible for the development of an early-onset fatty liver in which a decrease of mitochondrial activity associated to an increased sensitivity to calcium is involved.",

Paving the way for intracellular detection of free radicals with nanodiamond magnetometry Alina Sigaeva, Felipe Perona Martinez, Anggrek Citra Nusantara, Nikos Mougios, Romana Schirhagl Department of Biomedical Engineering, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands Free radical formation plays an extremely important role in normal cellular functions, as well as development of various pathological conditions. While more detailed information on the free radical production could give us new insights into these processes, it is generally hard to directly detect free radicals due to their highly reactive nature. Most common methods for free radical detection are not very sensitive and selective enough. They usually provide general information on the cell status, while the spatiotemporal distribution of free radical production is largely lost. Most importantly, these approaches rely on the reaction between the probe and the radicals, so they might be interfering with free radical signaling. Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) can act as nanoscale probes for magnetic properties of their environment. In this study, we trigger free radical production in mammalian cells with internalized FNDs and attempt to detect these elusive molecules by their effect on spin-lattice relaxation of nitrogen-vacancy defects of the diamond crystal structure. We compare this approach to the conventional methods for the assessment of oxidative stress and free radical production in cells. Our study serves as the first proof of concept for this novel application of FNDs as free radical detectors in live cells.",

It is postulated that simultaneous production of these two gasotransmitters leads to the formation of HNO, SNO \u00c0 , SSNO \u00c0 and polysulfides, resulting in the formation of complex reaction network with significant role in cellular signaling. Here we report, that the generation of nitric oxide in aqueous solutions of HS \u00c0 anions under aerobic conditions at physiological pH leads to the formation of peroxynitrite as a major reactive intermediate. We have detected and quantified ONOO \u00c0 in aqueous solutions of HS \u00c0 and NO donor (PAPA-NONOate) with the aid of boronate probes [e.g. coumarin-7-boronic acid (CBA) and boronate derivative of resorufin (PC1)]. The results of our study show that peroxynitrite is formed in H 2 S/ NO/O 2 system with the high yieldwe obtained the stoichiometry of 1 mol of peroxynitrite formed per 2 mol of generated nitric oxide. For better description of complex reaction network of NO/H 2 S crosstalk we have performed computer-assisted kinetic simulations. Oxidative stress response via Nrf2-mediated pathway serves as the hub between inflammation-and metabolism-related pathways in end stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed the association of polymorphisms in Nrf2, superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) genes with the risk of ESRD, and their functional significance in ESRD patients. These polymorphisms have also been evaluated, with GSTM1 deletion polymorphism, in panel designed to predict ESRD prognosis. Polymorphisms in Nrf2 (rs6721961), SOD2 (rs4880), GPX1 (rs1050450) and GSTM1 were determined by PCR in 256 ESRD patients and 374 controls. Eight biomarkers of oxidative distress were analysed spectrophotometricaly or by ELISA. Time to event modeling was performed in evaluation of survival. SOD2(Val/Val) genotype increased ESRD risk, which was even higher in carriers of combined SOD2(Val/Val)/GPX1(Leu/Leu) genotypes. Polymorphism in SOD2 showed an effect on oxidative distress. Overall survival in ESRD patients was dependent on the combination of the Nrf2(C/C) and GPX1(Leu/Leu) genotypes in addition to age and GSTM1 polymorphism. Obtained results might be relevant since significant associations between patients' age, antioxidant enzyme polymorphisms and survival were found. Our results support multimarker strategy in evaluation of ESRD patients' prognosis, which includes specific combination of biomarkers that reflect oxidative distress underlying ESRD and its complications. King's British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, School of Cardiovascular Medicine and Sciences, King's College London, UK Cytosolic labile iron pool (LIP) is normally held low to protect the cell from oxidative stress. As lysosomal proteases and iron acutely increase after UVA exposure and protease inhibitors reduce leakage of lysosomal contents and apoptosis, lysosomes are inferred to be the primary source of increased LIP. However, until now, the time resolution required to accurately assess whether lysosomal damage is a primary or secondary response to iron release was insufficient.",

The fibroblast iron signal immediately increased by approximately 100% after 8 kJ/m 2 UVA (360 nm) irradiation (P<0.001), whilst 10 and 40 \u03bcM ZnSO 4 prevented this UVA-dependent increase (P<0.001). The UVA response was exacerbated by superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitor, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate 4\u03bcM, implicating superoxide-enhanced ferritin iron release in the UVA-response. These results suggest that the UVA-dependent increase in skin fibroblast LIP is sourced primarily from ferritin iron and the subsequent oxidative stress may exacerbate the dermal cell ageing phenotype. NRF-2 is a transcription factor well known to provide an advantage for cancer growth and survival regulating the cellular redox pathway. In breast cancer cells, we identified the heme-globin Neuroglobin (NGB) as part of a new mechanism induced by 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) against oxidative stress. While there is mounting evidence suggesting a critical role of NGB as a sensor of oxidative stress, little is known about its involvement in NRF-2 pathway activation in breast cancer cells. In this study, we identify a new role for NGB in the cell response to oxidative stress. Although NGB is not involved in the rapid E2-induced NRF-2 stability, E2 loses the capacity to regulate the expression of NRF-2 dependent genes in NGBdepleted MCF-7 cells. These data sustain a role of NGB as a compensatory protein in the E2-activated pathway devoted to increase cancer cells tolerance to ROS generation in stressing conditions acting as key regulator of NRF-2 pathway activity in a time dependent manner. Pyruvate kinase catalyses the last step in glycolysis and may contribute to regulation of aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells, where there is a more prooxidant state. This state also favours lipid peroxidation and the formation of electrophilic fragmentation products, including short-chain aldehydes e.g. 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE), malondialdehyde and acrolein. As little is known about the interaction of these molecules with pyruvate kinase, we investigated their reactions with and effects on the activity of the enzyme. Analysis by LC-MSMS showed unique modification profiles for each aldehyde, with only Lys 393 and 475 modified by all 3 compounds. Acrolein was the most potent inhibitor, and at incubation times of 2 hours or more, pathophysiological concentrations (2-10 \u03bcM) induced significant effects. Treatment of MCF-7 cells caused similar losses of activity to treatment in vitro. Cys326, Cys358, and Cys474 were found to be modified in acrolein-treated pyruvate kinase, and as they are conserved residues located at or near the allosteric or active sites of the pyruvate kinase isoforms, they may contribute to loss of activity. These results suggest that reactive short-chain aldehydes generated during inflammatory diseases or environmental exposure could be involved in metabolic changes observed in cancer cells through alteration of pyruvate kinase activity.",

Oxysterol brain levels and Alzheimer's disease: the impact on astrocyte reactivity and neuronal health Evidence indicates that cholesterol oxidation products, named oxysterols, contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis through various mechanisms. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that several oxysterols progressively accumulate in AD brain as disease worsens. Astrocytes support neuronal functioning in many ways; evidence suggests that astrocyte reactivity is involved in AD pathogenesis since astrocytic inflammatory pathways are important mediators of changes in tau and synapse health. Yet the outcome of astrocyte activation is not completely clear. Two oxysterol mixtures were used, whose composition was based on our previous oxysterol quantification in mild (early AD) and severe AD (late AD) brain samples. Mouse derived primary cortical astrocytes and neurons were used as in vitro models. Preliminary results showed that both the oxysterol mixtures modulate astrocyte reactivity inducing the synthesis of Lipocalin-2 and SerpinA3N, both proteins identified as new potential reactive astrocyte markers. Alongside the increase in Lipocalin-2 and SerpinA3N synthesis, astrocytes showed a clear morphological change indicative of reactivity. Coculture experiments showed a significant reduction of the post-synaptic marker PSD95 protein levels and a concurrent increase of cleaved caspase-3 protein levels in neurons, suggesting that oxysterols could also indirectly affect neuronal health acting on astrocytes.",

Induction of selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) in the course of differentiation and maturation of adipocytes and H 2 S may augment adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. We found that SELENBP1 is induced when 3T3-L1 preadipocytes undergo terminal differentiation and maturation to adipocytes. SELENBP1 induction succeeded the up-regulation of known marker proteins of white adipocytes and the intracellular accumulation of lipids. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed predominant cytoplasmic localisation of SELENBP1 in adipocytes. In differentiating 3T3-L1 cells, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha likewise suppressed SELENBP1 induction, adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. However, lipid accumulation per se is not linked to SELENBP1 induction, as hepatic SELENBP1 was down-regulated in high fructose-fed mice despite increased lipogenesis in the liver and development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, SELENBP1 is a marker of cell differentiation/maturation rather than being linked to lipogenesis/lipid accumulation. As studies in tumour cells suggest that SELENBP1 counteracts proliferation and dedifferentiation, SELENBP1 may support the maintenance of a well-differentiated phenotype in mature adipocytes.",

Cysteamine has been shown to retard renal complications in cystinosis patients but it does not treat the renal tubulopathy associated with the disease. In this study, the effects of cysteamine on redox status, expression of redox-sensitive genes, nutrient metabolism, and Na \u00fe ,K \u00fe -ATPase activity were investigated in CTNS null renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs). Cysteamine markedly increased the GSH/GSSG ratio in CTNS null RPTCs, accompanied by a reduction in the levels of intracellular ROS. The expression of the redox-sensitive genes, NRF-2, HSF-1, and HSP70, was restored to normal levels following treatment with cysteamine. Cysteamine enhanced the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and intracellular ATP production. Conversely, cysteamine did not improve the Na \u00fe ,K \u00fe -ATPase activity. Glucose and glutamine metabolism were also unaffected in the presence of cysteamine. The results indicate that cysteamine can improve the antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial function in RPTCs with CTNS gene deletion. However, lysosomal cystine accumulation alone may not be obligatory for the manifestation of some biochemical alterations in cystinosis. This may partly explain the persistence of renal Fanconi syndrome in cystinosis patients despite strict adherence to cysteamine therapy.",

Antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 and the circadian molecular clock interact in a tissue-specific, bi-directional manner NRF2 is the master mediator of protective antioxidant responses in many tissues. Disruption of NRF2 pathway is linked to many diseases associated with oxidative stress. Research from our lab identified Nrf2 as a clock-controlled gene, which leads to daily oscillations in NRF2 activation on target gene promoters. However, it is not known what impact Nrf2 pathway has upon molecular clock in different tissues in vivo. We investigated clock gene expression in Nrf2 KO mice over 24hrs in peripheral tissues. Nrf2 KO mice show tissue-specific changes in select clock gene loops and shorter periodicity in wheel-running behaviour. This was consistent with real-time bioluminescence imaging of Nrf2 KO/ Per2::luc reporter mice which showed altered rhythmicity of peripheral tissues. Loss-and gain-of-function experiments in human cells revealed acute effects of Nrf2 modulation on clock genes. Cell-autonomous changes in clock gene rhythms were recapitulated in primary MEFs from Nrf2 KO mice. Pharmacological intervention using Nrf2 activators led to significant changes in clock genes in a time-of-day manner in vivo. These results demonstrate tissue-specific, bi-directional regulation between NRF2 and the molecular clock. These novel findings suggest that altered circadian clock as a result of NRF2 dysregulation may contribute to tissue deterioration in ageing and chronic diseases.",

In this regard, the chalcone cardamonin has recently been identified as inducer of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant enzymes, two of them being selenoenzymes. We investigated a potential interplay between the cellular selenium (Se) status and the Nrf2 signaling pathway, using HepG2 cells cultured under Se-deficient, Se-adequate and Se-supranutritional conditions. Expression of selected Nrf2 target genes was measured by qRTPCR and immunoblotting. Cellular Nrf2 localization was detected by immunoblotting after cytoplasmic/nuclear fractionation. Sulforaphane (SFN), a well-known plant-derived Nrf2-activator, and diethyl maleate (DEM), a thiolmodulating chemical, served as controls. Treatment with the three substances resulted in rapid induction of Nrf2 and its enrichment in the nucleus, independent of the cellular Se status. All three compounds caused an up-regulation of Nrf2 target genes, although with differences regarding extent and time course of their induction. The most pronounced induction of the selected Nrf2 target genes, with up to 20-fold increase in gene expression, was observed for HMOX1/HO-1.

Previously, we observed that the cerebrosterol 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC) reduces the accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein upregulating the neuroprotective deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells. We are now investigating how the 24-OHC might modulate tau levels. We have shown that 24-OHC, through the activation of the axis SIRT1/ PGC1\u03b1/Nrf2, promotes tau deacetylation and ubiquitination, key events leading to tau proteasomal degradation, with the consequent decrease of both phosphorylated and total tau levels. We have demonstrated that 24-OHC, via SIRT-1/PGC1\u03b1 activation, induces a significant up-regulation of both Nrf2 expression and synthesis. Moreover, 24-OHC leads to a decrease of Nrf2/Keap1 complex inducing a nuclear translocation of Nrf2, with the consequent increase of transcription levels of antioxidant proteins (i.e. HO-1, NQO1) able to counteract oxidative stress. In conclusion, the administration of 24-OHC, as Nrf2 activator, may provide a therapeutic strategy aimed at reducing tau accumulation and oxidative damage, both promising targets in AD prevention.",

One of the important questions is how N-NA are brought, formed and transmitted from the upper gastrointestinal tract (GI) to the lower GI compartments. We suggest a novel possibility by which proteins and amino acids can function both as nucleophiles and as intermediate substrates to facilitate N-NA formation in situ within the GI tract. Interestingly, the colonic and meat products ambient conditions of pH of about 6.0 and low oxygen levels make the S to N transnitrosation reactions to form N-NA extremely relevant. In the presence of secondary amines and independent of metal catalysis, nucleophiles accelerated N-NA formation from S-nitrosocysteine (Cys-SNO), and that blocking the agonists by targeting either NOX1 (for collagen) or NOX2 (for thrombin). Selective inhibition of either NOX1 or NOX2 impairs the potentiatory effect of tested platelet modulators (oxLDL and A\u03b2), but does not completely abolish platelet haemostatic function. This information offers new opportunities for the development of disease specific antiplatelet drugs with limited bleeding side effects by selectively targeting NOXs.",

Novel NADPH oxidase 1-selective inhibitors impair collagendependent platelet activation and thrombus formation in vitro and ferric chloride-induced carotid occlusion in vivo with negligible effects on thrombin responses and bleeding time Dina Vara 1 , Anuradha Tarafdar , Lorenzo Caggiano , and Giordano Pula The NOX1-selective inhibitor 2-acetyl phenothiazine (2-APT) can inhibit collagen-dependent platelet responses in vitro. We synthesised a series of novel chemical derivatives with improved physicochemical profile compared to 2-APT and tested their ability to affect platelet responses both in vitro and in vivo. Amongst these new compounds, 2APT-PD06, showed the highest in vitro potency as inhibitor of collagen-dependent platelet activation. When administered in mice, 2APT-PD06 inhibited collagen-dependent aggregation in platelet rich plasma (PRP) and thrombus formation under flow in whole blood. Carotid occlusion time was also significantly increased, while tail bleeding time was only marginally affected. The effect of 2APT-PD06 reproduced the functional phenotype observed for genetically silenced NOX1 -/mice (reduced collagen response in vitro and reduced carotid occlusion in vivo). This study describes a novel NOX1 inhibitor able to target collagendependent platelet responses in vitro and carotid occlusion in vivo. The limited effect on thrombin-induced responses in vitro and tail bleeding time in vivo, supports the hypothesis that NOX1 is dispensable for platelet activation in response to thrombin and for the haemostatic response induced by acute vascular injury, while it is essential for collagendependent platelet activation and vascular occlusion induced by endothelial cell damage. The fast-expansion of studies on ferroptosis have highlighted inhibition of the xCT transporting subunit of the cystine-glutamate antiporter (x csystem) as a potent ferroptosis-inducer for anticancer therapy.

Consequently, cells cultured under room air conditions are hyperoxic. We reported that long-term culture under 5% O 2 , results in a phenotype different to cultures under 18% O evidenced by downregulation of specific Nrf2 target genes. The phenotype of bEnd.3 microvascular endothelial was characterized following longterm (5 days) culture under 5% (normoxia) or 18% (hyperoxia) O 2 . Using an oxygen sensitive nanoparticle probe (MitoXpress-Intra), the intracellular O 2 level in bEnd.3 cells was 3.6% when cultured under 5% O 2 . Administration of an Nrf2 inducer, sulforaphane (2.5 \u03bcM), significantly reduced superoxide burst associated with reperfusion injury in cells cultured initially under 18% O 2 , 1% O 2 (1h) and reoxygenation (18% O 2 ), as measured with L-012 luminescence. Notably, adaptation of bEnd.3 cells to physiological normoxia (5% O 2 ) prevented superoxide production associated with ischaemia-reperfusion injury in cells initially adapted to 18% O 2 . Our findings highlight the importance of conducting vascular cell culture under physiological normoxia to recapitulate the redox phenotype of brain microvascular endothelial cells in vivo.

We investigated the relationship between plasma levels of nutrition-and antioxidant defense-related biomarkers carotenoids and tocopherols and both indicators of cognitive and physical performance in persons with mild cognitive impairment participating in the JPND NeuroExercise Study at the German Sport University. In 56 participants with full dataset, significant correlations independently of fruit and vegetable intake were found between levels of \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and Timed Up&Go test (p< 0.05), of \u03b3-tocopherol and number of daily steps (p< 0.01), as well as between lutein, zeaxanthin, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and \u03b2-carotene and the computerized CogState International Shopping List subtest (p < 0.01).

ETs consist of mesh of DNA, histones, myeloperoxidase and proteolytic enzymes, which are involved in bacterial killing. However, ETs also promote inflammation and contribute to pathological processes, including atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to examine whether macrophages also release ETs on exposure to inflammatory stimuli, because these cells play a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis. We show that exposure of human monocyte-derived macrophages to HOCl results in the dose-dependent extrusion of DNA and histones into the cellular supernatant, consistent with ET formation. Unlike neutrophils, ET release from HMDM occurs independently of histone citrullination, but does involve cytosolic accumulation of calcium. Polarisation of the macrophages prior to HOCl exposure revealed a greater propensity for inflammatory M1 macrophages and not alternatively-activated M2 macrophages, to produce ETs. M1 macrophages also produced ETs on exposure to other inflammatory stimuli, including interleukin-8 and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1. These data indicate a potential role for macrophage ET formation during chronic inflammation, which could be relevant for atherosclerosis.",

Despite its relevance in the cardiovascular pathophysiology, the source(s) of ROS, its nature and function have not been explored yet. We have investigated the mechanism of ROS generation upon activation of \u03b1and \u03b2-ARs in H9c2 and reconstituted HEK293 cells. Adrenergic stimulation induced DCFH-DA sensitive ROS and its level was more when they were added separately as compared to respective combinations of agonists and antagonists. In all the cases, H2O2 was generated in the cytosol and superoxide in the mitochondria. The role of NOX2 in ROS generation was demonstrated by its selective inhibition by the peptide gp91-ds-tat. The activation of NOX2 was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and the membrane translocation of the p47-Phox subunit. Its effect on the downstream signalling and gene expression was assayed by immunoblotting and promoter-reporter assay. ROS generated by all the agonists and antagonists regulated downstream gene expression in a similar but distinctive manner. Thus, generation of ROS is an integral part of signalling by the \u03b1and \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. ",

Melanoma originates from skin melanocytes, rapidly metastasizes due to modulation of various kinase-based signal transduction pathways. Some of the involved signal transduction proteins are activated by reactive oxygen species and phosphorylation: they mediate signals for proliferation and migration of melanoma cells. In this study, we explored the potential of a newly synthesized and fully characterized novel bis-coumarin derivative as a potential anti-melanoma, anti-metastatic agent by utilizing various human malignant cell lines. To this end, we have used a \"four-focus area strategy\" to evaluate the biscoumarin derivative (i) cytotoxicity against various metastatic and nonmetastatic melanoma cell lines, and its effect on non-cancerous cell lines, (ii) inhibition of melanoma cell migration (iii) inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation (iv) potential to modulate ROS dependent and independent kinase-mediated signaling cascades. It appears that this and similar bis-coumarins derivatives could be used to control kinase phosphorylation with the aim to prevent, and/or treat, melanoma with minimal unwanted side effects.Although many plant-derived antioxidants can exert an important role in several disease therapy and prevention, usually unfavourable physicochemical features compromise their use. The emulsification of glyceryl monooleate in water in the presence of surfactants gives rise to the formation of nanostructured lipid dispersions suitable for solubilization and delivery of low soluble active molecules. At this regard, in this study crocin and curcumin have been solubilized and loaded within nanostructured lipid dispersions designed to treat skin inflammatory conditions. The use of poloxamer, sodium cholate or sodium caseinate as stabilizers resulted in dispersions constituted of cubosomes, hexasomes, sponge systems or vesicles, as detected by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. Franz cell studies demonstrated the suitability of nanostructured lipid dispersions to control crocin and curcumin permeation through the skin, while shelf life tests evidenced their capability to retard antioxidant degradation. Notably, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay pointed out that both crocin and curcumin prolonged their antioxidant activity when loaded in nanostructured lipid dispersions. Furthermore, the MTT test evidenced that the nanostructures increased crocin antiproliferative activity towards a human melanoma cell line, while Western blot analysis, performed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of nanoencapsulated curcumin towards iNOS expression, demonstrated a prolonged antioxidant/antinflammatory activity. 2-Hexadecenal (2HD)a biologically active aldehyde, which level can rise under oxidative stress conditions. A number of processes leading to the formation of 2HD from sphingolipids have been established to date: biochemical cleavage of sphingosine-1-phosphate, photochemical destruction of sphingomyelin, as well as ROS and HOCl-induced fragmentation of sphingosine. A wide range of reactions leading to the accumulation of 2HD in biosystems motivates to study its properties. It has been shown that 2HD inhibits growth of C6 glioma cells due to modification of intracellular processes of signal transduction, cytoskeleton rearrangement, change in the mitotic regimen and apoptosis induction. These effects are associated with modification of cells' redox activity. In the early stages of interaction with cells, 2HD increases the production of superoxide anion radicals by mitochondria and decreases the intracellular level of reduced glutathione. Cells treatment with 2HD for 24 h causes a significant increase in ROS production due to activation of cytosol enzymes including stress-activated MAPK. Since HOCl hyper production in the brain occurs in a number of pathologies associated with the development of inflammation (neurodegeneration, stroke, cancer) 2HD can be considered as a new marker of oxidative stress.",

In the process of oxidative stress iodide can have a protective or damaging effect that will influence the fate of oxidative protein modification. In this study we have investigated the mechanism of oxidation of lysozyme and several cytokinin-specific binding proteins from plants by HOCl in the presence of iodide ions, in order to characterize whole scenario from harmlessness to hazardous level of iodide in oxidative stress. Results obtained from SDS-PAGE, chromatography, mass spectrometry and western blot show inhibition of protein aggregation associated to e.g. prevention of dityrosine formation as a result of iodination of tyrosine. In addition, enzymatic and binding assays were applied to observe the effect of iodide on the activity of proteins. X-ray diffraction will be used to study. Quinones are a common motif in many biological compounds, and can react with nucleophiles, such as protein cysteine (Cys) residues via Michael addition reactions. The selenyl anion of selenocysteine (Sec) is a stronger nucleophile and more reactive than the thiol group of Cys. We therefore hypothesized that Sec residues should be modified by quinones and affect selenoprotein structure and function. This was investigated using p-benzoquinone (BQ) and the selenoproteins, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Incubation of purified proteins, cell lysates, or intact J774A.1 cells, with BQ resulted in a rapid and concentration-dependent loss of TrxR, but not GPx enzymatic activity. BQ also induced a concentration-dependent dimerization of TrxR but not GPx. Further experiments indicated that BQ modifies the Sec and Cys residues of both TrxR and GPx in a partly-reversible manner, with glutathione (GSH) able to prevent (by competitive reaction with BQ) or reverse (by S-glutathionylation) the loss of enzyme activity and dimerization of TrxR. GSH is a co-factor for GPx, explaining the lack of inhibition of GPx by BQ. These data suggested that BQ could selectively and reversibly modify Sec residues of selenoproteins, but the downstream consequences were dependent on the protein structure and its catalytic mechanism.",

For the first time we propose that this nucleophile dependent pathway is involved in generation of N-NA in the presence of secondary amines. Due to S to N transnitrosation these compounds can form the unusable highly reactive intermediates that will generate N-NA by direct reactions. Oxidative stress is one of the main factors in the onset and progression of some hepatic, cardiovascular and renal diseases. It is well known that the master gene in the regulation of the cellular antioxidant response is the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). In this work, we evaluate the effect of Croton hypoleucus (EC), known as \"Palo blanco\" (native shrub of Hidalgo, M exico), on Nrf2 and catalase expression, in a thioacetamide (TAA) induced liver damage model, to find out the probable mechanism of the hepatoprotective activity previously found by our group in EC extract against acute damage by TAA. Four groups were established: EC, TAA, EC TAA and a Control group. For EC TAA, wistar rats (6 weeks old) were intragastrically pre-administered for 4 days with EC (300 mg/day) and the last day a single dose (400 mg/kg) of TAA (i.p.). At 24 h after of damage induction, animals were sacrificed. Liver homogenate was used to evaluate mRNA expression by qRT-PCR protocols. The results showed that EC TAA group did not enhance the gene expression of Nrf2, while catalase maintained its levels closer to control in the same group. Therefore, EC has antioxidant effect no dependent of Nrf2 pathway. The superoxide anion production by cytochrome b 5 reductase (Cb 5 R) can be stimulated by cytochrome c 1,2 , but very little is known about other potential activators of this production by Cb 5 R. A drug screening against the NADH:ferricyanide reductase activity of recombinant human erythrocyte enzyme allowed us to find that 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was able to inhibit the reduction of ferricyanide by Cb 5 R. A further characterization of the system showed that 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was indeed able to act as an electron acceptor of the reductase and promote the formation of superoxide anion. Our results allow us to rationalize the toxic effect of this compound in eryptosis and further reveal Cb 5 R as an overseen target, in cellular conditions, inducing oxidative stress 3 . References The regulation of platelets by oxidants is critical for vascular health and may explain thrombotic complications in diseases such as diabetes and vascular dementia, but remains poorly understood. Using selective peptide inhibitors of NADPH oxidases (NOXs) on human platelets and genetically modified mouse platelets (NOX1 -/or NOX2 -/-), we discovered that: 1) intracellular but not extracellular superoxide anion generated by NOXs is critical for platelet activation by collagen; 2) superoxide dismutation to hydrogen peroxide is required for thrombindependent activation; 3) NOX1 is the main source of oxygen radicals in response to collagen, while NOX2 is critical for activation by thrombin; 4) oxidised low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) and amyloid peptide \u03b2 (A\u03b2), two modulators of platelets associated with vascular complications of hyperlipidemia and dementia, require contemporaneous activation of NOX1 and NOX2 to pre-activate platelets. This study suggests the possibility of selectively inhibiting platelet ",

Trx/TrxR system in redox-dependent regulation under development of cisplatin resistance in cancer cells Elena Kalinina 1 , Yaroslav Andreev 2 , Albina Petrova 1 , Alexander Shtil 3 , Nikolai Chernov 1 , Maria Novichkova 1 . Blokhin National Medical Research Center of Oncology, Moscow, Russian Federation Trx/TrxR-regulatory redox pathways may be the significant part of key events in the stress response and/or resetting redox homeostasis resulted in the change of most vital functions of cells, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis. Here we studied a level of Trx/TrxR activity and cellular redox-dependent changes during the development of resistance in human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells to cisplatin that possesses prooxidant effect. Increase of TRX1, TRXDR1, TRXDR2 gene expression as well as Trx and TrxR activity was found under formation of cancer cell resistance. The alteration of Trx/TrxR system was detected together with a change of the balance ROS/antioxidants in favor of growth of antioxidant state due to increase of key antioxidant enzymes gene expression (SOD2, CAT, GPX1, HO-1) and decrease of NADPH oxidase (NOX5) expression. Apoptosis suppression and much smaller extent of ASK1 and JNK1 phosphorylation were observed in resistant SKOV3/ CDDP cells in contrast to the wild cells under H2O2 treatment. The results testify in favor of the important role of Trx/TrxR system in the rise of adaptive antioxidant response under formation of cisplatin resistance in cancer cells.

In environment of chronic inflammation, microglia (cells of immune system in CNS) are immunologically activated and contribute themselves to increased neuroinflammation. Moreover, cellular senescence is a process critically participating in ageing, characterised by loss of proliferation, alterations in mitochondrial and lysosomal functions and defects in autophagy. All mentioned processes are responsible for propagation of age-related diseases. Electrophilic compounds have shown positive effect as therapeutic approach in restoration of imbalanced redox homeostasis and developed inflammation because of their capability to induce nucleophilic status of the cell by activation of defensive molecular mechanisms and thus supress oxidative conditions. Our study investigates efficacy of synthetic flavonoid derivative, 4-O-(2-chloro-1,4-naphtoquinone-3-yloxy) quercetin (CHNQ) at sub-toxic and non-damaging concentration to mitigate activation of microglia as well as to downregulate senescence hallmarks in replicative senescent human fibroblasts. CHNQ in LPS-activated microglia downregulated pro-inflammatory markers (TNF\u03b1, NO, COX-2) and modulated antioxidant response (Nrf2) via TLR4/HO-I pathway. In longterm cultivation of human fibroblasts, CHNQ showed positive effect on mitochondria and lysosomes along with improvement of autophagy parameters [VEGA 2/0041/17, APVV-15-0308, APVV-18-0336].173.

However, H S can have a double biological action switching from neuromodulator to a neurotoxic agent when present at noxious levels. Furthermore, H S mediates the formation of cysteine persulfides (R-S-SH), which affect the activity of target proteins. The biological reactivity of the sulphur atom in cysteine is a significant factor in determining susceptibility to oxidative damage and neurodegeneration. It is thus important that H 2 S is maintained at physiological levels through a right balance between H S synthesis and breakdown. Our studies showed aberrant H 2 S levels in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). H 2 S, mainly produced by glial cells, is extremely toxic to motor neurons and increases Ca 2\u00fe intracellular concentration. In primary spinal cord cultures from ALS mouse model SOD1 G93A , H 2 S increases glialrelated toxicity, decreasing ATP production and mitochondrial respiration rate and promoting the activation of oxidative and nitrosativerelated pathways. Its modulation can reduce glial mediated pathology and ameliorate mitochondrial homeostasis. On these evidences, H 2 S is proposed as one of the toxic mediators released by glial cells that participates in the non-cell autonomous-mediated death observed in ALS.82.

According to [UQH \u2022 ] ss enhancement detected by EPR, H O 2 production rate was augmented (55%) in coupled mitochondria exposed to 1 \u03bcM NO.

                "text": "Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has increased by nearly 40% over the past 260 years, from pre-industrial levels of 285 parts per million (ppm) in 1750 (IPCC, 2013) to > 400 ppm in 2016 (https:// www.co2.earth/). The surface ocean has absorbed approximately onethird of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions (Sabine et al., 2004) , which has led to a shift in seawater chemistry by reducing the pH, carbonate ion concentration, and calcium carbonate saturation of seawater, so-called ocean acidification (OA) (Orr et al., 2005; Doney et al., 2009; Feely et al., 2009) . By the end of the 21st century, atmospheric CO 2 levels could reach approximately~1000 ppm (Friedlingstein et al., 2006) . OA directly affects marine calcifying organisms, such as planktonic coccolithophores, molluscs, echinoderms, and corals (Riebesell et al., 2000; Anthony et al., 2008; Appelhans et al., 2012) ; photosynthetic organisms, such as green algae, red algae, diatoms, cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates (Xia and Gao, 2005; Fu et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2010; Ihnken et al., 2011) ; and some marine fish (Munday et al., 2009) . In addition, OA likely affects the biogeochemical dynamics of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the ocean as well as the trace elements (Doney et al., 2009; Millero et al., 2009) . These effects can result in significant changes in the structure and function of marine ecosystems. Subsequently, these changes will exert both positive and negative feedback on atmospheric CO 2 levels.",

The changes in CO 3 2concentrations and aragonite or calcite saturation states due to OA will be faster in polar regions than in other regions. All Southern Ocean surface waters are projected to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite by 2100 (Orr et al., 2005; Mcclintock et al., 2009 ). Because OA is believed to have the largest impacts on the aragonite saturation in the Southern Ocean, it is essential to investigate the consequence of elevated CO 2 levels on marine organisms in the Antarctic regions. Recent predictions of the impact of OA in high latitude regions have primarily focused on calcifying organisms such as pteropods, mussels and oysters (Orr et al., 2005; Doney et al., 2009) ; however, the reports concentrating on sea ice microalgae are still few. Antarctic sea ice microalgae play a fundamental role in polar ecosystems, contributing approximately 5%-25% to the total annual primary production in ice-covered regions and providing an important food resource to grazers such as copepods, krill and salp (Lizotte, 2001) . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a better understanding of the effects of OA on the sea ice microalgae. Diatoms carry out > 40% of the global ocean primary productivity (Nelson et al., 1995; Roberts et al., 2007) , which also are the prominent components of the sea ice algal community in the Southern Ocean (Thomas and Dieckmann, 2002; Ryan et al., 2011) , Previous studies have examined the physiological responses of diatoms to OA. These conflicting findings indicate high species specificity regarding the impacts of OA on diatoms (Gao and Campbell, 2014) . Some researchers determined that diatoms, including some sea ice diatoms (Mitchell and Beardall, 1996; Tortell et al., 2008) , exhibit carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCM), which are regulated by inorganic carbon (Raven et al., 2011; Reinfelder, 2011) . However, the CCM of diatoms differ among diatom species and remain somewhat controversial (Burkhardt et al., 2001) , particularly the precise CCM in the sea ice diatom Nitzschia remain unclear.",

As the biological carbon pump, the responses to OA are associated with global carbon cycling. The links between the properties of the biological responses and organic carbon production are essential to fully comprehending the feedbacks associated with Antarctic marine organisms under OA to ocean carbon cycling. Under this scenario, we investigated the effects of OA on the physiological performance, inorganic nutrient uptake and carbon fixation of the Antarctic sea ice diatom Nitzschia sp. ICE-H. Here, we emphasized the particulate organic carbon production to predict the effects of OA on carbon cycling. Additionally, the CA activity in Nitzschia sp. ICE-H was also characterized to predict the CCM of this sea ice diatom. This study will ultimately help us to understand the responses of Antarctic organisms to future environments.",

Many Antarctic organisms, unicellular algae in particular, are susceptible to global changes (Somero, 2012) . However, there is currently little information on the effects of CO 2 on microalgae in extreme environments. Hence, we examined the effects of OA on the physiological performance of the Antarctic sea ice diatom, Nitzschia sp. ICE-H, which is linked with nutrient uptake and carbon fixation. Particular attention was paid to analysis of the effects on carbon sequestration and transformation under high CO 2 conditions. As we demonstrated here by partially renewing the culture medium, the biological activity did not perturb the carbonate chemistry of the media, and the changes in pH and DIC of the culture were minimal (Table 1) .

In this study, the cell concentrations and specific growth rates increased under high CO 2 conditions (1000 ppm) in comparison with cultures exposed to ambient (~400 ppm) CO 2 levels, which are characteristic responses of enhanced metabolic activity of this diatom species in response to increased CO . This capability of Nitzschia sp. ICE-H may indicate that this species is capable of successful future adaptation to OA if these organisms respond in a similar fashion in future long-term experiments. Similarly, several recent studies observed that the growth of some diatoms, such as Thalassiosira pseudonana, Skeletonema costatum, Navicula pelliculosa and other diatom species (Kim et al., 2006; Tortell et al., 2008; Low-D\u00e9carie et al., 2011; Mccarthy et al., 2012) , tended to increase under high CO 2 conditions (750-1000 ppm). Elevated CO can increase the N and P assimilation in cells, which was observed in our study. Enhanced N and P assimilation could be responsible for the observed increase in cellular particulate organic N and P. Moreover, the cellular chl a concentrations reported here were significantly enhanced by increasing CO , which may also explain the observed increase in algal growth.",

Additionally, the growth of some sea ice diatoms, such as Chaetoceros brevis, showed little or no change (Boelen et al., 2011) .

This study clearly demonstrated that elevated CO 2 supported the PSII activity of Nitzschia sp. ICE-H. The effective quantum yield (\u0424 PSII ) reflects the photosynthetic activity of algae. The values of \u0424 PSII in Nitzschia sp. ICE-H were in the range 0.55-0.59 ( Fig. 2a) , which were higher than the values (0.20-0.51) from sea ice algal community in Antarctica (McMinn et al., 2003) , indicated normal functioning, although both of them were lower than the maximal values from other aquatic plants (Kolber et al., 1988; Schreiber et al., 1995) . The \u0424 PSII was significantly increased by elevated CO 2 when integrated over 24 days, reflecting an increase in photosynthetic efficiency, which partly explains the mechanism of the positive effect of OA on growth. The \u0424 PSII is also used as an indicator of the influence of external stress on phytoplankton photosynthesis. The algae may decrease \u0424 PSII to maintain an effective photosynthetic reaction under environmental stress. The stress of salt, nutrient limitation and low light (Wang et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012) probably induced the depressed of the \u0424 PSII . The higher values of the \u0424 PSII under elevated CO 2 conditions implied a high level of acclimation to the high CO 2 . The photosynthetic parameters across CO concentrations might be associated with the cellular chl a concentrations, which were increased under high CO conditions. The main increased photosynthetic pigment would then be available for capturing more light energy for photosynthesis.",

                "text": "The cultures grown in high CO 2 conditions resulted in a decrease in CA activity, which indicated that CA was sensitive to CO and inhibited by elevated CO 2 . This finding is consistent with the report of Burkhardt et al. (2001) , who suggested that the CA activity in diatoms was inversely related to CO 2 concentration. However, the CA activity did not affect by the inorganic carbon utilization, which relied on more diffusive CO 2 entry. The presence of CA ex indicated that CA ex promoted CO 2 into the cell by accelerating HCO to CO 2 (Hopkinson et al., 2011; Ihnken et al., 2011) . The decline in CA ex activity under high CO 2 conditions suggested that the CA ex activity could be induced by the change in the environmental CO 2 concentration (Elzenga et al., 2000) . A possible reason for less CA ex being produced was that more available CO resulted in less HCO 3 needed for conversion to CO (Giordano et al., 2005; Matsuda et al., 2011) . This observation is consistent with the suggestions of various studies (Hofmann et al., 2013) . Previous studies have indicated that the CA ex activity in Phaeodactylum tricornutum was even close to the detection limit under high CO levels (Burkhardt et al., 2001) . The decrease in CA in activity under high CO 2 conditions suggested that CO 2 concentrations also regulate the CA in activity. The physiological function of CA is an important component of the CCM (Hopkinson et al., 2011; Hopkinson et al., 2016) . The CCM provide a steady-state CO 2 concentration at the active site of ribulose-1,5biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) by CA when inorganic carbon is limiting, which is energetically costly (Roberts et al., 2007; Raven et al., 2008; Spalding, 2008; Reinfelder, 2011) . The response of diatom growth and photosynthesis to changes in the CO 2 supply is determined by the mechanism of inorganic carbon uptake. In addition, an increased diatom growth rate under high CO 2 conditions could be attributed to the saving energy by the partial repression of CCM to some extent (Raven, 1991) . The major energy expended by the CCM in diatoms is the active transport of HCO 3 into the chloroplast (Hopkinson et al., 2011; Hopkinson et al., 2016) . Thus, high ambient CO in the medium could result in a reduction of the energetic cost of carbon fixation. Hence, OA saves energy through CCM down-regulation in marine diatoms due to increased CO entry. Accordingly, it indicated that the decrease in CA activity may be associated with the down-regulation of CCM. However, our results are insufficient to explain the CCM of sea ice diatom, it requires a comprehensive assessment of the CA activity, inhibitory effect of CA, half saturation constants for DICdependent O 2 evolution, CA gene expression and so on. Therefore, the role of CA and its association with the CCM in the sea ice Nitzschia needs to be further explored.",

ICE-H shifted more biogenic carbon flow from inorganic to organic forms under OA conditions. The increase in organic carbon also revealed the contribution to carbon acquisition of the photosynthetic carbon supply by OA. POC leads to carbon export to the deep ocean when it is associated with sinking diatom particles, and can be remineralized and returned the atmospheric carbon pool. In addition, some POC could be transformed into dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by bacteria; thereby, more POC contributes to more DOC production. Conversely, organic carbon production had the opposite effect on the CO 2 partial pressure in seawater. Enhanced POC production in Nitzschia reduced the CO 2 in the surrounding medium. Therefore, the increase in organic carbon production in sea ice diatoms due to the increase in CO 2 has the potential to significantly modify the carbon in the oceans. If the observed responses of Nitzschia sp. ICE-H to elevated CO 2 are a general phenomenon in most diatoms, the increase in POC production could significantly change the structure and functioning of sea ice ecosystems, in which diatoms play a dominant role.",

ICE-H under high CO conditions suggest that there is a greater possibility of blooms of this species with projected future trends of atmospheric CO enrichment. In the ocean environment, biogenic carbon fixed by diatoms is transformed through the food web. The pivotal organism in the Southern Ocean is krill, which feed largely on diatoms in winter, while bacteria are fueled by the dissolved organic matter produced by diatoms (Thomas and Dieckmann, 2002) . Therefore, the ocean's capacity to sequester carbon through the biological pump may be positively correlated to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Higher algal growth rates would not only enhance the vertical carbon flux but also increase the remineralization depth. The increasing output by the biological pump would ultimately affect the vertical distribution of inorganic nutrients in the ocean, transferring nutrients from the surface to the deep ocean. Overall, OA can influence biological carbon recycling in the Southern Ocean and regulate the air-sea CO 2 flux. All these processes, in turn, may create potential climate feedbacks.",

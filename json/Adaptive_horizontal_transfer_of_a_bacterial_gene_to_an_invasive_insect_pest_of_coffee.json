Although often detected in prokaryotes, examples of HGT involving animals are relatively rare, and any evolutionary advantage conferred to the recipient is typically obscure. We identified a gene (HhMAN1) from the coffee berry borer beetle, Hypothenemus hampei, a devastating pest of coffee, which shows clear evidence of HGT from bacteria. HhMAN1 encodes a mannanase, representing a class of glycosyl hydrolases that has not previously been reported in insects. Recombinant HhMAN1 protein hydrolyzes coffee berry galactomannan, the major storage polysaccharide in this species and the presumed food of H. hampei. HhMAN1 was found to be widespread in a broad biogeographic survey of H. hampei accessions, indicating that the HGT event occurred before radiation of the insect from West Africa to Asia and South America. However, the gene was not detected in the closely related species H. obscurus (the tropical nut borer or \"false berry borer\"), which does not colonize coffee beans. Thus, HGT of HhMAN1 from bacteria represents a likely adaptation to a specific ecological niche and may have been promoted by intensive agricultural practices.",

In contrast, other than ancient massive HGT associated with the acquisition of endosymbiotic organelles, there are far fewer reported examples of HGT involving eukaryotes, either between eukaryotic species or from prokaryote to eukaryote (3) . Examples of HGT involving animals are even rarer, presumably because the germline is isolated from the somatic cells, and so is less likely to come into contact with foreign DNA (4). Indeed, most of the documented cases have been limited to invertebrates as the recipient and involve endosymbionts, where the association between the bacteria and host cells is particularly intimate and can occur in germ cells (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, there are reported examples of HGT where the gene donor is not an endosymbiont (3) , such as the transfer of genes allowing the synthesis of carotenoids from fungi to aphids (9) and the spider mite Tetranychus urticae (10) , and large scale transfer of genes to bdelloid rotifers that appear to be derived from bacteria, fungi, and plants (11) . Additionally, some cases of close symbiotic associations, such as that seen in coral, do not show evidence of HGT (12) , underling its rarity.",

Moreover, there has been considerable controversy regarding the lack of functional validation of genes that are putatively assigned as being present following HGT, and the underlying evolutionary pressures and biological significance of such genes has often been unclear (14) . In prokaryotes, HGT has repeatedly been associated with adaptation to new environments (2) , and this trend is also beginning to emerge in eukaryotes. For example, the adoption of a plant-parasite lifestyle in several genera of nematodes was enabled by multiple HGT events (15) , and a similar case of HGT facilitating plant parasitism was suggested by genome-scale analyses of oomycetes of the genus Phytophthora, which revealed that a substantial portion of the secreted proteomes was a consequence of HGT from fungi (16) .",

This beetle is a specific pest of coffee (Coffea spp.) and is a major threat to coffee production worldwide, causing losses estimated at >500 million US dollars per year and affecting >20 million rural farming families (17) . We describe the identification of a mannanase gene in the H. hampei genome that is likely to have originated in gut bacteria, as well as features of the associated genomic region that suggest a potential mechanism of gene transfer to the insect. There is a growing awareness that the metabolism of bacterial symbionts can confer important evolutionary advantages to insects (18) , whether as endo-or ectosymbionts. This current study further suggests that intestinal bacteria may also provide a source of genetic material that allows rapid adaptations to new ecological niches, in this case, in the context of intensive agricultural production.",

The coffee berry borer (Fig. 1A) reproduces and feeds exclusively inside coffee berries ( Fig. 1B) , which are primarily composed of carbohydrates (60%), proteins (10%), lipids (12%), organic acids, and caffeine (1%) (19) . The feeding habits of H. hampei larvae suggest that they possess a hydrolytic system that is capable of enzymatically digesting the polysaccharides of coffee seeds (commonly referred to as coffee beans), which, in turn, are absorbed by the insect midgut during feeding. However, this process is poorly understood. To identify proteins that are secreted into the H. hampei midgut that may be involved in coffee berry infestation and digestion, we conducted a secretome functional screen using a yeast-secretion trap (20) with cDNA derived from H. hampei midgut. Among the cDNAs recovered, we identified one (HhMAN1) that is predicted to encode a secreted protein with homology to mannanase enzymes of glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes Database; www.cazy.org). This gene was selected for further characterization not only because galactomannan is the major storage polysaccharide of coffee beans (21) but also because there was no precedent for an insect mannanase in sequence databases.",

To confirm that H. hampei is capable of hydrolyzing the storage polysaccharide galactomannan, we prepared crude enzyme extracts from the midguts of adult H. hampei and assayed for activity toward galactomannan isolated from coffee berries. For comparison, extracts were similarly prepared from the midguts of H. obscurus and A. fasciculatus adults. Whereas H. hampei extracts showed galactomannan hydrolysis activity that was nearly linear with time, galactomannan hydrolysis activities were essentially absent from the H. obscurus and A. fasciculatus extracts (Fig. 4A) . The lack of mannanase activity in these two species provides important support for the PCR results indicating that HhMAN1 is only present in H. hampei (Fig. 2C) , given that the PCR primers used may not have been appropriate for amplifying more divergent mannanase gene sequences, and suggests the absence of mannanases in H. obscurus and A. fasciculatus. These results indicate that the acquisition of HhMAN1 by H. hampei may have been a prerequisite for specialization on its only host: coffee beans.",

                "text": "Although HGT in prokaryotes has long been established as a central mechanism of evolutionary adaptation, its significance in animals is often debated, and there are relatively few examples. Furthermore, whereas the mechanisms of HGT in prokaryotes are well known (2, 27) , the mechanisms of eukaryotic HGT remain elusive, and the functional significance of HGT is rarely evident. Here, we report that HhMAN1, which encodes a secreted mannanase that is active against the primary seed storage polysaccharide of coffee, is the result of HGT between bacteria and an insect. This transfer likely confers an adaptive advantage because H. hampei uses the coffee berry as a specific host. Phylogenetic analysis of HhMAN1 clearly indicates that the sequence is more closely related to eubacterial than eukaryotic genes, and, previously, there have been no mannanase sequences identified in insects. Because symbiotic microorganisms can be the source of polysaccharide hydrolytic activity required for plant biomass degradation (28) , it was important to exclude the possibility of HhMAN1 actually being encoded by the midgut microbiota of H. hampei. PCR amplification of genomic DNA derived from multiple organs and developmental stages of H. hampei established that the sequence was ubiquitously present and, thus, not a contaminant of midgut-derived material. The HhMAN1 cDNA and genomic region revealed that HhMAN1 has adopted several features indicative of a eukaryotic context, perhaps the most intriguing of which is that the HhMAN1 gene is flanked by two eukaryotic transposons of the hAT and Tc1/ mariner superfamilies. Not only does this provide further evidence that HhMAN1 occurs in the genome of H. hampei and not that of a symbiotic microbe, but it also suggests a potential mechanism for HGT in animals. Genome recombination, mobilization, and reorganization are associated with transposable elements and HGT of the mariner transposon between several eukaryotic species has been reported previously (29) , although, in this case, there was no observation of HGT of neighboring nontransposon genes. Such an association is suggested by our results, as well as a study of bdelloid rotifers that identified extensive examples of HGT in telomeric regions rich in retrotransposons and DNA transposons, including those of the hAT and Tc1/mariner superfamilies (11) . We propose that transposonmediated incorporation of foreign DNA could be one component of the poorly understood mechanism of HGT involving animals.",

                "text": "Ultraviolet radiation (UVR; 400-100 nm) is the most energetic region of the broad spectrum of wavelengths that reach the Earth from solar radiation. This radiation is further subdivided into ultraviolet (UV)-A (400-315 nm), UV-B (315-280 nm) and UV-C (280-100 nm) [1, 2] . Almost all the UV-C and a large fraction of the UV-B radiation are absorbed by the ozone layer in the stratosphere. This results in 5% UV-B and 95% UV-A accounting for the total UVR that reaches the Earth's surface. These energy components impact on the Earth's biosphere [3, 4] . Previous physiological response studies in humans revealed that there are vital benefits to UVR exposure-the production of vitamin D, which is essential for prevention of osteoporosis and skeletal disease [5] [6] [7] , and improving symptoms of mental health conditions such as seasonal affective disorder and schizophrenia [8, 9] . However, the damaging effects of overexposure to UVR have been widely reported in previous studies and reviews-these include cataract formation, skin ageing, DNA mutation, and skin cancer [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Hence, the need for a balance between exposure to UVR and protection against overexposure to UV-A and UV-B is of crucial importance.",

Despite being less energetic, UV-A is very abundant at the Earth's surface and penetrates much deeper into the skin than UV-B radiation, reaching far into the dermis [32, 33] . The effects of UV-A radiation on humans have been reported as ranging from suppression of acquired immunity, DNA mutation and the production of reactive oxygen species which often facilitate skin ageing and carcinogenesis [34, 35] . Since the effects of UV-A radiation on the skin have been reported, the sunscreen industry and regulatory agencies now desire a broadband sunscreen (i.e., sunscreens that span across both UV-B and UV-A). However, there are still only a few Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/European Union (EU)-approved UV-A filters and the most widely used (avobenzone) is not very photostable [34] [35] [36] [37] . This implies that research is still required for the identification of effective UV-A filters.",

A similar report on oxybenzone and other sunscreen active ingredients was published in an opinion paper by the European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety based on reviews of 20 publications on the dermatological effects of sunscreen agents [44] . Following the research reported by Heurung et al. [45] , the American Contact Dermatitis Society in 2014 listed benzophenones as the allergen of the year, with oxybenzone showing the worst allergenic effects of the class. Matta et al. [46, 47] studied the absorption and pharmacokinetics of commonly used organic UV filters in sunscreen formulations, such as avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, ecamsule, homosalate, octisalate and octinoxate, and these UV filters were reported to have achieved plasma concentrations significantly above the FDA threshold. Altogether, these allergen studies do not provide any evidence that organic UV filters are harmful. However, it raises some questions about their safety. Considering these drawbacks, research has been targeted towards designing photostable and safe UV filters for both humans and the environment. One way to achieve this is by using nature as inspiration for UV filter design.",

Plants require sunlight for photosynthesis, hence the need for some UVR exposure; however, too much UVR can result in damaging effects [48] . Like humans, moderate exposure of plants to UVR has important implications; UV-B radiation in particular acts as a signal transducer for a vast array of processes that initiate or regulate gene responses in plants that are essential for survival [49] . Furthermore, UV-B radiation has been reported to stimulate the expression of genes responsible for UV protection and DNA repair, and therefore actively promotes survival in sunlight [49, 50] . However, overexposure to UVR can result in a number of damaging effects, such as inhibition of growth, disruption of transpiration and photosynthesis. Other effects include damage of DNA, either by direct photodamage or indirectly through the generation of reactive oxygen species, which can, in turn, interact with DNA nucleotides [49] [50] [51] . Other reported damages include a reduction in the pollen fertility of some plants and photomorphogenesis of plant leaves, e.g., thickening of epidermis which increase susceptibility to invading pathogens [49, 50] . On the other hand, underexposure to UVR (UV-B) could result in susceptibility of the plant to pathogens and a reduction in the UV-B signal transduction pathway that supports many photophysical processes supra [49, 50] .",

The phenylpropanoid pathway is responsible for the synthesis of several metabolites used in numerous biochemical processes in plants. With respect to photoprotection, previous studies have shown that certain phenolic substances deposited in the vacuoles of cells in the upper epidermis of leaves, such as sinapoyl malate (SM) and the building block, sinapic acid (SA) (see Figure 1a ), are the most prominent metabolites [12, 53] . These molecules (SM and SA) act as UV-B filters by absorbing UVR and subsequently dissipating the UV energy (as heat) before it reaches sensitive cells in the leaves. For example, in thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), SM has been reported as the UV filter that reduces the potential adverse effect of excess UV-B radiation [12, 52] . While early works on plant UV filters and their derivatives have been reviewed in detail in previous publications [54, 55] , the photochemistry and photophysics of the recently reported literature for these classes of UV filters will be covered in Section 2.1 of this review. filters and their derivatives have been reviewed in detail in previous publications [54, 55] , the photochemistry and photophysics of the recently reported literature for these classes of UV filters will be covered in Section 2.1 of this review.

Structurally, mycosporines are composed of a cyclohexenone unit with different amino compounds bound at carbon three (relative to the carbonyl), represented as R in Figure 1b . Mycosporine-like amino acids are composed of a cyclohexenimine unit with an imino moiety at carbon one and an amino compound at carbon three, represented as R1 and R2, respectively, in Figure 1b [60] . Fungi only synthesize mycosporines, while marine microorganisms can synthesize both mycosporines and mycosporine-like amino acids [58] .

There are more than 30 known MAAs to date [63] , each with an absorption maximum in the UV-A or UV-B region (310-362 nm) and molar extinction coefficients in the range of 28,100 to 50,000 M \u22121 cm \u22121 [67, 68] , cf. 34 140 M \u22121 cm \u22121 for avobenzone [69] .

There are more than 30 known MAAs to date [63] , each with an absorption maximum in the UV-A or UV-B region (310-362 nm) and molar extinction coefficients in the range of 28,100 to [67, 68] , cf. 34 140 M \u22121 cm \u22121 for avobenzone [69] . As a result, MAAs are considered to be the strongest UV-A absorbers found in nature. In addition to their strong UV absorption, some MAAs, such as mycosporine-glycine, exhibit antioxidant properties that make them highly desirable to the commercial industry [61, 62, 70, 71] . A recent publication by Rosic [68] reviewed some of the aforementioned roles of MAAs, and linked them to how MAAs could be used in the commercial industry to overcome some of the drawbacks with current UV filters covered in Section 1.1.2. It is noted here that several publications have identified the instability of some MAAs, in particular those with a cyclohexenone core, as they undergo hydrolysis of the amine on carbon three [72] [73] [74] . Whilst this is not the focus of the present review, it is an important factor that must be considered when determining a good UV filter, and is an avenue that certainly warrants future work.",

In addition to these studies, complementary theoretical work has modelled the minimum energy relaxation pathways of MAAs and molecules alike, giving insight into their photoprotective mechanisms [84, [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] . Section 2.2 of this review will primarily cover ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical work conducted to the present date on MAAs and MAA motifs.

These include the use of absorption, emission, scattering and ion spectroscopy to examine reaction coordinates. Compared to the time required for bond breaking and formation (picoseconds or less), these preliminary approaches could only record data on a longer timescale, thereby providing evidence about the initial and final processes occurring along the reaction coordinate without direct time resolution [91, 92] . Improving on these approaches, Zewail and co-workers employed femtosecond time-resolution experiments to monitor the transition state of a photochemical reaction directly, using the ultrafast pump-probe technique. In this technique, the laser pump pulse is used to excite the molecule of interest to the excited state, from where relaxation back to the ground state can occur on the timescale of femtoseconds or picoseconds. After the pump pulse excites the sample of interest, a second probe laser pulse is used to track the excited-state population at various delay times relative to the initial pump pulse excitation [92] . This concept of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy is the basis for transient electronic absorption spectroscopy (TEAS), a technique used in understanding the photochemistry of UV filters in solution and discussed herein.",

The resultant triplet state/photoproduct will absorb at different probe wavelengths to the original molecule of interest, and this results in a reduced intensity of light reaching the detector at this particular wavelength for the excited analyte compared to the non-excited analyte. On substitution into Equation 1, a positive \u2206OD is produced. Each of these processes contributes towards the overall transient absorption spectra (TAS) that will be presented throughout Section of this review.",

Finally, \u03c4 3 was assigned to isomerisation along the 2 1 \u03c0\u03c0* state to generate either the cis or trans isomers in their respective S 0 through a 2 1 \u03c0\u03c0*/S 0 CI. A summary of the relaxation dynamics is described in the scheme shown in Figure [104] . An alternative relaxation mechanism was proposed without recourse to the 2 \u03c0\u03c0* intermediary state. In this case, the authors suggest that \u03c4 1 and \u03c4 2 correspond to the excited-state population relaxing along the S 1 potential energy surface (PES) before relaxing back to S 0 via 1 1 \u03c0\u03c0*/S 0 CI on the \u03c4 3 timescale. To summarize, the results of the study by Baker et al. [104] showed a favourable, ultrafast relaxation mechanism for SM and SA following excitation. This highlights the ability of these systems to efficiently dissipate the absorbed UV energy and bypass potentially deleterious processes (triplet state, radicals, etc.), which is a positive attribute for a UV filter in sunscreen formulation. The authors proposed that following photoexcitation to the first singlet excited state (1 \u03c0\u03c0*), SM and SA undergo multiple processes that are convoluted together and defined by \u03c41 and \u03c42 presented in Table 1 , thereby making the distinct assignment of any one process with these lifetimes difficult. Nonetheless, Baker et al. [104] proposed that \u03c41 defines the evolution out of the Franck-Condon window and \u03c42 was suggested to have resulted from the solvent rearrangement and internal conversion via a 1 \u03c0\u03c0*/2 1 \u03c0\u03c0* conical intersection (CI). Finally, \u03c43 was assigned to isomerisation along the 2 1 \u03c0\u03c0* state to generate either the cis or trans isomers in their respective S0 through a 2 1 \u03c0\u03c0*/S0 CI. A summary of the relaxation dynamics is described in the scheme shown in Figure 4 [104] . An alternative relaxation mechanism was proposed without recourse to the 2 \u03c0\u03c0* intermediary state. In this case, the authors suggest that \u03c41 and \u03c42 correspond to the excited-state population relaxing along the S1 potential energy surface (PES) before relaxing back to S0 via 1 1 \u03c0\u03c0*/S0 CI on the \u03c43 timescale.",

This highlights the ability of these systems to efficiently dissipate the absorbed UV energy and bypass potentially deleterious processes (triplet state, radicals, etc.), which is a positive attribute for a UV filter in sunscreen formulation. Baker et al.'s work suggests that SM and SA undergo similar photodynamics following photoexcitation [104] . However, no dynamical behaviour suggests the choice of SM (e.g., in thale cress) as the plant UV filter over SA. In an attempt to justify nature's choice of SM and not SA as the UV filter in plants, Luo et al. [106] studied the ionic forms of SM and SA (SM 2\u2212 and SA \u2212 ), as they occur under physiological pH conditions in plant leaves, using a combination of TEAS and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The results of their study revealed that SM 2\u2212 , SA \u2212 and SA undergo a non-radiative decay via a barrierless trans-cis photoisomerisation relaxation pathway leading to the formation of cis photoproducts. This compares well with the proposed relaxation mechanism for SM and SA by Baker et al. [104] even when pH is taken into account. Nevertheless, Luo et al. [106] reported that following continuous irradiation (i.e., static irradiation of the sample with continuous-wave beam), the photoisomerisation of the trans-SM 2\u2212 isomer (and trans-SA) yields the cis isomer with absorption spectrum characteristics similar in intensities and shape to the trans isomer spectrum, as shown in Figure 5a ,c. As evident in Figure 5b , the photoisomerisation of trans-SAresults in a cis absorption spectrum that is significantly blue shifted and decreased in intensity following irradiation, suggesting a change in spectral characteristics. Luo et al. [106] concluded that Baker et al.'s work suggests that SM and SA undergo similar photodynamics following photoexcitation [104] .

The authors concluded that photoisomerisation of SM is likely facilitated by the out-of-plane rotation about the C=C bond (i.e., a large-amplitude vibrational motion) and consequently is the reason for the large solvent viscosity effect on its photodynamics [107] . The aforementioned studies not only provide insight into understanding the photodynamics of SM and SA, but they also provide information about the solvent environments (pH and viscosity) and the justification of plant selection of SM over SA for photoprotection. Furthermore, the ultrafast excited-state lifetime and the photoisomerisation relaxation mechanism suggest that an appropriate chemical modification of SM and SA could make a good UV filter for use in sunscreen formulations provided it has no adverse effects on the skin and ecosystem.",

TEAS and TD-DFT studies have been reported for methyl sinapate (MS), isopropyl sinapate (IS), sinapoyl methyl lactate (SML) and sinapoyl dimethyl malate (SDM) in various solvents and poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel film [104, 109, 110] . The results of these studies have been reviewed in more detail in previous publications [54, 55] . Briefly, the results of the study carried out on MS, IS, SML and SDM in buffer solution (0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.1 M Na2HPO4, pH = 6.8) by Liu et al. [109] revealed that these sinapate esters undergo relaxation dynamics along the trans-cis isomerisation coordinate, as seen in SM and SA [104, 106] . A further study by Horbury et al. [107] has investigated SM more closely to explore the influence of solvent viscosity on the proposed photodynamics [107] . A comprehensive review of this study has been reported in a previous publication [108] . Briefly, following TEAS measurements, the study revealed that the time constant assigned to the relaxation of the excited-state population along the trans-cis photoisomerisation coordinate (viz. \u03c4 2 in SM and SA, supra) increases considerably with increasing viscosity, from 47 ps in ethanol to 560 ps in glycerol.

TEAS and TD-DFT studies have been reported for methyl sinapate (MS), isopropyl sinapate (IS), sinapoyl methyl lactate (SML) and sinapoyl dimethyl malate (SDM) in various solvents and poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel film [104, 109, 110] . The results of these studies have been reviewed in more detail in previous publications [54, 55] . Briefly, the results of the study carried out on MS, IS, SML and SDM in buffer solution (0.1 M NaH 2 PO 4 , 0.1 M Na 2 HPO 4 , pH = 6.8) by Liu et al. [109] revealed that these sinapate esters undergo relaxation dynamics along the trans-cis isomerisation coordinate, as seen in SM and SA [104, 106] . Additionally, the extracted time constant from the fit of the data had non-linear dependence on the size of the sinapate ester (in size order MS < IS < SML < SDM). Liu et al. [109] then took an additional step towards mimicking the effect of applying a sunscreen to the surface of a skin by including the sinapate esters within a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel film. The authors justified the inclusion of PVA as a skin model due to its complex hydrogen bonding network [109] . The authors observed a 25-fold increase in the time taken for isomerisation of the sinapate esters to occur in PVA following photoexcitation compare to the values observed in buffer solution. The increased time constant for isomerisation in PVA is evidence of the restriction of motion in the film environment. This work presents the need to study plant-based UV filters in a close-to-real environment.",

[111] , the effect of para substituents on the excited-state photodynamics of MS (the transform) including para methoxy methyl sinapate (p-OMeMS) and para hydrogen methyl sinapate (p-HMS) shown in Figure 6 were investigated. Briefly, the findings revealed that p-OMeMS and MS undergo similar dynamics along the trans-cis photoisomerisation coordinate, as seen in previous studies [104, 109, 110] . p-HMS, on the other hand, undergoes different dynamics with an internal conversion from the initial optically bright excited state (denoted V(\u03c0\u03c0*)) to a relative dark state (denoted V'(\u03c0\u03c0*)), which results into branching of the excited-state relaxation. While the V(\u03c0\u03c0*) still relaxes non-radiatively, as seen in MS and p-OMeMS, the V'(\u03c0\u03c0*) decays to the ground state via fluorescence (i.e., emission of a photon) in 5 ns [111] . The radiative decay reported for the relaxation mechanism of p-HMS in the excited state is undesirable of a UV filter; it could result in the formation of harmful photoproducts (including radicals), which implies that it is not a good candidate for inclusion in a sunscreen [54] . On the other hand, the favourable energy dissipation mechanism of p-OMeMS and MS suggests the contrary for these two systems. However, the potential genotoxicity concerns surrounding the cis isomer (photoproduct), as reported for related cinnamates [112] , need to be further explored. This study distinguishes the difference between the dynamics mediated via the V(\u03c0\u03c0*) and V'(\u03c0\u03c0*) states and revealed the importance of substituents in the molecular design of plant-based UV filters.

The TAS of both isomers shown in Figure 7a ,b are dominated by two features, an ESA centred at~425 nm and a GSB centred at 335 nm. From their data, Horbury et al. [114] establish that at pump-probe delay times (\u2206t) > 20 ps, the ESA in the TAS has decayed to zero \u2206OD (where \u2206OD denotes the change in optical density). However, at longer \u2206t, the TAS of both isomers revealed a pair of spectral features in the probe region of 330-350 nm assigned to GSB and photoproduct absorption. The authors determined from the TAS at \u2206t = 2 ns, shown in Figure 7c ,d, that this pair of features differ between the two isomers.

The similarities between the TAS and \u2206UV/visible spectrum (see Figure 7c ,d) for photoexcited trans-ES led the authors to propose that the cis isomer is being formed, while the TAS and \u2206UV/visible spectrum for initially photoexcited cis-ES revealed that the trans isomer is formed.

It was reported that the excited-state dynamics of both isomers could be fitted with three time constants shown in Table 2 . The extracted time constants \u03c4ivr and \u03c4iso for trans-ES were assigned to intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) and photoisomerisation along the trans to cis isomerisation coordinate, respectively. The authors reported that following this (isomerisation) coordinate, the formation of cis-ES as a photoproduct and the initially photoexcited trans-ES were observed, both in their electronic ground state, with the lifetime \u03c4pp. Their evidence for these assignments was based on the dynamics of the trans isomers of other sinapates, previously discussed in the literature [104, 110] . Seeing the similarities between the TAS and extracted time constants between cis-ES and trans-ES, the authors proposed that cis-ES undergoes the same photodynamics as trans-ES, with the photoisomerisation being cis to trans instead and \u03c4pp denoting the lifetime of trans-ES as the photoproduct and initially photoexcited cis-ES in their electronic ground state. However, from their results, the authors observed that photoisomerisation of trans-ES occurs 10% faster compared to cis-ES, and there is more recovery of the cis-ES GSB than the GSB of trans-ES, Following qualitative analysis of the data, the quantitative insight into the dynamical process of the TAS was obtained by sequential (A",

It was reported that the excited-state dynamics of both isomers could be fitted with three time constants shown in Table 2 . The extracted time constants \u03c4 ivr and \u03c4 iso for trans-ES were assigned to intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) and photoisomerisation along the trans to cis isomerisation coordinate, respectively. The authors reported that following this (isomerisation) coordinate, the formation of cis-ES as a photoproduct and the initially photoexcited trans-ES were observed, both in their electronic ground state, with the lifetime \u03c4 pp . Their evidence for these assignments was based on the dynamics of the trans isomers of other sinapates, previously discussed in the literature [104, 110] . Seeing the similarities between the TAS and extracted time constants between cis-ES and trans-ES, the authors proposed that cis-ES undergoes the same photodynamics as trans-ES, with the photoisomerisation being cis to trans instead and \u03c4 pp denoting the lifetime of trans-ES as the photoproduct and initially photoexcited cis-ES in their electronic ground state. However, from their results, the authors observed that photoisomerisation of trans-ES occurs 10% faster compared to cis-ES, and there is more recovery of the cis-ES GSB than the GSB of trans-ES, thereby suggesting that the isomerisation is biased towards the cis-isomer. This claim is further supported from the extracted ratio of cisto trans-ES following steady-state irradiation, which showed a 70:30 ratio of cis to trans isomer irrespective of the starting isomer. The authors concluded that the resultant ratio is kinetically rather than thermodynamically driven. Overall, it was determined that the photochemistry of the cis isomer is very likely comparable to the photochemistry of the naturally synthesized trans isomer, in terms of dissipating the dangerous excess energy imparted due to potentially phototoxic UV absorption. Further, the efficient ultrafast energy dissipation mechanism along the trans-cis isomerisation coordinate resulting in the repopulation of the ground state implies that there is less chance for toxic relaxation pathways (triplet state, radicals, etc.).

This then facilitates the non-adiabatic relaxation to the ground state, generating either the original trans-MS or a cis-MS photoproduct. Contrary to trans-MS, the relaxation pathway of the cis-MS includes decay of the excited cis-MS on a sub-picosecond timescale, followed by the decay of the trans-MS formed adiabatically from the excited cis-MS [113] . Consequently, the authors conclude that the isomerisation barrier of the cis-MS* stems from the isomerisation barrier for the allylic C=C double bond twisting of trans-MS*. Combining these results, Zhao et al. [113] claim that the relaxation mechanism of cis-MS includes an adiabatic relaxation pathway competing with a non-adiabatic relaxation pathway. A summary of the relaxation dynamics is shown in Figure 8b . This work revealed the difference between the photodynamics of cisand trans-MS.",

This then facilitates the non-adiabatic relaxation to the ground state, generating either the original trans-MS or a cis-MS photoproduct. Contrary to trans-MS, the relaxation pathway of the cis-MS includes decay of the excited cis-MS on a sub-picosecond timescale, followed by the decay of the trans-MS formed adiabatically from the excited cis-MS [113] . Consequently, the authors conclude that the isomerisation barrier of the cis-MS* stems from the isomerisation barrier for the allylic C=C double bond twisting of trans-MS*. Combining these results, Zhao et al. [113] claim that the relaxation mechanism of cis-MS includes an adiabatic relaxation pathway competing with a non-adiabatic relaxation pathway. A summary of the relaxation dynamics is shown in Figure 8b . This work revealed the difference between the photodynamics of cis-and trans-MS.",

In addition to the TEAS measurements, steady-state UV/visible, endocrine disruption, and antioxidant properties of DES are reported in their study. The results of this study are discussed herein. In their steady-state UV/visible spectra shown in Figure 9b , Horbury et al. [115] observed a redshifted spectrum compared to the monoester (ES), the cause of which was assigned to the additional \u03c0-system conjugation in DES. Furthermore, the authors observed improved photostability, with a 3.3% reduction in absorption for DES following 2 h of irradiation (see Figure 9b ), compared to 16% previously reported for ES after 45 min of irradiation [114] . The cause of this improved photostability In their steady-state UV/visible spectra shown in Figure 9b , Horbury et al. [115] observed a red-shifted spectrum compared to the monoester (ES), the cause of which was assigned to the additional \u03c0-system conjugation in DES. Furthermore, the authors observed improved photostability, with a 3.3% reduction in absorption for DES following 2 h of irradiation (see Figure 9b ), compared to 16% previously reported for ES after 45 min of irradiation [114] . The cause of this improved photostability was attributed to needless photoequilibrium between the trans and cis isomers of DES following photoexcitation [115] . The TAS of DES in alkyl benzoate after being applied to the surface of VC (termed DES VC/AB) shown as a false colour map by the authors is presented in Figure 9c . For comparison, additional TAS of DES were also collected in C12-15 alkyl benzoate only (termed DES/AB), ethanol and cyclohexane to provide a range of solvent environments. However, these are not reproduced here. Similar to what has been seen in ES [114] , the TAS of DES VC/AB consists of a single ESA which quickly decays within a time delay (\u2206t) of <100 fs as the excited-state population evolves out of the Franck-Condon region. In ES, this feature was assigned to geometry relaxation, the authors suggest that DES undergoes a similar mechanism. Following the geometry relaxation, the three notable spectral features that ensues in the TAS reported by Horbury et al. [115] are a GSB at~350 nm, a strong ESA at~380 nm and a second weaker ESA at~540 nm, all of which are in accordance with what has been observed in the literature for ES [114] . At \u2206t = ps, the ESA observed in the TAS at a probe wavelength of~540 nm has decayed to zero \u2206OD while a remnant of the GSB and ESA at~380 nm remains. In previous studies, these have been attributed to a phenoxy radical or isomer formation. However, the authors ruled out isomer and radical formation due to the identical cis and trans isomer and decay of the feature over time.",

This paper reports the kinetics in terms of rate constants compared to its inverse of time constants used to describe the kinetics for other systems reviewed herein. It was found that all datasets, DES VC/AB, DES/AB, and DES in ethanol, could be fitted with five kinetic rate constants (k -k 5 ) except for DES in cyclohexane which returned three rate constants. These rate constants are shown in Table 3 . The authors assigned the dynamics of k 1 -k 3 based on previously reported literature for ES [114] and other sinapate esters [104, 114] . The rate constant k 1 represents geometry relaxation out of the Franck-Condon region, k 2 defines evolution along the excited state including vibrational cooling and solvent rearrangement and k 3 describes the rate constant for photoisomerisation and repopulation of the electronic ground state. However, the authors highlighted that since DES is symmetrical, it is impossible to determine whether the photoisomerisation occurs completely or is an aborted photoisomerisation. Additional k 4 observed for DES was assigned to a 1 n\u03c0* state which has been identified to play a role in cinnamate photodynamics. Finally, k 5 defines a long-lived GSB resulting from either a molecular photoproduct or a trapped excited-state population [115] . Table 3 . Summary of the rate constants (k n ) resulting from sequential global fit of the TAS of DES in VC/AB, AB, ethanol and cyclohexene.

Even though the authors observed similar photochemistry for DES in all the solvents, the differences associated with the rate constants were highlighted, with a focus on comparison between DES VC/AB and DES/AB. This was done to see whether the more realistic \"skin environment\" had any effect on the dynamics of DES. Briefly, the authors observed an almost three-fold increase in k 4 for DES/AB compared to DES VC/AB. This difference was attributed to a potential greater barrier experienced by population trapped in the excited state towards ground-state recovery in DES VC/AB.",

Although consistent photodynamics were observed between DES in an emollient used in commercial sunscreen formulation, and when deposited on VC, the mild dependence of DES photodynamics on its environment highlights the need to study potential UV filters in a closer-to-real-life setting.",

All four mycosporine motifs are composed of the same cyclohexenone core structure, with varying substituents on carbons two and three. In the work by Losantos et al. [89] , CASPT2//CASSCF methodology [119, 120] was used on molecules 1-3 to compute the absorption spectrum, the critical points along the PES and the minimum energy paths (MEPs) connecting them [89] . Similar critical points along all three molecules' PES were determined. As a result, only molecule 1 was explored in more detail by the authors to elucidate the photoprotection mechanism; Figure 11 presents the MEP for molecule 1 [89] . In brief, photoexcitation leads to populating the S2 excited state via a 1 \u03c0\u03c0* transition. An out-of-plane geometry distortion of the substituents at carbons one, two and three results in access to the S2/S1 CI; see Figure 10 for atom numbers. Relaxation along the S1 PES finds a minimum on the S1 coordinate with planar geometry. A higher energy S1/S0 CI was located with the same out-of-plane geometry distortion as was found at the S2/S1 CI. Losantos et al. [89] concluded that after photoexcitation, molecule 1 would become trapped in the S1 minimum and suggested that electronic ground-state recovery would occur via radiative decay. Such a decay mechanism is undesirable of a UV filter, because the emitted photon could be damaging to skin cells [54] . As such, its inclusion in a sunscreen formulation is not ideal.

The absorption maxima of the two species is red shifted~30 nm for gadusolate and corresponds to a \u03c0\u03c0* transition [82, 87, 124] . Arbeloa et al. [82] conducted several experimental studies on gadusol and gadusolate to determine the photostability and deactivation pathways of these species. The photodecomposition quantum yields were determined as 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 for gadusol and gadusolate, respectively, in aqueous solutions. The authors conclude that although both species demonstrate good photostability, it is apparent that gadusolate dissipates its absorbed energy quicker than gadusol, reducing the probability of competing reactive relaxation pathways. Additionally, no fluorescence was observed for either gadusol or gadusolate, providing evidence for non-radiative decay upon photoexcitation in both species [82] .",

The experimental setup and detailed explanations on photoacoustic calorimetry can be found in the following reviews: Braslavsky and Heibel [125] , Arnaut et al. [126] and, Gensch and Viappiani [127] . For a base understanding, it is important to highlight that in a photoacoustic calorimetry experiment, a calorimetric standard is used that does not undergo any radiative decay pathways and absorbs at a similar wavelength to the solute [128] . In the case of gadusolate, the ratio of photoacoustic signal amplitude between gadusolate and the calorimetric standard was equivalent within the experimental error, indicating that gadusolate dissipates its absorbed energy as heat within the first tens of nanoseconds [82] . The above findings indicate that repopulation of the ground state via non-radiative decay mechanisms occurs for both gadusol and gadusolate, which in turn provides some evidence for nature's choice to use mycosporines as effective UV filters.",

The critical points along each MEP are displayed in Figure 12 to illustrate the proposed mechanisms for each species by Losantos et al. [87] Upon photoexcitation, it was found that gadusol is promoted to the optically bright S excited state, via a 1 \u03c0\u03c0* transition. At the S /S 1 CI, an out-of-plane movement of the oxygen atoms of the C=O and OH moieties within the chromophore is present along with elongation of the C=C and C=O bonds. Additionally, compared to the S 0 minimum geometry, which is substantially planar, the geometry at the S 2 /S 1 CI is non-planar due to partial breakage of the \u03c0 system. This molecular distortion causes rapid relaxation on to the S 1 PES. A similar molecular distortion was determined at the S 1 /S 0 CI, leading to rapid relaxation back the electronic ground state for gadusol. The computed MEPs find no barriers to either CI [87] , providing evidence for the lack of fluorescence and high level of photostability observed for gadusol in the previous work by Arbeloa et al. [82] For gadusolate, Losantos et al. [87] determined that the first optically bright state was the S and had 1 \u03c0\u03c0* character. An easily accessible S 1 /S 0 CI was located, with the main geometry distortions being an out-of-plane movement of the negatively charged oxygen on the chromophore and elongation of the C=C bond. Further to this, a small out-of-plane distortion of the C=O bond was also found at the S 1 /S 0 CI. In summary, the geometry distortions at the CI points for both gadusol and gadusolate are similar [87] . The simpler deactivation pathway for gadusolate involving one CI may explain the lower photodecomposition quantum yield compared to gadusol [82, 87] . al.

Furthermore, a computational study on a model of mycosporine-glycine (glycine substituent at carbon three is exchanged for a NHCH group) by Matsuyama et al. [129] determined the species responsible for its UV absorption profileto be protonated on the oxygen at carbon one. In the same work, Matsuyama et al. [129] studied the effect of pH on mycosporine-glycine. The findings were that a small hypsochromic shift was observed for the absorption maximum at low pH (1-2) in comparison to pH 4 to 10 which remained unchanged. The shift at low pH was attributed to protonation of the carboxylate anion to give an overall charged species; see Figure 13 for clarity. From these findings, the authors concluded that the charge resonance through the chromophore, which is a result of the amino acid residue facilitating a zwitterionic structure (see Figure 13 ), is the reason for the low energy allowed transition observed in mycosporines, and is also responsible for their UV protective function. Matsuyama et al. [129] suggest that after photoexcitation, non-radiative decay of mycosporines likely occurs via the triplet state.

                "text": "To conclude the mycosporine discussion, it is noted that additional studies on the mycosporines, mycosporine-glycine (see Figure 13 for structure) and mycosporine-glutaminol-glucoside, have also demonstrated high photostability, as only small decreases in their absorption spectra were observed after continuous UV irradiation [81, 123] . Furthermore, a computational study on a model of mycosporine-glycine (glycine substituent at carbon three is exchanged for a NHCH3 group) by Matsuyama et al. [129] determined the species responsible for its UV absorption profileto be protonated on the oxygen at carbon one. In the same work, Matsuyama et al. [129] studied the effect of pH on mycosporine-glycine. The findings were that a small hypsochromic shift was observed for the absorption maximum at low pH (1-2) in comparison to pH 4 to 10 which remained unchanged. The shift at low pH was attributed to protonation of the carboxylate anion to give an overall charged species; see Figure 13 for clarity. From these findings, the authors concluded that the charge resonance through the chromophore, which is a result of the amino acid residue facilitating a zwitterionic structure (see Figure 13 ), is the reason for the low energy allowed transition observed in mycosporines, and is also responsible for their UV protective function. Matsuyama et al. [129] suggest that after photoexcitation, non-radiative decay of mycosporines likely occurs via the triplet state. However, Matsuyama et al.'s study does not map the MEPs or identify CIs to elucidate the photoprotection mechanism [129] . In summary, the additional substituents on the ring of mycosporines and gadusol/gadusolate compared to the simple mycosporine motifs may be the cause of the accessible S1/S0 CI. The accessible In summary, the additional substituents on the ring of mycosporines and gadusol/gadusolate compared to the simple mycosporine motifs may be the cause of the accessible S /S 0 CI. The accessible S 1 /S 0 CI demonstrates how mycosporines act as UV filters for microorganisms in nature. Certainly, further investigation into structures with a cyclohexenone core are warranted, in particular, structures that more closely resemble mycosporines and progress away from the simple bottom-up units studied by Losantos et al. [89] and Woolley et al. [85] . Such investigations will provide greater insight into the photoprotective capabilities of mycosporines and nature's choice to use them as UV filters. Furthermore, identifying substituents which improve the photoprotective properties of mycosporine motifs will, in turn, create a wealth of knowledge that can be applied to the development of nature-inspired UV filters for use in sunscreen formulations. It is noted here that the relaxation mechanism determined for mycosporines and mycosporine motifs differs from those found for the plant-inspired UV filters that were reviewed in Section 2.1. It is interesting that nature has adapted to synthesize these two different families of molecules, among a repertoire of different molecular approaches, to provide photoprotection for different life-forms.",

Building on Losantos et al.'s theoretical work [89] , Woolley et al. [85] used TEAS to investigate NN experimentally. Methanol and acetonitrile were the solvents used and the appearance of both TAS did not display any noticeable differences. The authors determined that following photoexcitation to the S1 excited state, repopulation of the electronic ground state occurred on a timescale of ~ 500 fs. Furthermore, the NN TAS in both solvents displayed a weak absorption beyond the final time delay of Woolley et al.'s TEAS experiment, \u0394t > 2.5 ns. This long-lived feature was attributed to any remaining photoexcited population either as a populated triplet state or as a photoproduct which is likely to have a low yield [85] . To summarize, the results for this study corroborate the theoretical work by Losantos et al. [89] that MAA motifs demonstrate promising photoprotective properties ideal for a UV filter.",

The four studied molecules (9-12) can be found in Figure  14 [84] . CASPT2//CASSCF methodology [119, 120] was implemented, similar to their previous study [89] , to determine the deactivation pathway of molecule 11. Initial photoexcitation was found to be through an S1 \u2190 S0 transition having clear \u03c0\u03c0* character [84] , similar to that found for the core components discussed above [89] . Two deactivation pathways were determined by Losantos et al. [84] and a PES diagram displaying these pathways is shown in Figure 16 . The first pathway proceeds via a high-energy S1/S0 CI, with the main geometrical feature being that of an out-of-plane distortion of the substituents on the cyclohexenimine ring, like that found for the core structures in Losantos et al.'s previous study [89] . On further analysis, Losantos et al. [84] determined that this CI is not directly accessible from the Franck-Condon region. The second deactivation pathway follows a sharp descent from the Franck-Condon region to a minimum on the S1, whereby one of the imine moieties on molecule 11 is twisted out of the plane. The authors identified that isomerisation of one of the C=N bonds leads to a different S1/S0 CI which is slightly higher in energy compared to the S1 minimum, <8 kcal mol \u22121 . Furthermore, no significant emission was observed at long timescales, indicating that molecule 11 can overcome the energy barrier and return to its electronic ground state. Analysis of the isomerisation CI concluded that isomerisation around one C=N is not efficient and an aborted Building on Losantos et al.'s theoretical work [89] , Woolley et al. [85] used TEAS to investigate NN experimentally. Methanol and acetonitrile were the solvents used and the appearance of both TAS did not display any noticeable differences. The authors determined that following photoexcitation to the S 1 excited state, repopulation of the electronic ground state occurred on a timescale of~500 fs. Furthermore, the NN TAS in both solvents displayed a weak absorption beyond the final time delay of Woolley et al.'s TEAS experiment, \u2206t > 2.5 ns. This long-lived feature was attributed to any remaining photoexcited population either as a populated triplet state or as a photoproduct which is likely to have a low yield [85] . To summarize, the results for this study corroborate the theoretical work by Losantos et al. [89] that MAA motifs demonstrate promising photoprotective properties ideal for a UV filter.",

The authors attribute \u03c41 to the evolution of the prepared excited state out of the Franck-Condon window towards the S1/S0 CI, whereby population to the vibrationally hot electronic ground state is achieved. The authors draw confidence with this assignment due to the good correlation between the \u03c41 lifetimes and the fluorescence up-conversion decay lifetimes. Losantos et al. [84] assigned \u03c42 and \u03c43 to vibrational cooling on the S0 state, with \u03c43 being vibrational cooling of colder states of the electronic ground state, which is corroborated by the blue shift of the absorption in the TAS (see Figure 17) . For molecule 9, an early time constant, \u03c40, is required for the fit to model the early times of the initial relaxation of molecule 9 as it traverses along the S1 PES and evolves out of the Franck-Condon region. Furthermore, the fitting of molecule 9 did not extract a \u03c43, which Losantos et al. [84] explain as being due to the vibrationally hot electronic ground state being shifted to higher energies with respect to the other molecules. [84] .

The authors attribute \u03c4 1 to the evolution of the prepared excited state out of the Franck-Condon window towards the S /S 0 CI, whereby population to the vibrationally hot electronic ground state is achieved. The authors draw confidence with this assignment due to the good correlation between the \u03c4 1 lifetimes and the fluorescence up-conversion decay lifetimes. Losantos et al. [84] assigned \u03c4 2 and \u03c4 3 to vibrational cooling on the S 0 state, with \u03c4 3 being vibrational cooling of colder states of the electronic ground state, which is corroborated by the blue shift of the absorption in the TAS (see Figure 17) . For molecule 9, an early time constant, \u03c4 0 , is required for the fit to model the early times of the initial relaxation of molecule 9 as it traverses along the S 1 PES and evolves out of the Franck-Condon region. Furthermore, the fitting of molecule 9 did not extract a \u03c4 3 , which Losantos et al. [84] explain as being due to the vibrationally hot electronic ground state being shifted to higher energies with respect to the other molecules.",

[84] was that \u03c4 1 corresponds to evolution out of the Franck-Condon region on the S 1 PES, \u03c4 2 corresponds to internal conversion from a relaxed S 1 state to the vibrationally hot S 0 state and \u03c4 3 corresponds to vibrational cooling on the electronic ground state. This second interpretation is proposed because as relaxation along the S 1 PES occurs, fluorescence should occur at longer wavelengths which would result in fluorescence and stimulated emission extending out of the probe window in the TEAS and fluorescence up-conversion experiments. Therefore, it is difficult to determine which interpretation is correct. However, it is noted that this second time constant assignment does not alter the photophysical properties of the studied molecules other than them having a slightly longer S lifetime. Finally, Losantos et al. [84] did not observe any evidence for isomer formation and no long-lived feature is present in the TAS unlike Woolley et al.'s study on NN [85] . Losantos et al. [84] concluded their findings by stating that they believe the photoisomerisation reaction coordinate is the favoured deactivation pathway for these phenyl-substituted MAA motifs. Their experimental data were unable to confirm this; however, this is likely due to the aborted photoisomerisation leading to recovery of the original electronic ground state of molecules 9-12 predicted by the computational calculations in their study [84] . In conclusion, the results from Losantos et al.'s studies are highly promising for sunscreen applications, as molecules 9-12 display efficient repopulation of the electronic ground state non-radiatively on ultrafast timescales [84] , low fluorescence and high photostability [89] . In this work, the authors explored a new family of MAA motifs containing phenyl substituents [84] , and determined that they follow a different relaxation mechanism upon photoexcitation compared to the previously proposed ring distortion from their earlier work on simple MAA motifs [89] . Taken together, this highlights that the substituent on the core structure of MAAs plays an important role in determining the relaxation mechanism that is observed. However, in the above examples, both mechanisms are highly effective for the role of a UV filter in sunscreen formulation.",

The MEPs of these MAAs are not reproduced here due to the similarity between those that have been presented throughout Section 2.2 of this review. Beginning with palythine, the same CASPT2//CASSCF methodology [119, 120] described above was implemented by Sampedro [86] and this work has been reviewed previously [62] . Both a neutral and protonated form of palythine was studied, and it was confirmed that the protonated form is the species that contributes the most towards the photoprotective capabilities of palythine. However, dependent on pH, it is likely that both species are present in solution, hence the author's choice to evaluate both MEPs. In the case of the neutral form, two different absorption bands were calculated: S 1 \u2190 S 0 having n\u03c0* character, and S 2 \u2190 S 0 having \u03c0\u03c0* character and a greater oscillator strength than the former absorption band. After photoexcitation to the S , rapid deactivation via two energetically accessible CIs, S 2 /S 1 and S 1 /S 0 , is reached by small geometrical changes resulting in repopulation of the vibrationally hot electronic ground state. On relaxation along the S 0 PES, the ground-state minimum of palythine is reached along with a slightly higher in energy (1.5 kcal mol -1 ) conformer. Upon direct photoexcitation to the S 1 , Sampedro [86] reported that the same S 1 /S 0 CI is easily accessible and leads to the formation of the same conformer supra.",

However, due to the strong absorption closer to the reported experimental value, Sampedro [86] concluded that the protonated form most likely undertakes the UV protective role. In addition, photoacoustic calorimetry performed by Conde et al. [77] confirmed that palythine relaxes mostly through non-radiative decay pathways and, further to this, has a photodegradation quantum yield of 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , corroborating the conclusions made by Sampedro [86] . This evidence for non-radiative decay resulting in efficient repopulation of the electronic ground state supports MAAs for their function as UV filters. As mentioned in Section 2.2.1 of this review, details on the experimental setup of photoacoustic calorimetry and photoacoustic calorimetry on MAAs specifically has been reviewed in previous publications [62, 83, [125] [126] [127] .",

[88] used first-principles molecular dynamics [133] on hydrated porphyra-334 to investigate the mechanism that photoexcited porphyra-334 undergoes to dissipate excess energy to surrounding water. The findings were that energy transfer occurred mainly through the activation of hydrogen-bond stretching modes among water molecules. Only the hydrogen-bond network of the solvent was disrupted during the simulation, and the first hydration shell of porphyra-334 remained unchanged throughout. The tightness of the first hydration shell hydrogen bonds to porphyra-334 indicates how efficient energy transfer can occur without disruption to chemical bonds in both the solute and the solvent [88] .",

                "text": "The later work by Hatakeyama et al. [90] investigated the electronic states of porphyra-334 using quantum chemical simulations, in order to complete the understanding of the relaxation mechanism it undergoes to return to its electronic ground state. In this work, the zwitterionic and less polar neutral forms of porphyra-334 were studied. After initial excitation to the S , relaxation along the S 1 PES leads to a S 1 /S 0 CI with non-planar geometry (primarily at the CN groups at carbons one and three), this is in contrast to the planar geometry found for the optimized S structure. This deformation results in rapid deactivation of the electronic excited state [90] , similar to that reported for protonated palythine [86] and the core components of MAAs [89] . Hatakeyama et al. [90] associate this geometry change with a \u03c0 electron shift from the cyclohexene ring towards the protonated CN group of the glycine or threonine arm, which triggers the sp 3 hybridisation of the CN groups in the S state. As the photoprotective mechanism is similar to those already reported in Section 2.2, no further details are given here. Porphyra-334 has also been studied experimentally by Conde et al. [75] , who determined the fluorescence quantum yield to be 0.0016, the triplet formation quantum yield to be <0.05 and the photodecomposition quantum yield to be 2-4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . These very low quantum yields lead to Conde et al. [75] concluding that porphyra-334 undergoes a rapid internal conversion from its electronic excited state to its electronic ground state, which is corroborated by the theoretical work [88, 90] . Later work using photoacoustic calorimetry by Conde et al. [76] quantitatively determined that between 96 and 98% of the absorbed energy upon photoexcitation is rapidly released to the surroundings as heat for porphyra-334. The efficient repopulation of the electronic ground state, low fluorescence quantum yields and low triplet formation quantum yields for porphyra-334 highlights the promising characteristics that are required for a UV filter in sunscreen formulation. Such properties lower the probability for competing side reactions, which may result in harmful photoproduct or radical formation.",

                "text": "Moreover, a previous publication by Klisch et al. [134] elucidated the structure of porphyra-334 to most likely be protonated on the imine nitrogen on carbon one (either as a zwitterion or as the protonated form; see Figure 18a ). This was concluded by comparing density functional theory (DFT) chemical shift predictions to several experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Whilst Sampedro [86] determined that protonated palythine is responsible for the UV-absorbing properties compared to its neutral form, and Hatakeyama et al. [90] determined that the zwitterionic form of porphyra-334 was responsible for the UV-absorbing properties, neither study performed a comparison between the protonated form and the zwitterionic form. A study on shinorine by Matsuyama et al. [129] performed such calculations, and took experimental data over a broad pH range (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . The findings were the same as those discussed in Section 2.2.1 for mycosporine-glycine; over the pH range 4-10, the maximum absorbance did not change, but, at pH to 2, a small hypsochromic shift was observed. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that protonation on the chromophore, which facilitates charge resonance, permits the low energy allowed transition observed in MAAs and is responsible for their UV protective function. At pH 4-10, the overall species in neutral, and at pH 1-2, further protonation of the carboxylate anion generates an overall charged species; see Figure 18b for clarity. Additionally, they found shinorine to have a low fluorescence quantum yield (2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), similar to the fluorescence quantum yield previously reported by Conde et al. [76] ((1.6 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). This lead to the authors' conclusion that the dominant relaxation pathway is non-radiative, possibly via the triplet state. Again, it is added here that Matsuyama et al.'s study did not directly examine the MEPs or CIs to determine the relaxation pathway [129] . In addition, Conde et al. [76] determined that the triplet formation quantum yield for shinorine was <0.05, and that between 96 and 98% of shinorine rapidly dissipates absorbed UVR as heat to its surroundings. Taken together, these findings highlight the photoprotective capabilities of MAAs; rapid non-radiative decay dominates, lowering the chance for competing reactive pathways that may result in harmful photoproducts. Furthermore, Klisch et al. [134] found that the computed proton affinity of neutral porphyra-334 was high and, as a result, it behaves as a 'proton sponge'. The authors attribute this to porphyra-334 s ability to delocalize the positive charge throughout the chromophore. This is further corroborated by Zhang et al.'s study, which found porphyra-334 to be stable below pH 12 but decompose at pH 12 and above [135] . Such knowledge may have important implications for the commercial industry during formulation production in choosing ingredients and pHs to work at. observed in MAAs and is responsible for their UV protective function.

This photoprotective mechanism occurs through the main geometric deformation of an out-of-plane distortion of the substituents on the ring. However, this is not the case when phenyl rings are substituted on to the core structure and instead deactivation favours the aborted isomerisation pathway [84] ; this is similar to the decay mechanism observed for plant-inspired UV filters (see Section 2.1), the difference being that evidence for the generation of both isomers was present for those molecules. Further work is certainly warranted on the effect of the substituents on the ring and the favoured deactivation pathway as a result. Nevertheless, all work conducted on MAAs and MAA motifs have demonstrated desirable properties of UV filters and this deeper understanding of the photoprotective mechanisms could help guide the future design on UV filters.",

It is important that such work is continued across UV filter research in order to determine any differences between the photodynamics of the targeted molecule in solution and on a skin mimic. The closer to real life the system studied is, the more pertinent the results are to real-world application. Furthermore, an improved knowledge of how UV filters behave on a skin mimic will ultimately aid future design of UV filters.",

Introducing the vibrational analogue of TEAS, transient vibrational absorption spectroscopy (TVAS) to study nature-inspired UV filters could aid their molecular design, given that TVAS can detect molecular structural changes, such as chemical bond formation or breakage. Such processes cannot be confirmed by probing the electronic state alone using TEAS. At present, there is only one example of the use of TVAS for sunscreen applications-a study on oxybenzone by Baker et al. [105] . In addition to the ability TVAS has to detect molecular structural changes, it is also possible to extract GSB recovery quantum yields [138] [139] [140] [141] , something that is again difficult to achieve in a TEAS experiment. For example, in Baker et al.'s study, photoproduct formation quantum yields were reported and this was achieved through analysis of the incomplete GSB recovery from their TVAS spectra [105] . In combination with computational calculations, TVAS could be a very powerful technique for aiding the analysis of the photodynamical processes occurring in nature-inspired UV filters, and more broadly speaking, all UV filters.",

The 2DES is an ultrafast laser spectroscopy used to monitor the energy and spatial landscape of a system in an electronically excited state following interaction with a sequence of three laser pulses. It is particularly useful in systems with multiple interacting components for tracking excited-state energy transfer processes. Likewise, it allows one to extract the species responsible for an absorption or emission signal observed in the excited state [142, 143] . This information is often difficult to observe by probing the electronic state using TEAS. On the other hand, 2DVS provides information relating to the system under investigation in the electronic ground state, following photoexcitation. While 2DES and 2DVS have found applications in exploring the photochemistry of biological and material samples [144] [145] [146] , there is currently no literature reporting their use in UV filter applications. In combination with TEAS, TVAS and computational methods, 2DES and 2DVS could provide complementary information aiding the understanding of UV filter photodynamics and their molecular design.",

                "text": "In conclusion, this review has outlined the developments being made in investigating nature-inspired UV filters. Two distinctive directions have been highlighted-plant-inspired and microbial-inspired UV filters. To summarize, the UV spectra and photostability studies on nature-inspired UV filters reported within the literature have revealed that they absorb UV strongly in the region of UV-B and UV-A and are photostable. This is promising, given the sparsity of photostable commercial UV-A filters. Further, the photoprotective mechanisms for plant-inspired UV filters presented in Section 2.1 largely involve efficient and non-radiative relaxation to dissipate the absorbed energy via a trans-cis photoisomerisation. This relaxation pathway often results in the formation of the isomer as a long-lived photoproduct. As discussed, recent work by Horbury et al. [115] , reviewed in Section 2.1.3, has highlighted that appropriate structural modifications could prevent the formation of the isomer photoproduct. In the case of most microbial-inspired UV filters presented in Section 2.2, the proposed photoprotective mechanism involves an out-of-plane geometric distortion of the substituents on the ring. However, when MAA motifs are substituted with a phenyl ring, a second photoprotective mechanism becomes available; this being an aborted photoisomerisation pathway which was determined through computational calculations and the absence of isomer formation. This differs from the results observed for plant-inspired UV filters, as isomer formation was evident for all except the symmetrically functionalized sinapate ester, of which the cis and trans isomers are the same. Both families of nature-inspired UV filters warrant further work to improve the knowledge of the photoprotective mechanisms understood thus far. In particular, substituent effect is an area to be further investigated in the hope of enhancing future UV filter design. Furthermore, this review has touched on work that has mimicked a close-to-real environment and highlighted how important such experiments are towards understanding the photoprotective mechanisms for the application of UV filters in commercial sunscreens. Finally, promising UV filter candidates have been identified throughout this review and, with future work, it is possible that next-generation UV filters could be nature-inspired. With this in mind, nature-inspired UV filters could tackle some of the drawbacks currently faced centred around human and ecotoxic concerns of current UV filters. ",

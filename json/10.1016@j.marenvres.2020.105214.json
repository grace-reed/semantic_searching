                "text": "Molecular mechanisms such as natural selection and genetic drift have long been known to explain the evolutionary trajectory of organisms (Kronholm et al. 2017; Darwin & Wallace, 1858) . In light of rapid adaptation, epigenetic processes have gained attention for their capability to decipher stress plasticity resulting from the production of epigenetic variants via environmental induction (Vogt, 2017; Waddington, 1953; Lamarck, 1802) . Studies have shown that genetic variation only explains partly the adaptive strategy (Gavery et al. 2018; Kronholm et al. 2017) . While adaptive evolution is accomplished by genetic changes through mutation and selection, the process is expected to take thousands of years for many species. On the other hand, epigenetic mechanisms can provide an alternative source of phenotypic change for rapid adjustments to environmental fluctuations (Liu et al. 2018) . DNA methylation, being the most-widely studied epigenetic modification has been proposed to be an important mechanism of gene regulation in response to external environmental stresses (Thiebaut et al. 2019) . Stress exposure sets a series of functionally relevant modifications in the genome without changing the underlying original sequence of DNA (Eirin-Lopez & Putnam, 2019) , affecting gene activity through adding or removing a methyl group to the DNA cytosine (Suzuki & Bird, 2008; Song et al. 2005) . DNA methylation is therefore a pivotal mechanism to understand stress plasticity in the face of changing climate that includes the rising carbon dioxide (CO ) level in marine habitats (Fox et al. 2019) .",

                "text": "The unprecedented increase rate of CO level in the ocean is one of the prominent environmental stressors for many calcifying organisms in marine ecosystem. The phenomenon of nearly one-third of CO emission of anthropogenic sources soaked into the ocean resulting in a shift in seawater carbonate chemistry towards a reduced pH environment is termed as ocean acidification (OA) (Caldeira & Wickett, 2003) . As compared to open oceans, the estuarine and coastal regions experienced more land and anthropogenic disturbance and thus are highly sensitive to OA (Bauer et al. 2013) . Response of calcifying marine invertebrates to OA, including edible oyster species, appears to be highly species-specific. For instance, early-stage larvae of Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) showed no significant differences in shell growth between control (pH7.9/pCO = 803 \u00b5atm) and low pH treatment (pH7.5) (Boulais et al.",

In contrast, Suminoe oysters (Crassostrea ariakensis) and Sydney Rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata) showed hindered larval shell growth with a decrease in 0.3 pH difference from control condition (Miller et al. 2009; Watson et al. 2009) . Larvae of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) from the Yellow Sea had reduced metabolic and clearance rates but displayed higher shell growth rate after settlement under pH7.4 compared to pH8.1 (Ginger et al. 2013) . Larvae of the Hong Kong oyster (Crassostrea hongkongensis), which is an estuarine species, showed no significant delay in calcification or shell growth rates in response to low pH 7.4 when compared to control pH 8.1 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Page No. 4 (Dineshram et al. 2013) . Although few recent studies have shown the ability of many terrestrial organisms such as mammals (Rolland et al. 2018) and plants (Zlotorynski, 2019; Vannier et al. 2015) to rapidly adapt to external stresses through epigenetic mechanisms, existence of similar mechanisms is scarce in marine invertebrates, especially Mollusca. Therefore, exploration of DNA methylation changes and associated epigenetic modifications as a key biological process linked to stress and phenotypic plasticity could help to explain why some oyster species are resilient to OA.",

The availability of an annotated genome from C. gigas (Zhang et al. 2012) allows an opportunity of inter-species mapping and a comprehensive analysis of gene interactions and pathways of a closely related oyster species. Recent studies have described DNA methylation patterns in the C. gigas genome, with methylation level varying significantly across different functional categories of genes (Gavery & Roberts, 2010) . These pioneering DNA methylation studies in oysters have focused on developmental stages such as gametes and early larvae (Wang et al. 2014; Olson & Roberts, 2014; Rivi\u00e8re et al. 2017) , spats (Rivi\u00e8re et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2018) , as well as adult tissues such as gill (Gavery & Roberts, 2014; Rivi\u00e8re , 2014) and mantle (Wei et al., 2018; Song et al., 2017) . In particular, DNA methylation patterns correspond to different functional gene transcriptions that control reproductive (2-8 cells) and post-metamorphosis (spats) stages (Rivi\u00e8re et al. 2017) . DNA methylation on the exon level was found to be associated with mRNA expression in marine invertebrates (Flores et al. 2012) including C. gigas mantle tissue, suggesting that alternative splicing could be affected during transcription (Song et al. 2017 ).",

In oysters, the start of metamorphosis is signaled by development of a foot and a pigmented eyespot on a larval shell, of which the foot is required to attach on a substrate in response to microbial biofilm cues (Tamburri et al. 1992) to indicate that pediveliger larvae are competent for attachment. To date, data attributing DNA methylation to metamorphosis in oysters are limited. Wang et al (2014) reported marked difference in the expression level of DNA methylation related gene, DNMT3 of C. gigas pediveliger in comparison to other early developmental stages. Indeed, differentially methylated regions, especially the higher proportion of methylation in exons than introns were found highly regulated in C. gigas spats during post-metamorphosis (Rivi\u00e8re et al. 2017) . Investigating into the potential role of DNA methylation in oyster metamorphosis is therefore crucial especially in the face of unprecedented OA rates.",

Adults were fed adtum libido with a mix of Isochrysis sp. and Chetoceros sp. and conditioned at a salinity of 16 ppt to match conditions at the collection site. Seawater supply was filtered through a combination of fine and coarse sands with ultraviolet light. After acclimation, adults were introduced into a tank filled with cold (5-10 o C) and warm (28 -30 o C) water cycling to stimulate spawning. Fertilization of sperm and eggs pooled from a mix of >100 male and female oysters in the tank took place after a few hours of spawning. Fertilized embryos were sieved out using nylon mesh (25\u00b5m) to rinse excessive sperm and cultured in an enclosed pond (10000 L) for 24 hours. Oyster fertilization and embryogenesis in general are affected by reduced pH, which result in the production of heterogeneously sized D-larvae with varying degree of impairment (Barros et al. 2013; Thiyagarajan & Ko, 2012; Kurihara et al. 2007) . Hence, D-shape trochophore larvae with more or less similar shell size were used to increase chance of synchronous larval development. Similar sized (~70\u00b5m) D-shape larvae were obtained by filtering with a nylon mesh (65\u00b5m) and were used for the following experiment.",

In contrast, over 1/3 larvae raised from the low pH 7.4 treatment failed to select the biofilmed surbstatum over non-biofilmed sumbstratum (Table 1 and    Supplementary Table S2 ).",

In light of higher larval attachment trend under pH 7.4, we found nearly 1/3 of the C. hongkongensis larvae attached on substrate in non-biofilmed substratum (Figure 3 ). This however needs to be interpreted with caution given the pooled likelihood-ratio G value for pH 7.4 treatment was non-heterogeneous (Supplementary Table S2 ). Previous studies have shown a wide array of inductive chemical signals from the bacteria that induced larval attachment (Kegler et al. 2017; Tebben et al. 2011) with comparatively smaller percentage of attachment in the absence of biofilm (Freckelton et al. 2017) . We hypothesize that the attachment substrate, polystyrene dish surface along with microbial biofilm may be positively influenced by low pH condition in a way to induce better larval attachment conditions (Hassenr\u00fcck et al. 2017 ). Nevertheless the modulating effect of OA triggered by low pH on the inherent interaction between microbial biofilm and attaching larvae is yet to be explored in OA research. Further studies are required to enhance the understanding of low pH on biofilm choice to better explain the mechanism behind the larval selection. Our CpG methylation results helped in the identification of differentially methylated sites in response to ocean acidification and also shown the extent of OA effects at DNA level that could lead to altered larval growth and metamorphosis. A group of eight known Ras-and calcium-binding related proteins including sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 3 (NCKX3), and ras-GEF domain-containing family member 1B associated with cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction were differentially methylated, suggesting an increased demand for protein trafficking along actin filaments and cytoskeletal dynamics under the effect of ocean acidification (Lee & Dominguez, 2010; Baelen et al. 2004) . Genes related to NCKX3, which was hypomethylated at exon level, such as sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger and other related calcium-binding genes were found to transcribe in pearl oyster (Pinctada fucata) under low pH 7.8 as to the control pH 8.1 (Li et al., 2016) . Despite the discrepancy of the differences in oyster species and reduced pH level between the two studies, DNA methylation on the exon level in NCKX3 may imply an expression at a transcriptional level. A previous study reported by Dineshram et al. (2013) found a downregulation trend of similar ras-related proteins such as Rab-8A and RAB8A and calcium binding proteins on a proteome level from the larval tissue of C. hongkongensis pediveliger larvae under low pH 7.6.",

Protein ubiquitination, which can be activated by an increase in oxidative damage (Flick & Kaiser, 2012) These morphological changes were evidenced by the hypermethylation of caspase 7-like, a gene that play a role in apoptosis to maintain normal tissue and organ development and homeostasis (Lamkanfi & Kanneganti, 2011) , and Ia-related protein 6-like, a gene related to mRNA binding for ciliogenesis (Manojlovic et al. 2017) in response to ocean acidification. Previous studies have shown caspases expression in larval metamorphosis of C. angulata (Yang et al. 2015; Qu et al., 2014) and adult C. gigas (Qu et al. 2014) where the association of apoptotic pathways and DNA methylation were closely linked (Meng et al. 2011) . The differential methylation in these genes under the impact of reduced pH may likely be associated with the higher larval attachment of C. hongkongensis. Several genes that involved in the capability to respond to external microbial cue such as protein draper, and immune response related to phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, cell adhesion and motility (Ohno et al. 2016 ) such as multiple epidermal growth factor-like domain protein 10 (4.42; 0.02) were found hyper-methylated in response to ocean acidification. The epigenetic mechanism of increased number of methyl groups of cytosine from these genes may be suggesting a link between DNA methylation and the influence of biofilm on attachment rate without going through gene expression changes. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested explicitly in future experiments.",

In contrast, DNA methylation of intron may impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene and results in repression. Studies in humans showed that hyper-methylation in a gene promoter repressed gene expression (Lim et al. 2017; Silva et al. 2013; Bird, 1986) while in gene bodies, hyper-methylation enhances transcription of genes (Laurent et al., 2010) . DNA methylation of the first intron was found to be inversely associated with gene expression in tissues from vertebrates as well as invertebrates such as European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), model pufferfish (Tetraodon) and frog (Xenopus) (Anastasiadi et al. 2018; Rose, 2008) . It should be noted that DNA methylation landscape and presumed functionality is different in marine invertebrates compared to vertebrates. For instance, vertebrates displayed genome-wide methylation while invertebrates, including representative from molluscs displayed fractional methylation (Tweedie et al. 1997) .",

CpG methylated sites were found to concentrate in the exon region within the gene bodies, which suggests that the differentially methylated genes may also have altered gene activity profile. In general, differential methylation of genes were involved in cytoskeletal and signal transduction, oxidative stress, lipid and amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolic process, and metamorphosis. This implies the capability of Crassostrea hongkongensis larvae to acclimate and adapt to low pH 7.4 exposure within a single generation despite higher proportion of larvae chose poor habitat for attachment under OA. The differential methylation in the larval genes may have accounted for the higher metamorphosis success rate and poor larval substratum selection in oysters under ocean acidification-derived stress.",

                "text": "caused by low pH is evidenced with the differential methylation in a total of six known genes related to the ubiquitination of proteins, including the hypermethylation of exon-level E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase znrf3. A previous study found an up-regulation trend in transcriptomic response of ubiquitin-related genes such as Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 1, E3 ubiquitinprotein ligase SHPRH, UBR4, HRD1 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 in C. gigas larvae (Dineshram, 2015). These likely suggest a closely linked association of hypermethylation at exon region and upregulation of genes related to protein ubiquitination under ocean acidification stress. Similar proteins related to ubiquitination were expressed in the geoduck clam larvae under pH 7.5(Timmins-   Schiffman et al., 2019). It is interesting to note that heat-shock related proteins, which commonly are triggered by wide-array type of stressors were not found differentially methylated under the influence of reduced pH. Consistent with Dineshram et al. (2013)'s study on C. hongkongensis pediveliger larvae under low pH, heat shock proteins were not differentially expressed on the proteome level. This implies the highly plausible capacity of the larvae to acclimate to low pH without involving the addition or removal of CH 3 group in DNA nor going through proteolysis.",

This includes the hypo-methylation of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur protein 2, a gene related to mitochondrial ATP synthesis for energy production.A hypomethylation here suggests a possible upward shift in reaction rate of the methyl group in the gene regions related to amino acid and lipid metabolisms as compared to those related to metabolic metabolism. In other words, the contrasting trend of differential methylation indicates that the catabolism of amino acids and lipid may act as the alternative energy production role in C. hongkongensis larvae to cope up with ocean acidification in replacement of carbohydrate metabolic pathways. A proteomic study revealed an upregulation of isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, a protein involved in catalyzing branched-chain amino acids leads to increased oxidation of fatty acids and energy production during ocean acidification stressinduced metabolic activity of C. hongkongensis larvae (Dineshram et al. 2013). In geoduck clam larvae, high metabolic shift of proteins related to glucose and fatty acid was evidenced under low pH 7.5 (Timmins-Schiffman et al. 2019), in contrast to the carbohydrate metabolism and gluconeogenesis-related proteins in C. gigas that were expressed in low abundance regardless of pH conditions (Timmins-Schiffman et al. 2014). Larval metamorphosis in oysters involves the transformation of a swimming larvae to benthic sessile stage adult attached to a substrate. The development of an organ, such as a foot, and a dark eyespot during the pediveliger stage implies the high competence to metamorphose and attach on a substrate surface.",

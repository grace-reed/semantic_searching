                "text": "Chromera velia is a spherical green-brown alga found associated with corals in Australian reefs. Phylogenetic analysis of this seemingly insignificant organism found that it holds a unique relationship in the tree of life. C. velia is related to dinoflagellates, a large and diverse group of aquatic algae that live in freshwater and marine environments. Roughly half of the dinoflagellate species are photosynthetic, while the other half is strictly heterotrophic (Gaines & Elbrachter, 1987) . Many dinoflagellate species form symbiotic relationships with invertebrates and protists, such as Symbiodinium, a coral endosymbiont (Murray & Patterson, 2004) . Surprisingly, the other closest known relatives to C. velia are the Apicomplexa, a large and diverse group of obligate intracellular parasites. Many apicomplexan species are capable of causing serious diseases in human and animal hosts; well-known diseases include malaria (caused by Plasmodium spp.), toxoplasmosis (caused by Toxoplasma gondii), and coccidiosis in poultry (caused by Eimera) (Oborn\u00edk, Janou\u0161kovec, Chrudimsky, & Luke\u0161, 2009) . The effects of these protists on humans and domesticated animals are substantial economic losses worldwide and a devastating loss of life (Kim, 2004) . It had long been proposed that the Apicomplexa had algal ancestors (Cavalier-Smith, 1993) , but the discovery of C. velia provides a direct insight into what this ancestor may have looked like. Since the discovery of C. velia, its algal and parasitic properties have been explored to better understand the evolutionary shift from a photosynthetic autotroph to a parasite. The idea that the precursor to the malarial parasite was a harmless photosynthetic algae living at the bottom of the sea is both mystifying and thought-provoking. Better understanding of this missing link in the evolutionary chain allows a new perspective on these parasites that continue to cause havoc to civilization, and, perhaps, will provide us with the necessary insight to control them. This review will focus on the ecology and biology of C. velia and its significance in understanding the evolution of parasitism.",

                "text": "2. THE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF C. VELIA 2.1. The discovery of C. velia C. velia was first found in 2001 associated with the stony corals Plesiastrea versipora from Sydney Harbor, New South Wales, Australia, and Leptastrea purpurea from One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia (Moore, 2006; Moore et al., 2008) . C. velia was isolated during attempts to culture Symbiodinium, the major intracellular symbiont of these cnidarians. Moore adapted the method of York (1986) to select for Symbiodinium by first surface-sterilizing freshly collected coral \"nubbins\" in a pH-neutralized 1:25 bleach in seawater solution to kill any adherent algae, bacteria, or predatory ciliates. The assumption was Symbiodinium, which can be isolated from the feces of fish that have grazed on coral, would have a high tolerance to the oxidants, and would therefore be able to survive the action of bleach. A pressurized airstream was then used to remove tissue from the coral skeleton, and the coral tissue slurry underwent a series of shaking, centrifugation, and decanting processes to purify the algal pellet. The algal material was finally diluted in a seawater-based medium containing the chlorinating agent trichloroisocyanurate which acts as a bactericide. Cultures were grown in a 14/10-h light/dark cycle with low-light conditions and were then streaked onto seawater agar to isolate single colonies. C. velia was isolated and kept as it superficially resembles Symbiodinium. Two factors that were key to its discovery were that Moore had the curiosity and foresight to look further at this superficially uninteresting green-brown algal contaminant, and that C. velia is remarkably robust and survived well in culture and on plates. At the same time, Moore isolated a large spherical algal cell that was later formally described as Vitrella brassicaformis (see Sections 2.4 and 3.3).",

This study was also aiming to isolate cultures of Symbiodinium from the eggs and tissue of the coral when C. velia was found. The methods used were very similar to those of Moore, but also used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to separate algal cells based on size and emission. The similarity between the methods of Moore and Cumbo, and the fact that these are fairly standard algal isolation methods, suggests that these processes that were designed to isolate Symbiodinium are also relevant for the isolation of C. velia. It is therefore surprising, given the vast amount of Symbiodinium research over the last few decades, that C. velia had not been reported before. It is interesting to note that so far all isolations of C. velia have been made from the tissues of stony coral species in Australian waters, implying the possibility of a relationship between the alga and the coral.",

Genomic DNA of C. velia was extracted, and nuclear genes, including those encoding the large and small subunit rRNA, were sequenced (Moore et al., 2008) . Phylogenetic analyses indicated that apicomplexan parasites and photosynthetic dinoflagellates were the closest known relatives to C. velia, with the highest homology found to apicomplexan organisms. The positioning of C. velia among the main alveolate groups can be seen in Fig. 4 .1. C. velia was significantly different to these known groups of organisms, so a new phylum, Chromerida, was created. The etymology of Chromera was influenced by observations of the chromophores (pigments) of the meront (division products) being inherited through cell division over many years (Moore et al., 2008) .

Dinoflagellates are known to live in symbiotic relationships with a diverse assortment of invertebrates and protists, with the best documented being the relationship between Symbiodinium and corals (Murray & Patterson, 2004) . This association benefits the host coral through carbon transfer from the alga, while the coral provides nutrients and a stable home for the algal cell (Trench, 1987) . A recent study designed to test whether C. velia is endosymbiotic with coral was undertaken by Cumbo and colleagues using the scleractinian coral species Acropora digitifera and Acropora tenuis (Cumbo et al., 2012) . Aposymbiotic coral larvae of A. digitifera and A. tenuis were exposed to three cultures of C. velia (that were from the original isolations made by Cumbo in 2005) . Symbiodinium strain C1, originally isolated from A. tenuis, was used as a positive control. After 1, 2, or 3 days exposure to the algal cultures, the coral larvae were sampled and visualized under a fluorescence microscope to determine the density of cells within the larvae. Histological analysis was performed on A. digitifera samples at 2 and 5 days postinfection to further verify uptake of algae. Both species of coral larvae were found to acquire the C. velia cells and the Symbiodinium control. C. velia was present in the ectoderm (outer layer) and endoderm (inner layer) of the coral larvae for several days after infection, which is consistent with symbiotic dinoflagellates that are known to reside within the endoderm cells of corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish (Lesser, Mazel, Gorbunov, & Falkowski, 2004) . These results suggest that C. velia has the potential for endosymbiosis with coral larvae. However, further research is needed to confirm the nature of this relationship.",

Using phylogenetic analysis, they searched existing available prokaryotic sequence surveys for eukaryotic plastids. Numerous apicomplexan-related sequences were found, with nearly all of these originating from coral reef environments. A Chromera sequence was found associated with the surface of the coral Montastraea annularis from Cura\u00e7ao, Netherland Antilles. Several Vitrella plastid sequences were found that had been mislabeled as originating from bacteria, and the original samples were associated with corals or coral reef sediment from studies in Netherland Antilles, Bahamas, Philippines, Hawaii, Virgin Islands, and Israel. Other sequence clusters were identified that are likely to be unknown relatives of Chromera and Vitrella. These sequences were derived from coralassociated macroalgae as well as coral tissue, suggesting that the organisms may not be obligate coral symbionts (Janou\u0161kovec, Hor\u00e1k, Barott, Rohwer, & Keeling, 2013) . These findings have confirmed that Chromera and Vitrella are coral reef-associated organisms and provided insights into their global diversity. Further sampling of these regions should result in a variety of chromerid cultures that would support further research into this phylum.",

Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to characterize the features present in these stages (Moore et al., 2008; Oborn\u00edk et al., 2011; Weatherby, Murray, Carter, & \u0160lapeta, 2011) . The immotile coccoid cell is spherical to subspherical in shape and 5-7 mm in diameter, as seen in Fig. 4 .2. These cells use binary fission to produce two cells enclosed by a thin wall. Another round of division can lead to a cyst stage up to 9.5 mm in size that contains four daughter cells. The flagellates are slightly curved, eggplant-shaped cells approximately 5 mm \u00c2 3 mm that possess a short anterior flagellum and a long posterior flagellum, as seen in Fig. 4 .3.

This organelle is of specific interest because it suggests that the plastid was originally acquired through secondary endosymbiosis. Another unusual feature of C. velia is the chromerosome, a unique organelle made of fibers that resembles an extrusome-like structure (Oborn\u00edk et al., 2011) . This structure is able to grow and extend into a rod-like projection that protrudes out of the cell. There are no similar features found in apicomplexans, and although morphologically diverse, the extrusomes of dinoflagellates are considerably different (Leander & Hoppenrath, 2008) .

Intensive SEM and TEM work was performed on highly flagellating cultures and revealed that the cell transforms by ejecting two preformed flagella from the coccoid cell. An ultrastructural feature unique to the C. velia flagellate is a small, finger-like projection at the base of the anterior flagellum ( Fig. 4 .3) that may have photosensory implications. The flagellate also contains a pseudoconoid structure similar to protrusive rhoptries and micronemes in Apicomplexa that are used to establish infection. Beating of the posterior flagellum allows the cells to move at high speed in a zigzag pattern.

The flagellated form of C. velia is similar to dinoflagellates, colpodellids, and perkinsids in appearance. All of these organisms have a motile form with the basic structure of two dissimilar flagella attached to an ovoid cell. The C. velia flagellate is particularly similar to colpodellids and perkinsids. The zoospores of perkinsids are the infective form of a parasite that lives within host tissues, such as oysters. Colpodellid flagellates are predatory forms that attach to and engulf other protists (Brugerolle, 2002) .

Motility is an important ability used by marine microorganisms to take advantage of favorable environments, leave unfavorable environments, or seek a suitable mate for sexual reproduction. Light is a significant factor in the coral reef environment, particularly, for photosynthetic organisms that rely on the sun to gain energy. Light-induced movement has been observed in a wide array of algal organisms and is thought to aid selection of a suitable habitat (Yakobovitch, Benayahu, & Weis, 2004) . Oborn\u00edk et al. (2011) grew C. velia in a 12/12-h light/dark regime similar to that of its natural habitat, where it was observed to have a temporal cycle of motility over 24 h. The cells became motile 2 h after illumination, peaking after 4 h and reverting to an immotile state again after 7 h. Transformation between states was quick, and the flagellated state was observed to last up to 3 h before changing back to the coccoid state. Illumination was found to have a considerable effect on the percentage of motile cells, with a change in illumination from 3.15 to 35.8 W m \u00c02 causing a 10-fold increase. When grown under low-light conditions for 2 weeks, flagellation peaked at day 11, while under high light, it peaked at day 5. The related dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium, exhibits similar motility rhythms in a light-dark environmental cycle. Symbiodinium cells are motile only during the day, and isolates from different hosts have characteristic times for becoming motile (Sweeney, 1984) . Symbiodinium cells are held in the immotile form by host factors when in an endosymbiotic relationship, while the motile form is thought to be involved in establishing symbiosis and also sexual reproduction (Trench, 1993) . It is proposed that the coccoid form of C. velia behaves in a similar way to Symbiodinium by inhabiting corals. A sexual stage has not yet been seen in C. velia, although further research is needed to rule out the possibility. In the absence of a sexual stage, the flagellate is thought to spread to other parts of the reef in search of nutrients, a new host or an escape from high-light exposure.",

The act of swimming allows marine microorganisms to take advantage of nutrient conditions that vary throughout the vertical water column (McKay, Kamykowski, Milligan, Schaeffer, & Sinclair, 2006) . Nutrient levels in the environment affect the life cycle of Symbiodinium, with low nutrient levels inducing the motile stage (Ellegaard, Kulis, & Anderson, 1998) . To test for similar behavior in C. velia, Guo, Weatherby, Carter, and \u0160lapeta (2010) monitored the percentage of motile cells when grown in a range of nutrient and salt concentrations. They found flagellation to be suppressed at high nutrient and salinity levels compared to lower levels. A complete lack of salt or nutrients resulted in no flagellation, but optimal flagellation was seen with relatively low salt and nutrients. These results suggest a low-salinity and relatively lownutrient environment promotes flagellation during the diurnal cycle. The authors speculated that these suboptimal conditions might be a cause of stress that induces flagellation so that the cell can move to a more suitable environment or host. Several zooplanktonic organisms use diurnal vertical migration to adjust position in their habitat to optimize photosynthesis and escape predation, and it is feasible that C. velia uses its motility in a similar way (Nultsch & Hader, 1979) .",

It is thought that this common ancestor contained a chromalveolate plastid possessing chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c (Fast, Kissinger, Roos, & Keeling, 2001) . Peridinin dinoflagellates kept their plastid, while degeneration of the chromalveolate plastid occurred in other dinoflagellates and apicomplexans (Keeling, 2004) . Some dinoflagellates were able to replace the chromalveolate plastid with an ingested photosynthetic plastid, while other dinoflagellates lost their plastid and without the ability to photosynthesize turned to heterotrophy (Cavalier-Smith, 1999) . Parasitic apicomplexans retain their plastid as an apicoplast that no longer has the ability to photosynthesize.",

The small size of the apicoplast and the difficulties involved in working with pathogens have limited the research into the exact functions of the organelle (Okamoto & McFadden, 2008) . Recent studies have suggested that the production of isoprenoid precursors is the only essential apicoplast function during infection of malaria (Yeh & DeRisi, 2011) . C. velia presents a unique opportunity to study an apicoplast-related plastid and to clarify what functions the apicoplast has in parasite health and infection. The phylogeny of the plastid in C. velia suggests that at least some of the plastid biochemical pathways will be conserved with the apicoplast. C. velia can easily be cultured in the laboratory to high densities, allowing the plastid to be isolated and its structure and biochemistry studied. The ancestral nature of the C. velia plastid permits new research into the evolution of dinoflagellate and apicomplexan plastids.",

These protein structures surround photosystem reaction centers, which are embedded in the thylakoid membranes within plastids. LHC contain pigments that absorb light for photosynthesis, transferring it to photosystem reaction centers that turn solar energy into chemical energy (Green, 2003) . This reaction also produces organic carbon in the form of glucose. Three major types of pigments occur in photosynthetic algae: chlorophyll, carotenoids, and phycobilins (Rabinowitch & Govindjee, 1969) . As well as having light-harvesting functions, the carotenoids are able to protect against damaging photochemical reactions. Each pigment has a unique absorption spectrum, allowing it to absorb certain wavelengths of light. Red algae contain phycobilin pigments that absorb red and green light and allow the algae to live in deeper water or turbid regions where longer wavelengths are filtered out, and there is only dim blue-green light (Cole & Sheath, 1990; Rabinowitch & Govindjee, 1969) . Photosynthetic Symbiodinium contains chlorophyll c and chlorophyll a as well as the carotenoids peridinin, dinoxanthin, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin, and b-carotene (Hennige, Suggett, Warner, McDougall, & Smith, 2009) . Pigment composition has been used for many years as a criterion to taxonomically identify algae, with dinoflagellates being grouped according to chloroplast pigment patterns as well as morphology (Indelicato & Watson, 1986) .",

Pan, \u0160lapeta, Carter, and Chen (2012) used this idea to look at LHC genes from expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences of C. velia. Twenty-three candidate LHC genes were identified from an EST database of C. velia, and these were compared with sequenced LHC genes from other photosynthetic organisms by phylogenetic analysis. C. velia was found to have multiple copies of LHC homologs, and four different LHC groups were identified. Most of the LHC sequences clustered in a distinct group that was separate from all other known algal LHCs, but still closely related to dinoflagellates, diatoms, and brown algae. A group of three sequences were related to red alga-like LHC. This is interesting given that the light-harvesting strategies of red algae and C. velia vary significantly, and the presence of similar sequences is likely a relic from the evolution of C. velia from a red algal ancestor. Two sequences were found to be LHC groups of the yellow-green alga Vaucheria litorea. A single homolog grouped with the LI818/LI818-like protein sequences and its close similarity suggests that it encodes an LI818 protein. LI818 proteins occur in a range of photosynthetic organisms and have photoprotective roles under stress conditions (Zhu & Green, 2010) . Overall, the presence of different LHC groups in C. velia and their divergent proposed functions suggest that C. velia may not be as closely related to the red algal lineage as had previously been thought. The variation seen in the LHC of C. velia, diatoms, and red alga reflects the differences in light-harvesting strategies employed by these organisms that have adapted to survive in particular ecological niches.",

Too much light can lead to an increase in reactive oxygen species produced as a by-product of photosynthesis and these can damage photosystems (Muller, Li, & Niyogi, 2001 ). For shallow water corals, such as those from which C. velia was isolated, high light at mid-day is a daily stressor for the resident algae (Hennige, McGinley, Grottoli, & Warner, 2011) . Biochemical and developmental responses to light have evolved in algae to optimize photosynthesis and growth. Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) is a mechanism that protects photosynthetic organisms from excess irradiation. This process involves the conversion of the carotenoid violaxanthin to zeaxanthin, with excess energy being dissipated through heat (Muller et al., 2001) . Symbiotic dinoflagellates are known to utilize NPQ as a strategy to deal with high-light levels (Hoegh-Guldberg & Jones, 1999) . Photoinhibition (light-associated damage to photosystems) is a daily challenge faced by these organisms, so it is evident that symbionts with greater NPQ ability should be more resistant to thermally related bleaching.",

The presence of this mechanism in related species, and the fact that C. velia contains the carotenoid violaxanthin that is able to play a role in NPQ, prompted Kotabov\u00e1, Ka\u0148a, Jare\u0161ov\u00e1, and Pr\u00e1\u0161il (2011) to test for the pathway in C. velia. C. velia was compared to Nannochlorosis limnetica, a photosynthetic alga that also lacks chlorophyll c. Both organisms were grown in continuous illumination of 80 mmol quanta m -2 s -1 , and growth, chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics, pigments, and absorption spectra were measured. The cultures were exposed to a strong orange actinic light to test for NPQ.

It is known that in eustigmatophytes, such as N. limnetica, violaxanthin has a primarily light-harvesting role. Activity of the photoprotective violaxanthin cycle in these algae is restricted to extended high irradiances or temperature stress (Figueroa et al., 1997) . The light-induced deepoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin is unusually fast in C. velia, comparable only to diatoms that have a simplified one-step reaction (Goss & Jakob, 2010) . Vascular plants and brown algae show much slower rates of reaction (Garcia-Mendoza & Colombo-Pallora, 2007) . This efficiency in C. velia is likely due to the fact that violaxanthin is one of the major pigments, and its abundance allows for a faster reaction. Beyond its role in NPQ, violaxanthin was also found to have an important contribution to light harvesting, which is also seen in N. limnetica. Violaxanthin is therefore not only an active photosynthetic pigment in C. velia but also plays an important role as an effective photoprotective mechanism. In comparison, the violaxanthin of N. limnetica plays an important role in light harvesting but does not show significant deepoxidation or NPQ. This photoprotective quality may widen the scope of C. velia, allowing it to live in areas with particularly high-light levels. The reefs where C. velia has been found can be exposed to direct sunlight during the tidal change, and during this time, photoprotective properties would be necessary. These findings also have implications for Chromera as a symbiont, since they suggest it has adapted to high-light environments and does not need to rely on the protection of a coral host.",

Photoacclimation is a physiological response to changes in the light environment such as light intensity and spectral quality (Falkowski & LaRoche, 1991) . In photosynthetic organisms, photoacclimation results from alterations to the components of the photosynthetic apparatus (MacIntyre, Kana, Anning, & Geider, 2002) . To some extent, all algae are capable of photoacclimation, and strategies include changing the number of photosynthetic units or shifting the ratio of pigments to photosynthesis reaction centers (Falkowski & LaRoche, 1991) . Increasing the number of pigments and reaction centers can take advantage of extra irradiation, while different pigments are able to use different wavelengths of available light. The connection between the LHC and photosystem reaction centers is also important for the efficient transfer of energy. Maximum photosynthesis and production in algae is hence dependent on the efficiency of these photosynthetic mechanisms to successfully capture and utilize light energy.",

(2012) set out to investigate the efficiency of photosynthesis and the ability for photoacclimation in C. velia. Cultures of C. velia were grown in conditions of continuous low light (15 mmol photons m -2 s -1 ) and continuous high light (200 mmol photons m -2 s -1 ). Cells were also grown in a sinusoidal light:dark regime with a 12:12-h light:dark cycle that better simulates the conditions in nature. The light intensity was controlled by computer with the highest light level of 500 mmol photons m -2 s -1 at mid-day. Growth rates showed that cells in low light grew faster than those at high light, but it was the sinusoidal light conditions that had the highest growth rate, which was more than double that of the high-light cultures. These results reflect the adaptation of C. velia to its natural environment where light undergoes a daily cycle of irradiance.",

In contrast, high-light conditions resulted in a decrease in chlorophyll, but an increased carotenoid:chlorophyll a ratio. There was a high increase in the carotenoid violaxanthin, which would be connected to its photoprotective qualities. The diel periodicity of irradiation was found to be crucial in attaining maximal photosynthetic rates, with maximum photosynthetic activity observed at mid-morning.

Photorespiration can help dissipate excess energy at high irradiance levels by providing an alternate electron pathway to those that cause photooxidative damage. Photorespiration has also been reported in Symbiodinium, with the carbon compounds released being used by the coral host (Crawley, Kline, Dunn, Anthony, & Dove, 2010) . The carbon fixed in Symbiodinium can be used for respiration, maintenance, or growth of the alga, while more than 90% of it is translocated to the coral. The animal uses the carbon for respiration, growth, and formation of carbonate in the coral skeleton (Falkowski, Dubinsky, Muscatine, & Porter, 1984) . The high carbon-fixation rates observed for C. velia may mean that it can also supply carbon to coral or other organisms.

The importance of this pathway has resulted in it being highly conserved between all three domains of life. Only the first step of the pathway, the synthesis of d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), shows variation. Heterotrophic eukaryotes synthesize ALA in mitochondria from glycine and succinyl-CoA using a C4 pathway, and subsequent steps of the pathway take place in the cytosol and then back in the mitochondrion. In comparison, photosynthetic eukaryotes use glutamate and a C5 pathway (Panek & O'Brien, 2002) . This pathway takes place in the plastid of photosynthetic organisms, reflecting the need for the tetrapyrroles, heme and chlorophyll, in photosynthetic functions (Papenbrock, Mock, Kruse, & Grimm, 1999) . In Apicomplexa, heme synthesis follows a pathway that is a combination of those seen in heterotrophic and phototrophic eukaryotes. ALA is initially produced in the mitochondrion by the C4 pathway before it is exported to the apicoplast for the next three or four steps, with the remaining steps occurring in the cytosol and mitochondrion (Ko\u0159en\u00fd et al., 2011) .

The authors also radiolabeled glycine and glutamate for incorporation into the chlorophyll of C. velia and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. Radiolabeling showed that C. velia synthesizes chlorophyll from glycine and succinyl-CoA via the C4 pathway, while Synechocystis uses glutamate and the C5 pathway. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the C. velia tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway is made up of a mosaic of genes from different origins. These genes have the same origins as those found in the heme biosynthesis pathway of apicomplexans, indicating that they are ancestral genes. The C. velia pathway also incorporates four extra proteins that share an evolutionary history with photosynthetic eukaryotes. In C. velia, ALA is produced in the mitochondria before moving to the plastid for the rest of the pathway, reflecting the close relationship of the enzymes with those found in photosynthetic eukaryotes. The unique tetrapyrrole synthesis pathway of C. velia represents an evolutionary intermediate between the pathways of photosynthetic eukaryotes and apicomplexan parasites. When apicomplexans lost the ability to photosynthesize, they no longer needed tetrapyrrole products in the plastid. These results suggest that the enzyme isoforms were reduced to a single copy, and the last steps of the pathway were moved from the plastid to the cytosol and mitochondria.

C. velia was found to contain the plant-like MGDG and DGDG, with DGDG localized to the plastid membranes. There is also evidence for a plant-like galactolipid biosynthesis pathway. Plant-like MGDG and DGDG synthase enzymes were found to be encoded in the nuclear genome. These plant-like enzymes are responsible for the incorporation of galactose from UDP-galactose into MGDG and DGDG found in C. velia, which resembles the process in plant chloroplasts. Similar galactolipids have been found in dinoflagellates, providing further evidence for the common red algal origins of their plastids (Leblond & Chapman, 2000) . The lack of apicomplexan homologs to the galactolipid synthesis genes found in C. velia implies that Apicomplexa obtain galactolipids by alternate means, such as scavenging them from their hosts. With the loss of photosynthesis, the requirement for galactolipids by the apicomplexans would have decreased, so it is reasonable to assume that the biosynthesis pathway was also lost. Galactolipid synthesis is not present in animals so would make an ideal drug target. Further research is needed to verify whether this pathway is still required in apicomplexans.",

Sterol composition is closely connected to phylogenetic organization, allowing chemotaxonomic relationships to be determined (Leblond et al., 2010) . Sterols are also useful as biomarkers, with unique predominant sterols acting as a type of lipid fingerprint to identify organisms (Mooney et al., 2007) .

Leblond, Dodson, Khadka, Holder, and Seipelt (2012) were interested in finding genes for sterol synthesis in C. velia to determine the synthesis pathway as well as comparing these sterols to dinoflagellates in the hope of finding chemotaxonomic relationships or lipid biomarkers. C. velia was cultured and the lipids analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Five sterols were found to be produced by C. velia, and analyses showed that none were homologous with dinoflagellates, so these organisms cannot be linked chemotaxically. The sterols that were found have only been observed in unrelated algal and plant species, suggesting that the sterol biosynthesis pathway of C. velia is ancestral to several algal groups. Of the sterols found in C. velia, three were already identified and two were unknown. The three identified are common in other organisms and the unknowns are only found in small quantities, meaning that the sterols would not be useful biomarkers for C. velia. Examination of the C. velia EST database uncovered three putative sterol biosynthesis genes, and interestingly, these genes were found to be loose homologs with apicomplexan genes. This indicates an antiquated pathway in Apicomplexa that is no longer functional and has degenerated over time.",

During reductive uptake, reductase proteins in the plasma membrane change Fe 3\u00fe to Fe 2\u00fe which is then channeled through the plasma membrane into the cell (Kosman, 2003) .

(2010) to investigate the iron-uptake mechanisms in C. velia in comparison with the well-characterized S. cerevisiae. Both species were grown in low-and high-iron media, and iron uptake and reductase assays performed. C. velia was found to contain a novel iron-uptake mechanism, with a large number of iron-binding sites in the cell wall to allow iron to concentrate near transport sites. After concentration in the cell wall, these aqueous Fe 3\u00fe ions are taken up by the cells without prior reduction. This process and how it works have not yet been fully characterized, but it does not involve the use of siderophores or reduction of naturally occurring ferric complexes. This unique strategy may also be found in related lineages such as dinoflagellates or apicomplexans; however, at this stage, very little is known about the iron uptake in these organisms (Sutak, Lesuisse, Tachezy, & Richardson, 2008) . The high iron requirements for parasitic apicomplexans would suggest that an efficient iron-uptake mechanism would be useful. Better understanding of such a mechanism could lead to novel chemotherapeutic methods for treating the diseases caused by these parasites.",

This ordinary looking brown alga has the unique evolutionary position of connecting dinoflagellates to apicomplexans, enabling it to shed light on the shift from autotrophy to parasitism. The possibility of endosymbiosis with corals, along with its highly efficient and photoprotective photosynthetic system, demonstrates similarities and differences with the dinoflagellates that may be indicative of evolution toward parasitism. The biology and life cycle of C. velia and its fellow chromerid, V. brassicaformis, have many similarities to both dinoflagellates and apicomplexans, but it is the plastid that has gained the most attention. Its close relationship to the apicomplexan apicoplast may give C. velia an integral role in finding new drug targets for the parasites that affect millions of people each year. A prime example of this can be seen in the novel iron-uptake mechanism in C. velia: the ability to block the iron-uptake receptors in apicomplexans would lead to parasite death and would be a very useful therapeutic tool. Further research on the biological functions of C. velia in comparison with dinoflagellates and apicomplexans will help us to understand these organisms and, ultimately, may help find a way to defeat the parasites.",

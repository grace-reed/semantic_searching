In general, Holstein cows produce a relatively high amount of milk; however, they are sensitive to environmental changes, such as ambient temperature, humidity, airflow condition, and amount of solar radiation [14] . Interestingly, the susceptibility of cows to heat stress results in a reduced amount of milk production and feed intake. Several researchers have reported that Jersey cows, which are genetically different from Holstein cows [15] , have a distinct production-related phenotype. For example, Jersey cows display a lower total amount of milk production but higher milk protein and fat content compared to those of Holstein cows [16] . Their phenotype differences affect the high metabolic heat production associated with rumen fermentation and lactation, and ultimately, it may contribute to sensitivity to heat stress [17] .",

Despite the THI stress thresholds, variation among breeds in relation to milk production to heat stress conditions has been reported [21] [22] [23] . An early study suggests that the milk yield of Holstein and Jersey cows at a temperature of 29 \u2022 C and 40% relative humidity was 97% and 93% of normal, but when relative humidity was increased to 90%, it was 65% and 75% of normal [24] . In the study of the THI stress thresholds, it is reported that a decline in milk by the Holstein breed was more rapid than the Jersey breed across a range of THI from 72 to 84 [3] . Many other studies also reported that Jersey cows are more acclimated to hot and humid environments than Holstein cows, with constant milk yield and quality at a hot temperature [21, 22, 25] . Genetic differences between these two breeds may be unable to explain their physiological differences, suggesting that other factors may contribute to the differences. One potential explanation may be differences in the rumen microbiome. It is noticeable that heat stress conditions alter the rumen microbiome [26] . The rumen harbors highly dense and diverse microbial populations that play important roles in metabolism and health. The structure and function of the microbial community within the rumen is shaped by physical and chemical factors [27] , such as diet [28] , feeding program [29] , environment [30] , feeding behavior [31] , and animal factors [32] .

Repeated measures were calculated and considered optimal for a significance level of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an effect size of 1.0. Based on the power test, a minimum number of 16 cows were required as the total sample size. Statistical power tests followed the guidelines suggested by Cohen in the field of animal science [34] . Holstein (60 \u00b1 10.2-months-old; body weight, 715 \u00b1 54.4 kg; n = 8) and Jersey cows (57 \u00b1 9.3-months-old; body weight, 538 \u00b1 20.3 kg; n = 8) were used for the experiments. Holstein cows averaged a milk yield of All Holstein cows had been a part of the National Institute of Animal Science (NIAS) dairy herd throughout their lives, whereas the Jersey cows were born through embryo transfer in the uterus of Holstein cows and had been part of the NIAS dairy herd for over 40 months under the same management. Cows were housed in individual tie stalls and were fed the same diet twice daily. The barn was equipped with a fan system, which was turned on at 09:00 and turned off at 18:00. The diets of cows were formulated to meet or exceed the energy requirements and fed ad libitum as a total mixed ration (TMR) to avoid the selection of dietary components. A total of 20 kg of feed was offered at 09:00 and 16:00 daily to each cow. There were no orts from any of the cows. The ingredients and nutrients of the experimental diet are shown in Table 1 . 4 Provided approximately 5000 KIU of vitamin A/kg, 1000 KIU of vitamin D/kg, 33,500 mg of vitamin E/kg, and 2400 mg of vitamin C/kg.",

The THI equation used was devised by the National Research Council (NRC) [35] , and the equation is as follows: THI = (1.8 \u00d7 ambient temperature + 32) \u2212 ((0.55 \u2212 0.0055 \u00d7 relative humidity) \u00d7 (1.8 \u00d7 ambient temperature \u2212 26)).

Rectal temperature and respiration rate were used to determine the degree of heat stress and were both measured at 14:00. Respiration rates were measured by counting flank shifts during a 15-s interval and multiplied by 4 to obtain breaths per minute. Rectal temperatures were measured using a standard digital thermometer (KD-133, Polygreen Co., Ltd., Stahnsdorf, Germany). To reduce deviating measures, the average value was used by measuring each cow twice.",

Thereafter, the DNA library was concentrated, purified, and sequenced using the HiSeq\u2122 4000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). After sequencing, the raw sequence data files were demultiplexed and stored in the fastq format. The sequence data were assembled using an IDBA-UD assembler [41] . FastQC (FastQC; ver. 0.11.8) was used for checking the quality score of raw reads, and KneadData (KneadData; The Huttenhower Lab; http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/kneaddata) was used to improve the accuracy of the analysis; data analysis was performed after removing the adapter sequence. For gene prediction, contigs were assembled and annotated using Prodigal v.2.6 software [42] in the metagenomic mode, and the predicted genes were then annotated using the eggNOG database [43] with a BLAST search (E-value \u2264 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) and classified according to their functions. The obtained reads were taxonomically classified into the groups using the centrifuge method [44] , and the reads of each sample were analyzed using the NCBI database to determine breed information by group. The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method [45] , based on the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) sum-rank test, was performed to identify the difference in microbial populations in each group to characterize the microbial populations, from phylum to breed level, that were differentially abundant in the high-temperature stress condition. For this analysis, the critical threshold of the KW test was set to 0.05, and the algebraic linear discriminant analysis score [46] was set to \u22653.0. The set of protein sequences of the predicted genes was aligned with the KEGG gene database [47] [48] [49] using BLAST (E-value \u2264 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) to obtain functional annotation information. To confirm the quantitative difference of genes related to heat stress between samples, the bacterial heat shock protein (HSP) protein sequence registered in UniProt [50, 51] was obtained and analyzed against the genetic information of each sample.",

Physical muscle activity increases heat production by the body by increasing the respiration rate; thus, the respiration rate is well-known as a part of the mechanism of the body to release heat. Therefore, the respiration rate has been used as an indicator of the body's physiological response to heat stress, together with rectal temperature, in cattle [52, 53] . The THI has been used as an index for the environmental conditions [54] . It has been reported that the rectal temperature of cattle is positively correlated with THI. For example, in Holstein cows, in the normal condition, the rectal temperature range was 38.4-38.8 \u00b0C when THI ranged from 60 to 72 [55, 56] . In contrast, in the heat stress condition, with a THI range of 72-89, the rectal temperature range was 39.0-39.1 \u00b0C [57, 58] . The rectal temperature of Jersey cows is consistently lower than that of Holstein cows under the same conditions without solar radiation [21] . For example, Jersey cows display a mild heat stress response, with rectal temperatures ranging from 37.2 to 38.7 \u00b0C in a heat stress environment (THI 70-80) [59] . In general, Jersey cows showed lower rectal temperatures across the same THI range compared with those of Holstein cows, which have a 0.3 \u00b0C higher rectal temperature than that of Jersey cows. In addition, a decline in milk yield in Holstein cows in ambient temperature is more rapid than that in Jersey cows, with a THI range from 72 to 84 [3] . In our study, the THI values were 69.6 and 87.5 in the normal and heat stress conditions, respectively.

In the current study, the PCoA plots indicated that Holstein and Jersey cows had a relatively clear separation of microbial diversity under heat stress (Figure 2 ). However, there were no significant differences in Shannon and Simpson indices. Taxonomic bacterial compositions showed a similarity of predominant bacterial phyla between Holstein and Jersey cows (Figure 3 ). In addition, several studies have reported that diet composition and selective consumption highly influence ruminal bacterial diversity [61, 62] ; particularly, Firmicutes is a major phylum that can be altered by diet [63] [64] [65] . However, we did not observe significant changes in the phylum Firmicutes and other major bacterial phyla in our study. Therefore, we assume that certain changes in the rumen microbiome may not be fully explained by differential or selective diet intake by Holstein and Jersey cows.",

                "text": "Interestingly, we observed differential changing patterns of the rumen microbiome between Holstein and Jersey cows under heat stress. In the assessment of the rumen's bacterial composition by 16S rRNA sequencing, heat stress conditions significantly increased the relative abundance of the phylum Fibrobacteres, class/order Fibrobacterales, and family Fibrobacteraceae only in the rumen of Holstein cows ( Figure 4A ). One possible explanation for this is that the Fibrobacteres group (phylum to order) has stronger heat resistance than other ruminal bacteria. In general, all microorganisms have specific favorable temperature conditions and heat resistance; therefore, each ruminal microbe proliferates differentially at certain rumen temperatures [66] . In this regard, an increase in rectal temperature in Holstein cows may provide a favorable environment for the Fibrobacteres group. The Fibrobacteres group (phylum to family) is linked to cellulolytic activity. Cellulolytic activity, as a typical metabolism of rumen microbes, enables harvesting of energy from the diet [67, 68] . The efficiency of rumen microbial metabolism is closely related to heat generation in the rumen, and heat generation can be indirectly estimated through the efficiency of bacterial growth [69] . The metabolism of microbes is inefficient when they do not direct all ATP toward their growth, as microbes utilize some ATP for maintenance functions, synthesis of reserve carbohydrates, and energy spilling [70, 71] . This inefficient metabolism occurs when the diet is limited, resulting in energy loss by methane production in the rumen. Webster [72] reported that based on the ratio of energy conversion to the final product of rumen fermentation, energy production with acetate was three times higher than that with propionate, and 15% of energy was lost to methane when animals were fed only hay. Currently, we do not fully understand the interaction between efficiency of microbial metabolism, including methane production and heat production, in the rumen. However, there is the possibility that inefficient metabolic responses by rumen bacteria may exaggerate heat production in Holstein cows in the heat stress condition. In addition, the relationship between ruminal heat production and specific microbes under heat stress conditions has not been clearly investigated. In our study, we could not conclude that the increased Fibrobacteres count observed contributes to heat production in Holstein cows at the ambient temperature due to a lack of available information. Acetate produces more ATP than other volatile fatty acid metabolisms [73] . Fibrobacteres are well-known to degrade plant-based cellulose in ruminants and produce acetate through fiber fermentation [74] . Furthermore, Ransom-Jones and colleagues [75] reported that glycosyl hydrolases of the phylum Fibrobacteres have the potential to produce carbohydrate activators, including cellulose enzymes, suggesting that Holstein cows may ultimately produce more energy with acetate in the rumen and/or energy spilling, and this particular energy metabolism may be associated with heat production in Holstein cows.",

In Jersey cows, the abundance of the Actinobacteria group (from phylum to genus) decreased by heat stress (Figure 4C ). Actinobacteria are classified as Gram-positive bacteria and have extensive capabilities to metabolize diet, in particular starch and starch-like polysaccharides and oligosaccharides, producing lactic and acetic acids as the main metabolic end-products [76] . In contrast, the abundances of rumen bacteria involved in fiber degradations, such as phylum Fusobacteria and Cyanobacteria, which are unable to process cellulose [77, 78] , increased in Jersey cows in the heat stress condition. Interestingly, we could not observe these changes in Holstein cows in the heat stress condition. Collectively, differential enrichment of rumen bacteria by heat stress between Holstein and Jersey cows suggests that rumen microbiome in Jersey cows may adapt differently and/or change in response to heat stress compared to those in Holstein cows. There is another possibility that the increased temperature of the rumen environment due to the ambient temperature induces a selection of the rumen bacteria that results in reducing heat resistance in dairy cows; rumen bacteria in Holstein and Jersey may undergo a different selection process in response to heat stress.",

When we consider that Jersey cows are better able to cope with heat stress conditions than Holstein cows, a possible assumption is that acetic-acid-producing bacteria such as the Actinobacteria group or Fibrobacteres may contribute to heat stress responses in dairy cows by increasing heat production in the rumen metabolism. As limited information on heat production by specific rumen microbes is available, future studies need to be undertaken to determine whether ambient temperature induces the selection of the rumen bacteria and to understand the role of the rumen bacteria changes in the regulation of heat resistance.",

                "text": "Although we observed differences in bacterial taxa in minor groups, there is still the possibility that the abundance of functional genes of the ruminal microbiome can be altered by heat stress. Several studies have emphasized that exposure to heat stress conditions results in the downregulation of metabolic pathways in the rumen [26, 79, 80] . Moreover, heat stress increases the abundance of genes for environmental adaptation [26] . In agreement with previous studies, in both breeds, genes for environmental adaptation were upregulated, but genes for metabolism were downregulated by heat stress in our study. It is worth noting that Jersey cows had a higher abundance of metabolism-related genes, including those related to energy, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism in the normal condition compared to Jersey cows in the heat stress condition. However, heat stress actively decreased the abundance of genes associated with energy and carbohydrate metabolism in only Jersey cows; thus, both breeds had a similar abundance level of genes for these metabolic pathways in the heat stress condition. Currently, we do not fully understand how reduced abundances of genes for energy, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism are associated with reduced heat stress responses in Jersey cows. However, one clear finding from this study is that rumen microbiota in Jersey cows more actively changes the abundance of microbial genes associated with rumen metabolism, unlike the microbiota in Holstein cows that undergoes no significant changes under heat stress. This finding is supported by the observation that the rumen microbial composition in Jersey cows changed more under heat stress. A more active and distinctly altered rumen microbiome in Jersey cows by heat stress may lead to enhanced heat stress resistance. Based on the differentially changing magnitude in the rumen microbiome, affecting rumen function [81] , we conclude that the rumen microbiota of Jersey cows has a better capacity to adapt to environmental challenges, such as ambient temperature, and this is possibly attributed to active shifts in the rumen microbiome. However, we did not observe differences in genes for environmental adaptation. This may be due to a technical limitation; therefore, a more specific approach to determine the abundance of genes responsible for heat stress adaptation is needed.",

Rosic and colleagues [84] reported that there are activation thresholds to the intensity of heat stress for each type of HSP, an important role of HSPs under diverse heat stress conditions in adapting to environmental changes, which indicate differences in HSP inducible expression. In addition, Richier et al. [85] suggested that environmental conditions may regulate the heat shock transcription factor for activation of heat-inducible genes and heat acclimation, and it is indicated by the difference in HSP expression. In our study, the abundance of HSPs was significantly higher in Jersey cows in the normal condition. However, heat stress increased the number of HSP genes in Holstein cows, resulting in similar abundance levels of HSPs in rumen microbes between Holstein and Jersey cows. This suggests that HSPs are not major players in the differential heat stress responses between Holstein and Jersey cows. Further studies are needed to elucidate the correlation between the abundance of HSP-related genes and heat stress in Jersey cows.",

More prominent changes in rumen bacterial taxa and functional gene abundance in Jersey cows showed that they have a weak heat stress response in hot weather, suggesting that these changes likely help in adapting to climate change. The THI was not adequately applied for measuring heat stress intensity in the Jersey breed, suggesting that THI index adjustments or other indicators should be designed to measure cattle heat stress intensity. We believe that our results provide evidence for changes in the ruminal bacterial composition in heat stress response in both Holstein and Jersey dairy cow breeds. In addition, Holstein cows, which are vulnerable to heat, may help better understand changes in ruminal bacteria and genes for further studies aimed at developing ruminal bacterial regulators. The limitation of this study is that the correlation between production parameters, such as milk component, ruminal VFA, and body condition, and microbial communities, was not explored. Future studies are needed to clarify the correlation between rumen microbial changes and gene expression and productivity under heat stress.",

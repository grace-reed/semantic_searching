Maternal CR partially rescued these effects, increasing the mean life span of AL-fed female offspring but not male offspring and increasing the fecundity of AL-fed female offspring compared with offspring of mothers of the same age. Both maternal CR regimens decreased male offspring body size, but only maternal IF decreased body size of female offspring, whereas maternal CCR caused a slight increase.

Such plasticity may evolve as an adaptive response to environmental heterogeneity or may be an indirect outcome of changing resources and stressors. Extended life span under caloric restriction (CR), for example, is thought to have evolved to delay reproductive senescence during times of resource limitation to allow reproduction to resume later in life when food is restored (Fisher, 1958; Kirkwood, 1977; Holliday, 1989; Stearns, 1989) . Alternatively, CR may cause a hormetic response, resulting in upregulation of protective mechanisms to defend against the stress of limited food, secondarily resulting in increased longevity (Masoro, 2007) .",

Monogonont rotifers are aquatic microinvertebrates that have been used in aging research for nearly 100 years (Austad, 2009) . Brachionus manjavacas is cyclically parthenogenetic, generally reproducing asexually, with amictic (asexual) diploid females producing diploid amictic female eggs through mitosis. In response to environmental conditions including crowding, some amictic individuals produce mictic (sexual) females. These mictic females, if unfertilized, produce haploid male offspring via meiosis. If fertilized by males, mictic females lay diploid resting eggs that overwinter in the sediments and hatch into amictic females, restoring the asexual cycle. All females are produced asexually from amictic mothers or are hatched from resting eggs; males are only produced by mictic mothers.",

In addition, rotifers have not undergone the genome reduction seen in some other invertebrates and thus may share more genes in common with humans than some model systems (Kortschak et al., 2003) . As monogonont rotifers do not care for their eggs or offspring, they provide a good model for separating the influences of parental care from maternal effects on offspring fitness. Under our culture conditions and depending on feeding regimen, amictic B. manjavacas females hatched from amictic eggs have a prereproductive (neonate) stage of 1-2 days, reach maximum reproductive output at day 4-6, produce 22-32 eggs and live an average of 8-12 days (Gribble & Mark Welch, 2013 ).

By 48 h, daughters of 7-day-old AL mothers were nearly twice the volume of daughters born to 3-day-old AL mothers and were significantly larger than daughters born to 5-day-old AL mothers.

Similar maternal age effects have been seen across a wide range of species (Priest et al., 2002) . Lansing showed that this declining fitness was cumulative across generations of rotifers to the point that cultures continually derived from offspring of older mothers died out after several generations, whereas cultures from young mothers could be maintained indefinitely (Lansing, 1947 (Lansing, , 1954 . An increase in the accumulation of carbonylated proteins in the offspring of older mothers, suggesting oxidative damage, has been seen in the copepod Acartia tonsa, another aquatic microinvertebrate (Rodr \u0131guez-Gra\u00f1a et al., 2010). With increasing maternal age, protein banding patterns in bdelloid rotifers show decreased protein concentration and increased variability in both maternal females and their offspring (Ricci et al., 1999) , suggesting protein disregulation that is passed on to daughters of older mothers. The negative life span effects on offspring of increasing maternal age may be due to a combination of processes acting on the germline: epigenetic changes affecting gene expression, accrual of protein damage, mutation accumulation (Medawar, 1952) and antagonistic pleiotropy (Williams, 1957) . While these mechanisms are generally considered for their effects directly on aging in the individual, this study and others suggest that they should be considered in a transgenerational context and that maternal effects should be incorporated into evolutionary theories of aging (Priest et al., 2002) .",

The maternal rotifers we used in our experiments were themselves the offspring of females of mixed ages, thus their mean life span was influenced by a wide range of maternal ages. The mean life span in early-born (day 3) offspring was 19% higher than that of their AL-fed mothers, even without the added benefits of maternal CR.

This transgenerational life span increase is of similar magnitude to that seen in a strain of B. plicatilis fed a different species of algae under IF conditions (Kaneko et al., 2011) . Our demonstration that maternal CCR also increases offspring life span is significant because the beneficial effects of CCR and IF may act through overlapping, but not identical pathways in rotifers, as is the case in other animals (Greer et al., 2007; Greer & Brunet, 2009; Cleary & Grossmann, 2011; Dogan et al., 2011; Gribble & Mark Welch, 2013; Gribble et al. 2014) .

As all mothers fed AL for the first 24 h, CR mothers were only exposed to CCR for 48 h or to one round of 24-h fasting by day 3. This suggests that the physiological reaction triggering the epigenetic response is not an instantaneous result of exposure to low food levels. Whether working through nutrient sensing, metabolic and/or stress pathways, or other mechanisms, the initiation of the transgenerational response appears to require extended CR. Alternatively, there may be a developmental window during which exposure to maternal CR can lead to changes in offspring aging. Perhaps the day 3 offspring, already developing embryos within the first 24 h of the experiment, had exited this window before CR began. Future studies might examine how short-term CR or starvation exposures at different maternal ages translate into effects on offspring aging, to determine the timing and trigger for the maternal effect.",

Male rotifers do not eat and thus presumably lack expression of metabolic genes involved in food digestion and metabolism; the maternal CR effect may be working, at least in part, through these pathways in daughters. Thus, if the maternal CR effect acts on IGF-1 and/or AMPK signaling in females, we might see that these mechanisms are essentially shut down in male offspring. Alternatively, the maternal CR effect may be indirect, acting through stress-response (hormesis) mechanisms or invoking epigenetic changes that are passed on to daughters, but not sons. Additionally, the meiotic origin of males may somehow block the maternal effects expressed in mitotically derived female offspring. Whether the maternal age effect works through the same, overlapping or separate pathways remains to be determined through comparative transcriptomic, protein activity and gene knock-down studies.

The body size of both male and female offspring increased significantly with increasing maternal age. Partridge & Fowler (1992) also found larger body size in lines of Drosophila derived from old mothers than from those derived from young mothers. We expected that the decreased energy intake of CR mothers would result in decreased body size of offspring compared with those of AL mothers. In a classic 'trade-off' situation, CR mothers, with their extended life span, would have fewer energy resources to invest in offspring. However, we observed that while maternal CR of either regimen reduced the size of males born to older mothers, only maternal IF reduced the size of daughters. The difference in body size outcome depending on maternal CR regimen suggests differences in the mechanism of life span extension between CCR and IF. How these changes in body size might translate to fitness effects in the natural environment is likely quite complicated. For example, as body size increases, swimming speed also increases, which could aid in escape from larger predators. However, increased swimming speed leads to more encounters with predatory zooplankton and thus might increase predation risk (Preston et al., 1999) . Understanding how differences in body size between male and female offspring due to maternal age and CR effects affect swimming speed and mating would provide insights into its adaptive significance.",

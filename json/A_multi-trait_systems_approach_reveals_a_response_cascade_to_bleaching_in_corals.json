    "abstract": "Background: Climate change causes the breakdown of the symbiotic relationships between reef-building corals and their photosynthetic symbionts (genus Symbiodinium), with thermal anomalies in 2015-2016 triggering the most widespread mass coral bleaching on record and unprecedented mortality on the Great Barrier Reef. Targeted studies using specific coral stress indicators have highlighted the complexity of the physiological processes occurring during thermal stress, but have been unable to provide a clear mechanistic understanding of coral bleaching. Results: Here, we present an extensive multi-trait-based study in which we compare the thermal stress responses of two phylogenetically distinct and widely distributed coral species, Acropora millepora and Stylophora pistillata, integrating 14 individual stress indicators over time across a simulated thermal anomaly. We found that key stress responses were conserved across both taxa, with the loss of symbionts and the activation of antioxidant mechanisms occurring well before collapse of the physiological parameters, including gross oxygen production and chlorophyll a. Our study also revealed species-specific traits, including differences in the timing of antioxidant regulation, as well as drastic differences in the production of the sulfur compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate during bleaching. Indeed, the concentration of this antioxidant increased twofold in A. millepora after the corals started to bleach, while it decreased 70% in S. pistillata. Conclusions: We identify a well-defined cascading response to thermal stress, demarking clear pathophysiological reactions conserved across the two species, which might be central to fully understanding the mechanisms triggering thermally induced coral bleaching. These results highlight that bleaching is a conserved mechanism, but specific adaptations linked to the coral's antioxidant capacity drive differences in the sensitivity and thus tolerance of each coral species to thermal stress.",

Despite their ecological importance and persistence over geological time, coral reefs are one of the most vulnerable marine ecosystems in a changing climate [3] [4] [5] . Seawater temperatures above monthly and annual averages have been linked to cellular damage in the algal symbionts and coral host, leading to the breakdown of the symbiosis and subsequent expulsion or loss of symbionts from the host, a process termed coral bleaching [6] .",

                "text": "Early attempts to characterise the cellular mechanisms behind coral bleaching focused primarily on the physiology of the symbiont [7] , where stress-induced impairment of photosynthesis was demonstrated to increase formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing further damage to the photosynthetic machinery [6, 8, 9] . As such, historically, coral bleaching has chiefly been described as a result of the symbiont response to stressors [7, 10, 11] . With the advance in molecular techniques, it became apparent that corals can form symbioses with multiple Symbiodinium clades [12] [13] [14] , some of which are more thermally tolerant than others [15, 16] , which has proved to be of significance to the overall sensitivity of a coral to bleaching conditions. Nonetheless, bleaching susceptibility differs widely among different coral genera despite often hosting the same Symbiodinium clade [17, 18] as well among individual corals hosting the same symbiont type [17] [18] [19] , suggesting that host physiology plays a key role in the bleaching process.",

Yet, it is widely agreed that oxidative stress in the symbiont and/or host plays a key role in the breakdown of the symbiotic partnership [21, 22] . Highly conserved enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems operate in both the host and the symbiont simultaneously and, thus, accurately describing the localised antioxidant response is challenging. In corals, key antioxidants are essential for maintaining cell homeostasis and modulating stress-induced ROS in the cell. These include superoxide dismutase (SOD), an endogenous antioxidant which reduces the damaging potential of superoxide anion radicals (O 2",

This organosulfur compound, together with its breakdown products, dimethylsulfide (DMS) and acrylate, can function as an effective antioxidant system [24] . Upon reacting with ROS, DMSP and DMS are oxidised to form dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which constitutes a secondary shield against ROS that can be further oxidised. In adult corals, DMSP is produced by Symbiodinium [25] , and is also highly likely synthesised by the cnidarian host [26] and some associated bacteria [27] .

To estimate the rate of adaptation and acclimation under a changing climate, we need to understand how corals respond to various environmental stressors through the expression of functional traits [29] . Mounting evidence suggests that the response of corals and their symbionts varies significantly in terms of timing and severity of the expression of key metabolic genes [30] , but also that the cnidarian host responses precede the bleaching process and symbiont dysfunction [7, [31] [32] [33] .

Oxygen concentration was measured every 1 to 2 min in each chamber until a linear change in rate was recorded for each replicate, with measurements taken first in the dark and subsequently in the light (300 \u03bcmol photons m -2 s -1 ). Gross photosynthesis (\u0394O 2 [light]-\u0394O 2 [dark]), respiration rates and P:R ratios (light) were calculated for each treatment (n = 5) and time-point.

Coral fragments were stored in 3 mL of methanol at \u221220\u00b0C until processing. Immediately prior to processing, coral fragments were extracted a second time with 1 mL of HPLC-grade methanol (CH 3 OH) for 1 min with sonication on ice. The two extracts were pooled and dried using a concentrator (Savant SpeedVac, Thermo Scientific, USA). The dried extracts were resuspended in a mixture of deuterated methanol (CD 3 OD; 750 \u03bcL) and deuterium oxide (D 2 O; 250 \u03bcL), vortexed to solubilise the compounds and then centrifuged to pellet the debris. A 700-\u03bcL aliquot of the particulate-free extract was transferred into a 5-mm Norell 509-UP NMR tube and analysed immediately by 1 H qNMR. Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) with a TXI cryoprobe, referenced using CD 3 OD (\u03b4 H 3.31). Spectra were acquired following the methods in Tapiolas et al. [44] . After calibration, the concentrations of DMSP and DMSO in the NMR sample were determined by comparing the signal integrals of well resolved nonexchangeable protons (CH 3 ) 2 SCH 2 CH 2 CO 2 centred at \u03b4 2.95 ppm for DMSP and (CH 3 ) 2 SO \u03b4 2.73 ppm for DMSO in a 0.20 ppm window against the electric reference signal [45] . Quantification was performed using the ERETIC method (Electronic REference To access In vivo Concentrations) [45] . This technique electronically generates an external reference signal during the data acquisition that is calibrated using stock solutions of 4 mM acrylate and DMSP [41, 44] based on the concentration present in test samples. DMS is soluble in methanol [46] but oxidises into DMSO over time in coral extracts [44] . Therefore, the DMSO signals measured here can be considered as a proxy for the combined DMS and DMSO (DMS/DMSO) pools. The surface area of the remaining coral skeleton was measured (as described above) and the DMSP/DMSO data were normalised to both coral surface area and Symbiodinium density.",

Analyses were carried out using Primer v.6 statistical package [47] in conjunction with the PERMANOVA+ module [48] . The majority of variables showed a significant interaction term between temperature and time (Additional file 1: Table S1 , S2), indicating that most data showed a temporal pattern that was dependent on the temperature treatment. Since significant interaction terms often indicate that the test for main effects is not very informative [49] , pair-wise comparison PERMANOVA tests were conducted for temperature at each time level and for time at each temperature level, utilising the Monte Carlo method. Significant differences in pair-wise comparisons at each time point are denoted with asterisks, while significant changes within a treatment over time is denoted by superscript lettering. Unless otherwise stated, all statistical results reported are from the PERMANOVA analysis. An independent samples t test was used to determine differences between species for the relative changes at the final time-point in the thermal treatment ( Fig. 4 and Additional file 1: Figure S9 ) using IBM SPSS Statistics v.21 (IBM Corporation, New York). The frequency of Symbiodinium OTUs that occurred in each sample was first standardised and square-root transformed, then used to generate a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix and one-way ANOSIM with species as a factor in PRIMER v.6 [47] , and a heatmap using the gplots package in R [50] .

In S. pistillata, gross oxygen production was significantly lower than the control by days 11 and 14 in the heattreated corals (pseudo F 3,31 = 4.88, P MC = 0.0087; Fig. 1f ). O 2 flux in the light (net photosynthesis) differed over time and treatment in A. millepora (pseudo F 3,31 = 18.70, P MC = 0.0001; Additional file 1: Figure S5a ) and S. pistillata (pseudo F 3,31 = 8.12, P MC = 0.0008; Additional file 1: Figure S5b ), with significant decreases in O 2 flux detected on days 11 and 14 (Additional file 1: Figure S5a, b ). There was a significant effect of treatment and time in the respiration rate for A. millepora (pseudo F 3,31 = 6.77, P MC = 0.002), with increased rates measured in the heat-treated corals on day 8 (Additional file 1: Figure S5a ). Respiration rates remained fairly constant in S. pistillata, although a significant decline from day 4 was detected on days 11 and 14 in the heat-treated corals (Additional file 1: Figure S5b ). There were significant declines in the P:R ratios with elevated temperature for both species (Additional file 1: Figure S5c, d) . In A. millepora, treatment effects were significant at day 8 and 14, while in S. pistillata, treatment effects became apparent on days 11 and 14. In both species, the P:R ratio dropped below 1 by day 14, indicating that the coral became net heterotrophic at the light level used (300 \u03bcmol photons m -2 s -1 ), supporting the reduced photochemical efficiency measured by the PAM data. There was a temporal difference in significant Symbiodinium loss (day 8) and gross photosynthesis (day 11) in A. millepora, which can be explained by increased self-shading. High Symbiodinium cell density results in lower photosynthetic efficiency, as seen in the relationship between oxygen production and Symbiodinium density (Additional file 1: Figure S5e ). This is congruent with initial cell densities of A. millepora being twice that of S. pistillata (Fig. 1c, d ).",

Prior to cell loss, changes to a few traits of both the host and symbiont became apparent in both species. In A. millepora, the antioxidant response was initiated in the host followed by the symbiont. In contrast, in S. pistillata, it was the symbiont that was the first to respond followed by the host on day 8. Post significant symbiont loss (> 50% decline) major pathophysiological responses occurred in both species across multiple traits. In A. millepora, remaining antioxidants of both the host and symbiont responded and DMSP increased. In S. pistillata, we saw an increased thermal stress response specifically driven by host CAT and a decline in gross photosynthesis. By day 14, both corals boosted their antioxidant activity closely corresponding to the onset of a measureable decline in symbiont photophysiological health. Beyond this climactic pathophysiological response there was severe loss of photosynthetic function and symbiont density was reduced to less than 5%.",

This revealed in detail the time-course of the bleaching process, including species-specific pathophysiologies in response to elevated temperature (Fig. 5) . Importantly, the time-course revealed a well-defined cascade of conserved responses towards the bleached state. In both species, the initial onset of Symbiodinium expulsion preceded any severe pathophysiological responses of the host or symbiont and photophysiological health only declined in the last stages immediately prior to complete bleaching (Fig. 5) . The cascade described here demarks a previously undefined non-linearity in the bleaching process, from the initial adjustments in the corals' antioxidant systems, to the dramatic response correlated with a higher rate of bleaching and reduction in symbiont function. Using a systems approach, this newly described response-pattern, may provide important clues to the mechanism behind coral bleaching under elevated temperatures and the tolerance and sensitivity of various coral species.",

The graphical illustration of the changes to host and symbiont traits over time was constructed using Adobe Illustrator (CS6, Adobe Systems Software Ireland Ltd., CA, USA), where data points represent the magnitude of change (Fig. 4) for each trait that was significantly different from day 1 and the control at each time point (according to the PERMANOVA output). Lines are hand drawn interpolations of the change between time points with shading used to group host and symbiont responses to assist with interpretation. Photophysiological parameters (red solid lines and shading), host (pink solid lines and shading) and symbiont (green solid lines and shading) antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSx) and catalase (CAT)/CAT-like activity), Symbiodinium pigmentation (including Symbiodinium density and chlorophyll a; orange dotted lines and shading), gross photosynthesis (blue solid line), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) concentration (black solid line) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; black dotted line) are shown. The relative change is indicated by the left y-axis, note the change in scale for S. pistillata (b), where maximum relative change is 3. The time axis extends to day 20 for A. millepora because maximum/effective quantum yields were measured until day 20, whereas S. pistillata was more sensitive to thermal stress and measurements were not detected past day 15 symbionts on a daily basis, whereas S. pistillata is a vertical transmitter with tight specific host-symbiont associations [59, 60] and may therefore be more reluctant to release its symbionts. This difference in maternal provisioning may also explain the earlier regulation of antioxidant activity in the symbionts of S. pistillata. As a vertical transmitter, it may have an innate strategy for thermal acclimation through regulating its antioxidants, rather than attempting to regulate symbiont density via expulsion. In contrast, the flexibility in symbiont association of A. millepora may preclude metabolic changes during early warming.",

Apart from supporting an important role of CAT in the host response, these data contrast with the present study, where we found increases in host SOD and GSx as well as CAT activity in both coral species and, importantly, variations in the timing and magnitude of these antioxidant responses (Fig. 5) . In A. millepora the antioxidant cascade started with an early increase in host CAT, followed by symbiont SOD, whereas, for S. pistillata, an early response in symbiont CAT-like activity was succeeded by host GSx. In both cases, however, host CAT showed the greatest relative increase under thermal stress. Additionally, the earlier study found no evidence of symbiont antioxidant activity in corals under thermal stress [55] , again contrasting with our findings, which showed significant increases in symbiont SOD and CAT-like activity for A. millepora (hosting clade C3 symbionts) and symbiont SOD, GSx and CAT-like activity in clade C8a hosted by S. pistillata. One of the main differences between the symbiont antioxidant responses was the increase of GSx in the symbionts of S. pistillata, but not in A. millepora. Processes downstream from SOD, such as the glutathione system, have been shown to differ in activity between the most tolerant and susceptible types of Symbiodinium, despite similar responses in SOD activity [61] , suggesting that the symbionts of S. pistillata could be more thermally tolerant, as indicated by the later bleaching response. Taken together, the difference in timing of bleaching and symbiont antioxidant response in our study could indicate either differences in host-driven defences or an important role of cladedependent thermal-induced malfunction.",

If, however, the symbiont represented a significant diffusive source of H 2 O 2 , it could be argued that an equal or greater antioxidant response would be expected in the symbiont, which was not the case here. In fact, under thermal stress, CAT activity was higher in the host than the symbiont, a response also shown previously [55, 63, 64] , suggesting that the host's scavenging capacity is likely capable of suppressing any symbiont-derived H 2 O 2 . However, a recent study showed that symbiont gene expression rarely exceeds a two-fold change [65] , and therefore it cannot be ruled out that the symbiont has a limited capacity to upregulate its antioxidants, thus explaining the lower response measured. Nevertheless, if photo-oxidative stress in the symbiont is the primary event in the bleaching cascade, as previously suggested [6, 51] , it could also be assumed that a decline in photosynthetic function would be visible initially in the symbiont prior to significant antioxidant upregulation and expulsion, a result our data do not support. Therefore, while verifying an increase in oxidative pressure during thermal stress, our results, along with an increasing pool of similar studies, are not congruent with the idea of accumulation of symbiont-derived free radicals as the initial cause of bleaching [55, 66] and instead suggest speciesspecific differences, where the initial pathophysiological response is largely independent of symbiont photosynthetic dysfunction.",

This secondary response could indeed be explained by the oxidative theory of coral bleaching, whereby increased ROS production by the symbiont, from photosystem failure, results in H 2 O 2 leaching into the host, and in this case, causes a boost in the antioxidants for H O 2 removal. As such, while our study reveals differences in the timing and magnitude of the antioxidant response for both species, the parallels in this late stage response support previous findings of a connection between symbiont stress and host antioxidant regulation [30, 55] . The delay in this response (days after the onset of symbiont expulsion), however, highlights the potential inaccuracy with using symbiont photosystem health as a proxy for the onset of thermal bleaching, and suggests that studies focussed solely on this trait as a cue for bleaching have potentially biased our understanding of coral bleaching towards mechanisms that are mainly active during the more severe stage of the bleaching process.",

However, given the sustained production of DMSP in A. millepora even after substantial loss of symbionts, it is more likely due to the additional contribution of DMSP by the animal host in A. millepora, as previously shown by Raina et al. [26] , or by the associated microbial community [26, 27] . In contrast, the decline in DMSP concentration with cell loss in S. pistillata indicates that DMSP production might only be Symbiodinium derived in this species. Taking into account these differences, it is evident that the role of DMSP is not equal in the two species of corals and therefore should be evaluated on a species-specific basis.",

Indeed, previous studies have linked increases in DMSO, the oxidation product of DMSP, to enhanced protection from oxidative stress in corals [54] . If DMSP production in S. pistillata is solely Symbiodinium derived, then the observed increase in DMSP and DMSO per Symbiodinium cell under thermal stress would corroborate its role as an antioxidant in the symbionts. However, in the case of A. millepora, the story is not as clearwhile DMSP concentrations increased with increasing host SOD (suggesting a link with oxidative stress), the lack of subsequent changes over time suggests that DMSP production is not directly related to the absolute level of ROS pressure, but is rather switched on at a certain degree of stress and maintained for the duration of that stress. This lack of connection between DMSP concentration and relative ROS pressure is further supported by the lack of accumulation of DMSO, which would be expected if DMSP was oxidised at a significant rate. Because of its strong response in A. millepora, we propose that DMSP is a useful early biomarker of thermal (and other types of physiological) stress, with the potential to apply this trait more broadly to the Acropora genus.",

We identified a cascade of pathophysiological responses that were common to both taxa, and delivered an overview of the time-dependent key processes that occur during coral bleaching. We were able to ascertain that susceptibility to bleaching is independent of photosynthetic performance and that antioxidant activity precedes symbiont photoinhibition in these two species of coral. Our time-resolved study of multiple traits allowed us to identify a potential late stage interaction between symbiont and host oxidative stress in both corals, which may capture the hypothesised leaching of H 2 O 2 from a compromised symbiont to an already thermally stressed host. Yet, given the lagtime between symbiont loss, combined host-symbiont antioxidant response and symbiont photosynthetic dysfunction, it seems likely that this late-stage response is uncoupled from the initiation of the bleaching process. We revealed that the timing and magnitude of the antioxidant and DMSP response to elevated temperatures varied between the two species, suggestive of unique strategies for acclimating to thermal anomalies, underlining the potential importance of maternal provisioning, host species and symbiont type in bleaching susceptibility.

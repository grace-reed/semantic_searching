Mass coral bleaching events are correlated with increased sea-surface temperatures, however, the cellular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is uncertain. To determine if oxidative stress plays a mechanistic role in the process of sea-surface temperature-related coral bleaching, we examined corals along a depth transect in the Florida Keys over a single season that was characterized by unusually high sea-surface temperatures. We observed strong positive correlations between accumulation of oxidative damage products and bleaching in corals over a year of sampling. High levels of antioxidant enzymes and small heat-shock proteins were negatively correlated with levels of oxidative damage products. Corals that experienced oxidative stress had higher chaperonin levels and protein turnover activity. Our results indicate that coral bleaching is tightly coupled to the antioxidant and cellular stress capacity of the symbiotic coral, supporting the mechanistic model that coral bleaching (zooxanthellae loss) may be a final strategy to defend corals from oxidative stress.",

Over the past 30 years, coral reefs have experienced extensive degradation worldwide [2] . One etiology for this global degradation is a syndrome known as coral bleaching, a process whereby corals lose their algal symbiont or the symbiont's photosynthetic pigments degrade [3, 4] . Coral bleaching can be induced by diverse factors, including high temperature, cold temperature, supersaturating light, and bacterial infection.

                "text": "Many environmental factors associated with mass bleaching events can concomitantly induce increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an antioxidant response, and significant oxidative damage to symbiotic coral [3] [4] [5] . Early studies conducted in symbiotic anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima) demonstrated an increased antioxidant enzymatic capacity in response to hyperbaric oxygen conditions as a result of increased oxygen production from its endosymbiotic algae [6] . Additional experiments led several workers to conclude that an increase in ROS production in A. elegantissima was mainly derived from light-dependent processes, such as photosynthesis [7] . Recent work from our laboratory demonstrated that there is a significant increase in oxidative damage products in coral as a result of a hightemperature and light interaction, further corroborating the conclusions of several groups [5, [7] [8] [9] . One proposed model concerning a possible mechanism of coral bleaching is based on the responses to oxidative stress by both components of the symbiotic relationship [5] . Stressors such as heat stress, osmolarity, high light, and ultraviolet radiation can destabilize the photosynthetic electron-transport chain resulting in increased production rates of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [10 -13] . Production of ROS occurs in the chloroplast by several mechanisms associated with Photosystem I-and Photosystem II-catalyzed electron transfer, the most notable being the Mehler reaction and generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) by the Oxygen-Evolving Complex [12] [13] [14] [15] . It is proposed that algal-generated H O 2 can diffuse from the algal symbiont into the coral cytoplasm ( Fig. 1) . Once inside the coral cytosol, H 2 O 2 can be either 'neutralized' by enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant pathways or it can converted into a more noxious ROS, the hydroxyl radical, either by Fenton or Haber-Weiss chemistry [10] . Below some ROS concentration threshold, the antioxidant defenses of the coral can compensate and ameliorate the destructive capacity of these ROS. Above this threshold, ROS will cause oxidative damage. At some intensity of oxidative damage, corals will eradicate the dominant source of ROS production by expelling their endosymbiotic algae. Thus, the Oxidative Theory of Coral Bleaching proposes that bleaching is a coral's final defense against oxidative stress ( Fig. 1) .",

More importantly, there is an absence of cellular-based mechanistic models concerning oxidative stress and coral bleaching that could be tested in both the laboratory and in the field. Based on early work in anemones and laboratory work on corals, we propose a model of oxidative-stress driven coral bleaching [5] . High-temperature destabilization of Photosystem II occurs, in part, by the impairment of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) [21] [22] [23] . One mechanism of OEC impairment is associated with the release of Mn 2\u03e9 and Cl \u03ea from OEC and the dissociation of proteins OEC18, OEC24, and Photosystem II-associated heme catalase [24 -27] . As a result, the rate of hydrogen peroxide generation increases by orders of magnitude [25] . Heat stress can further exacerbate the potential for hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative stress through the deactivation of a number of hydrogen peroxide-neutralizing pathways, allowing for concentrations to increase [28 -30] . Diffusion of hydrogen peroxide out of the chloroplast and into other dinoflagellate organelles and the cnidarian cytoplasm can result in oxidative damage through the entire symbiotic organism, especially in organelles that contain high iron content or are associated with production of superoxide (e.g., mitochondria) [10] . In response to this oxidative stress, the coral expels the dinoflagellate, resulting in the phenomenon observed as coral bleaching.",

Furthermore, higher levels of antioxidant components (e.g., ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase) in one individual should be associated with a different threshold or occurrence for bleaching compared to an individual that has lower levels of these antioxidant components [10] .

Temperatures at all sites exceeded 28\u00b0C from June-September, and peaked in July, when temperatures at the two deepest sites reached or exceeded 30\u00b0C. By September, all colonies at the 18 m site exhibited extensive bleaching, and colonies at the 9 m site either were partially bleached or had moderate paling. In contrast, corals at the 3 m site did not exhibit any visual symptoms of bleaching (Fig.  2b) . The bleached or nonbleached appearance of colonies was related to July ocean temperature (logistic regression, 2 \u03ed 21.0, p \u03fd .0001; r 2 \u03ed 0.76). The extent of bleaching was quantified using chlorophyll a concentration, which was negatively correlated with ocean temperature (r \u03ed \u03ea0.53, n e \u03ed 23.6, p \u03fd .01). Temperatures at all sites remained above 28\u00b0C until October, when water temperature decreased over a 2 week period to less than 25\u00b0C in the 3-9 m sites, and below 27\u00b0C at the 18 m site. By October, colonies at all depths darkened in color and increased in chlorophyll a content indicating recovery from bleaching ( Fig. 2c ). Hence, coral bleaching was not a universal occurrence at high sea-surface temperatures, but was positively associated with depth.",

To test whether oxidative damage is associated with and precedes coral bleaching we examined levels of protein carbonyl and lipid peroxidation (LPO), both of which reflect aspects of cellular oxidative damage.

Levels of Mn SOD and Cu/Zn SOD were significantly positively correlated (r \u03ed 0.75, n e \u03ed 77.6, p \u03fd .0001). From March to October, mean accumulations of Mn SOD and Cu/Zn SOD were negatively correlated with variances in carbonyl (\u03ea0.70 \u0545 r \u0545 \u03ea0.52; all p \u03fd .02, n \u03ed 20). Furthermore, between June and September levels of both Cu/Zn SOD and Mn SOD were positively correlated with chlorophyll a content (r \u03ed 0.33, n e \u03ed 50.9, p \u04f6 .05; r \u03ed 0.38, n e \u03ed 97.2, p \u04f6 .05, respectively). Both of these analyses strongly suggest that superoxide dismutases are significant components of the antioxidant capacity of corals and that these two proteins may play an important role in preventing the process of coral bleaching.",

                "text": "The chloroplast sHsp is evolutionarily conserved and usually is only present in response to a stressed condition [44] . This protein specifically associates with the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II and protects this enzyme's function during heat stress, high-light stress, ultraviolet-light exposure, and oxidative stress, most likely via a recycling antioxidant mechanism [43, 45] . Measurement of the chloroplast sHsp is relevant for two reasons: (i) photo-oxidative damage to photosystem II within the zooxanthellae has been implicated in heatstress-mediated bleaching and (ii) photosystem II is a primary generator of hydrogen peroxide as a result of a degenerating efficiency of the oxygen-evolving complex in hydrolyzing water to diatomic oxygen [15, 28, 30, 46, 47] . Chloroplast sHsps were barely detectable in corals at all depths in March, but increased dramatically in May [Welch ANOVA, F (1,19. 3) \u03ed 54.6, p \u03fd .001; Fig. 6A ]. Levels of this protein were greatest in corals at 3 m and decreased with depth, a pattern that remained consistent throughout the year. Chloroplast sHsp levels were negatively correlated with protein carbonyl (r \u03ed \u03ea0.55, n e \u03ed 72.6, p \u03fd .0001) and LPO (r \u03ed \u03ea0.38, n e \u03ed 113.4, p \u03fd .001) levels during May-September, when ocean waters were warmest. Hence, during heat stress, increased chloroplast sHsp concentrations may have protected zooxanthellae by preventing increased production of ROS. More importantly, the negative correlation between accumulation of chloroplast sHsp and oxidative damage products suggests that Photosystem II may be the principal component responsible for generating the oxidative stress associated with bleaching.",

For example, different species of coral have different temperature thresholds for coral bleaching [53, 54] . Furthermore, there is significant variation among individuals of the same species in their threshold of bleaching. This variation is correlated with components of cellular defense against stress, indicating that these molecular/cellular processes could be the focal point for such variation. The argument that bleaching susceptibility has a genetic component is further supported by studies demonstrating strong correlations between specific genotypic clades of dinoflagellates and incidence of bleaching [55] .",

For example, we only measured levels of Cu/Zn SOD and Mn SOD in the cnidarian. Concentrations and activity of these enzymes in the dinoflagellate, as well as FeSOD, need to be investigated. Oxidative defensive mechanisms that specifically protect photosynthesis, such as aspects of the Photosystem IIassociated heme catalase and the xanthophyll cycle, should also be examined and characterized. Mechanisms and pathways other than those of the classical antioxidant defenses should be examined to determine if these are significant processes that mitigate coral bleaching. For example, there are several ORFs in the dinoflagellate chloroplast genome that show significant homology of the psbA gene of the D1 protein of photosystem II [56] . In Synechocystis, differential induction of the psbA genes are associated with tolerance against conditions that induce photoinhibition and production of ROS [36, 57, 58] . Preliminary evidence from a heat-stressed subtractive library of dinoflagellates obtained from the coral Montastraea annularis indicates differential induction of psbA transcript homologues, suggesting that a similar mechanism of protection may exist in coral dinoflagellates (Downs, C., Markus, E., Vetter, L, unpublished results). Other adaptations to stress, such as changes in lipid composition of key organellar membranes, induction of scleractinian sHsps, and shifts in metabolic pathways, need to be investigated so that their relative contribution and role in coral stress tolerance can be determined.",

There are a number of observations both from the laboratory and the field documenting recovery from a bleaching event [2, 3] . One hypothesis for this phenomenon, especially given the data supporting the Oxidative Theory of Coral Bleaching, is that the outcome for either mortality or recovery is determined by the extent of oxidative damage experienced by the coral. Irreparable damage to essential cellular structures, such as chromosomes and mitochondria, by ROS can initiate the development of apoptotic or necrotic processes [10] . Minor damage can be repaired and the coral recover, as suggested by the increase in chaperone and protein turnover activity (Figs. 3 and 4) . Such a hypothesis can be easily tested, both in the laboratory and in the field, using many of the methodologies and techniques first developed in mammalian studies of ROS-toxicity and pathologies [10] .",

Many corals, especially the reef building coral species, are long-lived (ca. 200 -800 years old). Climatic/oceanic events associated with mass-coral bleachings are argued to have increased in frequency and intensity over the past years in contrast to what has occurred in the last 450 -6000 years [2, 59] . Some of these events, especially El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, result in increased seasurface temperatures that are oftentimes at or above coral bleaching thresholds [3] . By extrapolating some of the tenets of the Free Radical Theory of Aging to coral biology, it can be hypothesized that chronic or repeated exposures to conditions conducive to oxidative stress may decrease the overall condition of coral [60] . For example, a decrease in the fitness of the individual or its offspring may result from a decrease in the overall genomic integrity that is usually associated with oxidative stress [10, 60] . Such a decline could be further detected as an increase in mutation rate, decline in the stress-protein response, or a decline in enzymatic activity necessary for homeostasis [61] . It has been suggested that many cnidarian species are 'immortal' or lack the deteriorative process associated with senescence [62] . In light of the findings presented here and in the literature, increased significance must be given to the question: are oxidants a determinant of the maximum life span and condition of corals, thereby influencing coral reef ecology?",

Chaperonins Hsp60 and Hsp70 increased significantly at all sites in May compared to March (ANOVA, both F \u03fe 32.1, p \u03fd .0001; Figs. 5A and 5B). From May-September, Hsp60 levels were significantly lower in corals at the 3 m site compared to corals at all other sites, except the 6 m site in July-August, which was equivalent [one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer HSD Test: all F(3,16) \u03fd 5.93, p \u03fd .01]. Levels of Hsp70 showed a similar pattern from March-July,Fig. 2. (A) Seasonal variation in ocean temperatures recorded beside coral (Montastraea annularis) colonies at four depths. Bars show depth of colonies: black \u03ed 3 m, gray \u03ed 6 m, red \u03ed 9 m, blue \u03ed 18 m.

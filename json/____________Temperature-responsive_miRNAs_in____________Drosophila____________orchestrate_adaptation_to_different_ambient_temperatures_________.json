In fact, specialized histones were found to play a crucial role in in the perception of temperature (Kumar and Wigge 2010) . However, despite these fascinating insights, our knowledge about the underlying mechanisms that trigger adaptation on the transcriptomic level is still far from being complete. Over the past decade, small non-coding (snc-) RNAs have emerged as important regulators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in virtually all eukaryotic organisms (Wilson and Doudna 2013) . Linking temperature-dependent gene regulation with epigenetic mechanisms i.e. the newly arising small RNA world, temperature-responsive micro (mi-) RNAs have been proposed as putative drivers of gene expression changes in Arabidopsis (May et al. 2013) . However, in animals, these links remain very poorly understood and studies are still fragmentary (Bizuayehu et al. 2015) .",

All probes show distinct peaks at 22 nt and 25-26 nt corresponding to the typical size of mi-/siRNAs and piRNAs, respectively. Remarkably, while replicates of one probe exhibit nearly identical length profiles, probes obtained from high-temperature housed flies clearly differ from those of low-temperature housed flies in that they exhibit a stronger 22 nt peak in relation to the 25-26 nt peak ( Figure 1B ).",

                "text": "Considering the fact that high-temperature housing results in an increased abundance of miRNA reads compared to piRNA reads, we checked whether this is caused by a general upregulation of miRNAs or whether alternatively distinct miRNAs behave differently upon changes in temperature. We therefore analyzed the expression of individual miRNAs and screened for expression changes that are consistent with changes in housing temperature. We found that 195 different miRNAs (including iso-miRs), accounting for 35-40% of all miRNA reads in the different probes, exhibit temperature dependent expression profiles ( Figure 1D ). In order to focus on biological relevant expression changes, we rejected miRNAs with less than 1.1-fold expression change, finally retaining 129 temperature-responsive miRNAs (Supplemental Figure S2A , Supplemental Table S2 ). Since small RNAseq data can only give information on the relative abundance of a small RNA, we performed additional real-time (RT) quantitative PCR experiments on selected miRNAs which verify absolute expression changes, although the changes for miR-989-3p and miR-7-5p are rather moderate (Figure 3 ). Interestingly, temperature-responsive miRNAs can be categorized into those that show higher abundance at Hyper-Optimal housing Temperature (HOT=29\u00b0C, n=25, in the following referred to as HOT-miRNAs) and those that show higher abundance at Near-Optimal housing Temperature (NOT=18\u00b0C, n=104, in the following referred to as NOT-miRNAs, the prefixes HOT-and NOT-will be used analogously for piRNAs, genes and transcripts in the following). This heterogeneous picture suggests that temperature does not primarily affect elementary factors of the miRNA pathway, such as Dcr-1 or AGO1, and thus miRNA biogenesis per se, but more We next wanted to know, if similar patterns can be observed for the piRNA fraction. Since piRNA pools are highly diverse, comprising tens of thousands of individual sequences, we grouped piRNAs according to their transposon targets and checked whether the expression of piRNAs that match to a specific transposon differs significantly when comparing high-and low-temperature housing. Indeed, expression of most transposon-derived piRNAs (57-60% of transposon-derived piRNA reads) changes in a temperature-dependent manner ( Figure 1E ), although the magnitude of change lags behind those observed for miRNAs (Supplemental Figure S2B) . As is the case for miRNAs, expression of distinct sub-fractions of piRNAs changes contrarily with piRNA groups being consistently up-regulated, or consistently down- Figure S1 ). Furthermore, the overall ratio of sense-and antisense-piRNAs and the amount of 1U/10A reads remains virtually unaffected (Supplemental Figure S1 ). To check if altered expression of specific transposons can explain the modified piRNA target repertoire we performed RNA-seq, probing ovaries of flies housed at 18\u00b0C and 29\u00b0C after hatching. Considering the entire transposon repertoire, we did not detect a correlation between transposon expression and the expression of corresponding piRNAs. Thus, we focused on transposons, whose expression changes significantly in a temperature-dependent manner. We found that the expression of 27 individual transposons (significantly) depends on temperature and our results confirm previous observations on heat-induced transcriptional activation of Copia elements (Strand and McDonald, 1985) . Moreover, piRNAs derived from transposons with higher expression at 29\u00b0C tend to exhibit higher abundance at 29\u00b0C while the opposite is true for piRNAs derived from transposons with higher expression at 18\u00b0C (Supplemental Table S3 ). However, the difference between these groups does not reach significance (\u03c7 2 =2.27, p=0.13) and transposon/piRNA pairs that contradict the overall trend are present, implying that altered transposon activity cannot fully explain the altered piRNA target repertoire.",

                "text": "We performed Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment analysis for HOT-and NOT-genes separately and found that the two groups are enriched for genes involved in different biological processes ( Figure 3 ). HOTgenes are enriched for genes involved in transcription and chromatin organization and downregulation of these genes at 18\u00b0C might compensate for reduced chromatin accessibility at low temperatures (Chereji et al. 2016 ). On the other side, genes with higher expression at 18\u00b0C are enriched for genes involved in oogenesis and lipid metabolism, where the latter might reflect the need for increased energy release at low We next turned to the question, in what way temperature-responsive miRNAs may contribute to the observed gene expression changes and predicted target sites for temperature-responsive miRNAs using miRanda (John et al. 2004) . In a first attempt, we separately analyzed the expression of all transcripts that represent putative targets for a specific temperature-responsive miRNA. Applying this rather plain approach, we detected no significantly altered expression for the predicted target genes as a whole comparing high and low temperature conditions. However, since transcripts typically comprise multiple putative miRNA binding sites, we next focused on the expression of those transcripts that are potentially targeted by either HOT-or NOT-miRNAs but not both. Indeed, we detected a significant (\u03c7 =7.98, p=0.0047) difference between these two groups of transcripts. Remarkably, transcripts targeted exclusively by NOT-miRNAs tend to exhibit higher expression at 29\u00b0C, while transcripts targeted exclusively by HOT-miRNAs tend to exhibit higher expression at 18\u00b0C ( Figure 4A ). This fact is also clearly reflected by the summed up rpm and fpkm counts for transcripts of these two groups at different temperatures ( Figure 4B ).",

In line with the above-mentioned finding, the ratio of NOT-to-HOT miRNA target sites is higher for genes that show higher expression at 29\u00b0C compared to genes that show higher expression at 18\u00b0C. Noteworthy, this relation did not change when we modified the free energy thresholds for putative miRNA binding sites ( Figure 4C ). To be more specific, we analyzed the expression and miRNA targeting of Vm26Ab (FBgn0003980) and Cp15 (FBgn0000355) in more detail ( Figure 4D ). Vm26Ab is critical for eggshell formation and egg activation (Sch\u00fcpbach and Wieschaus 1991 , Tadros et al. 2003 , Wu et al. 2010 . Protein Cp15 is part of the oocyte-surrounding chorion (Waring and Mahowald, 1979) . Transcripts of both genes are among the most abundant temperature-responsive transcripts in the Drosophila ovary. Vm26Ab has a strong predicted target site for a HOT-miRNA, namely an isoform of miR-34 with more than 2.4-fold abundance at 29\u00b0C compared to 18\u00b0C. In line with this, the expression of Vm26Ab is reduced by 25% at 29\u00b0C compared to 18\u00b0C ( Figure   4D ). Cp15 has binding sites for three different NOT-miRNAs, miR-306-5p and isoforms of miR-965 and miR-31b. As is the case for Vm26Ab and miR-34, expression levels of Cp15 and its targeting miRNAs correlate inversely (miR-965 and miR-31b not shown). Together, these results strongly suggest that temperature-dependent expression changes of specific genes that are critically involved in the reproduction process are at least in part directed by altered expression of temperature-responsive miRNAs.",

However, the mRNA level of LOQS, a doublestranded RNA binding protein that together with DCR-1 is involved in pre-miRNA processing Based on this observation, we checked whether we could detect a higher amount of ping-pong amplification under 29\u00b0C conditions, which would be mirrored by a more pronounced ping-pong signature. Since ping-pong scores increase non-linearly with growing sequencing depth, we initially had to resample each sequence dataset to simulate equal sequencing depth. We then calculated ping-pong scores for 100 pseudo-replicate datasets per original dataset (18\u00b0C #1, 18\u00b0C #2, 29\u00b0C #1, 29\u00b0C #2, two replicates each, Figure 4f ). Remarkably and in line with the observation that Aub and Ago3 are upregulated under 29\u00b0C conditions, piRNAs produce a more pronounced ping-pong signature when flies were housed at 29\u00b0C directly after hatching, compared to 18\u00b0C (Figure 4F, left) . In consistency with this, ping-pong signatures become more pronounced upon 18\u00b0C-to-29\u00b0C switch ( Figure 4F , middle) while becoming less pronounced upon 29\u00b0C-to-18\u00b0C switch (Figure 4f, right) . In addition to upregulation of Aub and Ago3, higher ping-pong rates may also result from temperature-related effects on RNA secondary structure.",

                "text": "RNA secondary structure is known to be a major determinant of si-and miRNAi efficiency (Shao et ). To gain support for these hypotheses, we made the following consideration: Assuming higher expression of a few transposons to be responsible for the increased ping-pong rates, we would expect that the transposon composition of pingpong piRNAs changes accordingly. Alternatively, if upregulation of Aub and Ago3, and/or a lesser degree of RNA secondary structure represent the main factors that drive ping-pong amplification, we would expect all transposon families to produce more ping-pong piRNAs, which would not result in an altered transposon composition. Therefore, we analyzed the transposon composition of ping-pong piRNAs at different temperatures and found no evidence that piRNAs from any transposon family are over-or underrepresented in the fraction of ping-pong piRNAs at 18\u00b0C or 29\u00b0C, respectively (Supplemental Table   S7 ). We further checked ping-pong rates at loci with a minimum average ping pong pair count of 1 (n=37439), 5 (n=14429), 10 (n=9763), 50 (n=3221) and 100 (n=1810, based on bootstrap pseudo-replicate datasets) and found that more loci show increased ping-pong rates at 29\u00b0C compared to 18\u00b0C (Supplemental Table S7 ). Hence, we propose that heat-induced unfolding of secondary structures may expose formerly inaccessible target sites, thus explaining the more efficient ping-pong amplification which is in addition facilitated by concurrent upregulation of Aub and Ago3. Assuming that a shift from 18\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C not equally exposes all putative piRNA targets, having a smaller effect on very stable or already unfolded targets, altered RNA secondary structures could provide a plausible explanation for the slightly modified target repertoire of piRNAs ( Figure 1E and Supplemental Figure S2B ) which cannot be fully explained by altered transposon activity. In summary, these results demonstrate that higher temperatures induce an overall decrease of piRNAs, possibly in connection with downregulation of Yb, Shu and HSP83. At the same time, in line with upregulation of Aub and Ago3 and the assumption that increasing temperature leads to more accessible RNA secondary structures, the fraction of secondary piRNAs within the total piRNA population increases which results in more pronounced ping-pong signatures under 29\u00b0C conditions.",

Focusing on the Drosophila female germline, this study provides evidence for a link between temperature-dependent gene expression and small RNA populations that considerably change along thermal gradients. We further argue that the overall pattern of differentially expressed miRNAs and genes mirrors important functional adaptations. Generally, the present study emphasizes the enormous influence that abiotic factors such as temperature can exert on regulatory networks involving epigenetic mechanisms mediated by sncRNA and mRNAs. This might be of special importance considering assays applying heatshock induced conditional knockouts. Lastly, we believe that it is worth keeping in mind these temperature-related phenomena when studying functional aspects of small RNA pathways in particular, considering the fact that these systems did not evolve under 25\u00b0C laboratory conditions. Otherwise, we ",

We then removed the adult flies and allowed the eggs to continue developing at 25\u00b0C. Adult female flies were collected not later than 5 hours after hatching of the first adult fly to ensure same age and virginity of the collected individuals. The collected female flies were split into two groups (~150 individuals each) and transferred to new culture tubes that were kept at 18\u00b0C and 29\u00b0C respectively. Since the speed of development is subject to temperature, we sampled ovaries from 29\u00b0C flies after 48 hours and ovaries from 18\u00b0C flies after 120 hours to ensure that both groups had reached identical developmental stages (Ashburner et al. 2011) . For each probe, we pooled ovaries from 40 individuals. We refer to these probes as 18\u00b0C #1 and 29\u00b0C #1. After the first sampling procedure, we switched the temperature for the remaining flies from 18\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C and from 29\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C, respectively. A second sampling procedure was performed after further 48 hours for flies now kept at 29\u00b0C and after 120 hours for flies now kept at 18\u00b0C; that is, flies in both populations reached the age of 168 hours. We refer to the probes of the second sampling procedure as 18\u00b0C #2 and 29\u00b0C #2. The whole procedure was conducted twice in order to obtain two independent biological replicates (referred to as a and b) for each probe. using the Agilent DNA 1000 Kit.

In order to identify miRNAs whose expression depends on housing temperature, we screened our probes for miRNAs that showed consistently higher expression under high-temperature, or under lowtemperature conditions. Instead of applying the General Linear Model (GLM) as we did for gene expression analysis, we conducted a more conservative customized procedure to make sure that a mi-/piRNA in question shows consistent up-or downregulation in all pairwise comparisons, which is not the case when applying the GLM. Therefore, we defined HOT-miRNAs as miRNAs that are significantly enriched in the miRNA pools of flies kept at 29\u00b0C after hatching compared to miRNA pools of flies kept at 18\u00b0C after hatching. Further, the abundance of HOT-miRNAs had to increase significantly upon 18\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C switch, and had to decrease significantly upon 29\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C switch. Accordingly, NOT-miRNAs were defined as those miRNAs that behave contrarily. To test for compliance with each of these three requirements, we compared individual miRNA expression rates performing the following pairwise probe comparisons: 18\u00b0C #1 vs. 29\u00b0C #1, 18\u00b0C #1 vs. 29\u00b0C #2 and 29\u00b0C #1 vs. 18\u00b0C #2. Since we used both biological replicates of each probe independently, twelve pairwise comparisons were performed in total, all of which had to reveal a consistent tendency. For each comparison, we calculated distribution. A similar procedure was applied to piRNAs, with the difference that we did not examine single piRNA molecules, but rather groups of piRNAs that match to identical transposons.",

To compare ping-pong signatures across datasets with different sequencing depth we performed a bootstrapping procedure focusing on reads that could not be annotated as any other small ncRNA, thus presumably representing the piRNA fraction. We built 100 pseudo-replicate datasets per original dataset, each comprising one million sequence reads resulting in a comparable sequence diversity.

Worth mentioning, reports on activation of Drosophila transposons at high temperature exist, though they yield no consistent overall picture (Garc\u00eda Guerreiro 2012). In order to analyze a possible enrichment for specific transposon classes within the pool of HOT-or NOT-piRNAs, we grouped piRNAs matching to individual transposons according to major transposon classes into LINE-, LTR-, DNA-and other elements. However, we did not detect significant changes in either transposon composition or the total amount of transposon-derived piRNAs that correlate with changes in housing temperature when applying this general classification (Supplemental",

However, whether upregulation of LOQS contributes to the dominance of miRNAs under 29\u00b0C conditions in consideration of unchanged DCR-1 and AGO1 expression remains disputable based on the available data. What is more, experiments using loqs knock-out flies suggest that only a subset of miRNAs depend on LOQS(Liu et al. 2007), but importantly this subset does not correspond to those miRNAs that are more abundant under 29\u00b0C conditions, where LOQS shows higher expression levels.Regarding piRNA pathway factors, we found that the mRNA level of Zucchini, the endonuclease thatproduces primary piRNAs (Ipsaro et al. 2012, Nishimasu et al. 2012), is tendentially upregulated under 29\u00b0C conditions. Further, Armitage, a Piwi binding factor that is required for piRNA loading and correct localization of Piwi into Yb bodies (Saito et al. 2010) is significantly upregulated on the mRNA level at 29\u00b0C. At first glance, this finding is surprising in the light of reduced overall piRNA abundance in 29\u00b0Choused flies. However, we further noticed significant downregulation of the mRNAs of Shutdown (Shu) and HSP83, two factors that are crucial for loading of piRNAs onto PIWI-proteins and shu-knockdown results in drastic reduction of both, primary and secondary piRNAs(Preall et al. 2012). In addition, Yb, the eponymous factor for Yb bodies, which is crucial for piRNA loading onto Piwi (Saito et al 2010), tends to be downregulated on the mRNA level. Assuming that unloaded piRNAs are rapidly degraded, the expression levels of Yb, Shu and HSP83 could represent a limiting factor for total piRNA population size.This would provide a plausible explanation for the reduced overall piRNA abundance in 29\u00b0C housed flies.High temperature housing results in increased ping-pong ratesInterestingly and in contrast to Yb, Shu and HSP83, Aub and Ago3 are significantly upregulated in 29\u00b0C housed flies. Aub and Ago3 represent the two PIWI-proteins that participate in the ping-pong amplification loop and thus are essential for secondary piRNA biogenesis(Czech and Hannon 2016).",

The small RNA fraction ranging from approximately 15 nt to 40 nt was excised from the gel and resolved in 30 \u03bc l nuclease-free water using Ultrafree-MC and Ultra-0.5 3K centrifugal devices (Amicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and integrity was tested with Agilent's 2100 Bioanalyzer system using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit. NanoDrop 2000 system (Thermo Scientific) was used to quantify inorganic ions and test for polycarbonate contamination. Adaptor ligation was performed using Illumina's TruSeq Small RNA Sample Pre Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA with ligated adaptors was subject to reverse transcription using Invitrogen's Super Script II Kit. The resulting cDNA was PCR-amplified according to the following thermal cycling profile: 30\u2032' at 98\u00b0C, [10\u2032\u2032 at 98\u00b0C, 30\u2032\u2032 at 60\u00b0C, 15\u2032\u2032 at 72\u00b0C] \u00d7 11, 10\u2032 at 72\u00b0C. DNA concentration of the libraries was tested with Agilent's 2100 Bioanalyzer system",

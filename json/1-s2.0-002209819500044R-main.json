There was a net daily uptake of ammonium from natural seawater, which was modulated according to nutritional history, light history, ammonium concentration, and possible biological rhythmicity. Zooxanthellae also assimilated nitrogen excreted by host tissues, including 15N absorbed from ingested alga. Nearly 100% of the 15N subsequently released from zooxanthellae was incorporated in host tissues, with no significant loss from the clam over at least 10 days. Zooxanthellae therefore conserve and recycle essentially all nitrogenous end-products within T. gigas, affording giant clams a nutritional advantage over non-symbiotic bivalves. In further contrast with heterotrophic bivalves from particle-rich environments, T. gigas show longer gut passage times and high net and gross efficiencies (78.1 -+ 9.4% and 99.2 i-0.4%, respectively) with which organic nitrogen is absorbed from ingested particles. Filter-feeding and/or other non-autotrophic processes were essential as a source of nitrogen to maintain observed rates of juvenile growth, but declined in significance with increasing clam size. Even under cloudy conditions of limited irradiance, the total contribution of nitrogen acquired as ammonium by zooxanthellae exceeded the contribution from ingested particles in T. gigas larger than about 0.1 g, increasing to at least 45% of total nitrogen requirements in clams of 10 g.

What is certain is that endosymbiotic algae known as zooxanthellae within the hypertrophied siphon (commonly refered to as mantle tissue) transfer excess carbon from photosynthesis to host tissues, possibly in quantities that are sufficient to satisfy respiratory requirements in T. maxima (Trench et al., 1981) , T. gigus (Fisher et al., 1985; Klumpp et al., 1992) , T. tevoroa and T. derusa (Klumpp and Lucas, 1994) . Southgate (1988) has also demonstrated assimilation of 14C-labelled carbohydrate and lipid from microcapsules ingested by T. gigus larvae. And recently, we have also helped to dispel earlier doubts over the importance of filter-feeding (e.g. Ricard & Salvat, 1977) , showing that particulate organic matter satisfied at least 65% of the total carbon needed for both the respiration and growth in small T. gigas (Klumpp et al., 1992) . Given the additional potential for direct uptake of dissolved organic matter (DOM) (Fankboner, 1971; Goreau et al., 1973) , it is clear that T. gigus is trophically opportunistic,",

                "text": "Rather, research has focused on a further source of nutrition, establishing that giant clams may effect net uptake of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (Burris, 1983; Wilkerson & Trench, 1986; Fitt et al., 1993) , and that tissue growth is stimulated in response to the addition of nitrogen as ammonium or nitrate to surrounding seawater (Heslinga et al., 1990; Braley, 1992; Belda et al.. 1993) . It is generally accepted that net uptake of ammonium from the environment by intact zooxanthellae-host symbioses occurs by passive diffusion down concentration gradients that are created by localized substrate depletion (e.g. D'Elia et al., 1983) . Certainly, the haemolymph of T. gigus appears to be the immediate source of metabolites for zooxanthellae (Rees et al., 1993) which are able to assimilate ammonium for the synthesis of amino acids (Muscatine, 1980; Wilkerson & Muscatine, 1984; Summons et al., 1986; Anderson & Burris, 1987; Wilkerson & Trench, 1986) , and which occupy a unique tubular system that ramifies from a diverticulum of the stomach (Norton et al., 1992) . Further, the uptake of dissolved inorganic nitrogen by T. gigus is photodependent, and does not occur in isolated host tissues (Wilkerson & Trench, 1986; Fitt et al., 1993) . Therefore, the uptake of inorganic nitrogen by symbiotic associations appears at least partially dependent upon primary assimilation by zooxanthellae. It has been suggested that assimilation by zooxanthellae of ammonium-nitrogen excreted by the host, and the subsequent recycling of that nitrogen when released as amino acids utilized by host tissues, is central both to the rapid growth of tridacnid clams (Wilkerson & Trench, 1986; Lucas, 1994) and to the general success of algal-invertebrate symbioses in nutrient-poor waters (e.g. Muscatine & Porter, 1977; Spencer Davies, 1992) . However, there is little information on the fate of nitrogen assimilated by zooxanthellae (Griffiths & Streamer, 1988; Spencer Davies, 1992) . In addition, there is current debate on whether host waste nitrogenous products are freely available to algal symbionts (Douglas, 1988) and whether zooxanthellae are solely responsible for the assimilation of inorganic nutrients by the association. Having compared activities of both glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase with ammonium flux with and without metabolic inhibitors in the Hydra-Chlorellu symbiosis, Rees (1987) suggested that ammonium assimilation occurs primarily in the host tissues. It has also been proposed that this assimilation allows the host to regulate its population of symbionts by restricting their source of nitrogen, supplied as amino acids (McAuley, 1987; Rees, 1987) , and that host-mediated assimilation occurs in symbioses involving zooxanthellae (Miller & Yellowlees, 1989) . These suggestions obviously question the extent to which ammonium-nitrogen excreted by the host is freely available for assimilation and recycling by zooxanthellae (Douglas, 1988; Rees, 1991) .",

The respirometer was positioned immediately below the surface of seawater in the same open-air flow-through raceway to which clams had been acclimated. One clam of 11.5 to 12.1 (mean + 2 SE = 11.7 f 0.3) cm shell length was placed in each of the four respirometer chambers. Each chamber contained 2.5 1 of seawater, which was completely and automatically replaced by flushing at 90-min intervals throughout the 24 h of measurements. Net oxygen flux ( pmole . clam ' . h-') was determined by least-squares regression of PO, against the time between seawater flushings, and separate means computed for each of the 16 incubations undertaken per clam. To measure the average net ammonium flux ( pmole . clam ' . h-') for each clam during the same incubations, duplicate 15 ml seawater samples were collected by syringe through a 0.2 pm filter from rubber sampling ports. These samples were collected up to 3 min after flushing, and less than 5 min before the next water replacement. Control samples were collected in the same way from a beaker containing 2.5 seawater standing in the same raceway, replacing that seawater by hand at the times of respirometer flushing. All samples were frozen in capped polyethylene vials at -20\u00b0C which is known to stabilise ammonium concentrations (e.g. Degobbis, 1972) . Automated analyses of ammonium content were undertaken within 2 wk of sample collection as described by Ryle et al. (1981) . The sensitivity of these analyses was k-O.02 PM.

This was done by homogenising mantle and non-mantle tisssues separately, resuspending and centrifuging the pellet of zooxanthellae three times for each sample, using a whirlimixer to resuspend the pellet in filtered seawater, and discarding all supernatants. Microscopic observation then established no remaining \"contamination\" by host tissue, before pooling the pelleted zooxanthellae from each clam onto separate 4.7 cm GFC filters. We also excised the total soft tissues from a further four clams, and dried all samples to constant weight at low temperature (60\u00b0C) before storage in a desiccator. The total soft tissues were ground to a powder with mortar and pestle, and the protein contents both of zooxanthellae and total soft tissues determined according to Lowry et al. (1951) . Nitrogen equivalents were computed by dividing total protein by 5.8 (Gnaiger & Bitterlich, 1984) before calculating the average total nitrogen within zooxanthellae and host tissues (by difference) for these six clams. These average total nitrogen values were multiplied by individual measures of the fractional enrichment of r5N above natural background levels to give the enrichment (pg. clam-') of \"N within either the zooxanthellae or host tissues. It is worth emphasising two points here: (1) we were conservative in keeping only the purist fractions of host tissue or zooxanthellae for 15N analyses; and (2) the absolute enrichments of 15N within all zooxanthellae or all host tissues from each clam were calculated by multiplying the measured fraction of \"N in each sample by accurate measures of the total nitrogen in either the zooxanthellae or host tissues from other clams of similar size. By these means, each sample retained for 15N analysis did not depend on the complete separation of all zooxanthellae from all host tissues within each clam. Following the incubation of clams in ammonium-'5N chloride, to quantify the subsequent egestion of \"N in faeces, the six clams that had previously been particle-starved as described above were immediately transferred to shallow open-topped beakers submerged within the raceway of acclimation. All faeces produced by each clam were collected for filtration onto 2.5 cm GFC filters following intervals of 6, 24 and 48 h. The filters were dried to constant weight at 60\u00b0C and stored in a desiccator before analysing each sample both for total nitrogen content and the abundance of stable isotope \"N.",

Nitrogen contents of food and faeces were determined using an elemental combustion analyser (Carlo Erba 1108) with acetanilide standards. The above measures are of net absorption efficiencies, taking into account metabolic faecal losses that are secreted into but not reabsorbed from the gut (Hawkins & Bayne, 1992) . To measure the gross efficiency of absorption, which takes no account of metabolic faecal losses, as well as to measure approximate gut passage time, and to confirm the uptake by zooxanthellae of nitrogen absorbed across the hosts gut epithelium, a culture of the unicellular alga Zsochrysis galbana was homogenously labelled with '\"N as described by Hawkins & Bayne (1984) .

In addition both to that primary assimilation and to the uptake of endogenous protein-nitrogen excreted following the catabolism of host tissue, zooxanthellae assimilate ammonium deriving from deamination by the host tissues of exogenous protein-nitrogen that has recently been absorbed from ingested particulates (Fig. 6 ). Such assimilation was not included within our above measures of AZS, that were calculated as NAF in particle-fed clams during daylight plus EN measured in particle-starved clams during prolonged darkness. To estimate this additional uptake by zooxanthellae under natural conditions of particle availability, it is notable that efficiencies of nitrogen conversion [(net protein balance/protein absorption) X 1001 appear reasonably constant in nonsymbiotic shellfish, when about 12% of all protein-nitrogen absorbed in excess of Table   I Growth and metabohsm in four we classes of giant clam 7'. g,ga. to compare the relative utdisatlons of metabohsable mtrogen and carbon (refer Klumpp et al.. lY92) . and to illustrate the estimated relative contributions of ammomum-mlrogrn translocated from Tooxanthellae (AT) wsu mtrogen absorbed from mgested partxles (A) towards the total requirements CLAM DRY TISSUE WEIGHT (g) Fig. 7 . The estimated proportional contributions of (i) translocation from zooxanthellae of nitrogen assimilated as ammonium and (ii) absorption from filtered particles towards both the total nitrogen and the total carbon (data from Klumpp et al.. 1992) required for observed tissue growth and metabolism in T. @gas of different dry tissue weights. (Fig. 3) . Such uptake also required exposure to light (Figs. 1 and 2 ) (cf. Wilkerson & Trench, 1986) . Compared with net oxygen fluxes, net ammonium fluxes were not as dependent upon irradiance, so that net uptake continued well into the night, although declining to a state of net efflux (Fig. 2) . In addition, net uptake recommenced at least 1 h before first light, implying associated biological periodicity (Fig. 2) . The result was that we recorded significant net daily uptake of ammonium by T. gigas monitored over 24 h in natural unspiked seawater containing about 0.5 FM ammonium (Fig. 2) . Stimulation of net ammonium uptake in response to starvation, and the continuing net uptake of ammonium for several hours in darkness, both imply the compensatory filling of internal pools, as is consistent with passive diffusion down concentration gradients created by localized substrate depletion (refer Introduction). Zooxanthellae comprise 8% of the total protein content of the symbiosis (refer Results). Yet after 3 h incubation in ammonium-\"N chloride, more than 50% of the 15N retained by T. gigus was present in zooxanthellae (Fig. 4) ; and the mean (22 SE) atom% enrichment of lSN within zooxanthellae was 5.554 +-1.546%, compared with only 0.370 + 0.022% in host tissues. Given that some of the 15N in host tissues must have been 15N-ammonium within haemolymph, this suggests that zooxanthellae were responsible for most if not all primary assimilation of the 15N-labelled ammonium.",

                "text": "Certainly, it is well-established in anthozoan symbiosis systems that photosynthesis is required to provide the carbon skeletons for assimilation of inorganic nitrogen (Muscatine & D'Elia, 1978) . However, it should be remembered that the initial concentration (15 ,uM) of the present pulse of \"N-1abelled ammonium was well in excess of natural levels. Where host tissues do assimilate significant ammonium, as in the Hydra-Chlorellu symbiosis (Rees, 1987 (Rees, , 1991 and refer Introduction) , then the pathway effecting that assimilation is usually fully saturated (Spencer Davies, 1992) . Therefore, when a clam is exposed to high concentrations of ammonium, as in the present study, symbiotic algae will assimilate any ammonium not assimilated by hosts tissues. It follows that assimilation of ammonium by host tissues may be of proportionally greatest significance when there is little ammonium within the surrounding seawater. Our findings also establish the rapid direct uptake by zooxanthellae of nitrogen that had been absorbed by host tissues from ingested alga (Fig. 6) . Within 22 h of ingesting that alga, zooxanthellae contained [2.7 + (2.7 + 23.9)] X 100 = 10% of all the '\"N that had been absorbed by each clam (refer Results). Given that zooxanthellae comprise 8% of all protein in the T. gigas symbiosis, this again suggests unrestricted access by the zooxanthellae to nitrogen, which in this case was within amino acids and/or ammonium deriving from the hosts digestion and/or deamination of ingested nutrients. Griffiths & Streamer (1988) showed that the major early products of 14Cphotosynthesis in T. gigas include glucose, oligosaccharides and amino acids, and described how these products are each translocated from zooxanthellae to the host. Our findings suggest that most if not all the nitrogen within those amino acids had been first assimilated by zooxanthellae, rather than by host tissues. We have also shown that an average of 94.7 (83.8, 106.9)% of the \"N released by zooxanthellae was subsequently incorporated within host tissues (Fig. 4 , and refer Results). Carbon budgets suggest that the host receives a similar proportion of 90 to 95% of the carbon that is fixed daily by zooxanthellae (Fitt, 1993) . But perhaps most striking are present observations that enrichments by \"N in both the zooxanthellae and host tissues remained statistically unchanged from 22 h up until at least 189 h after ingesting 15N-labelled alga (Fig. 6) , and that the atom% \"N within total soft tissues of T. gigas remained statistically unchanged for at least 10 days after incubation in ammonium-'\"N chloride (refer Results). Therefore, collective findings indicate that zooxanthellae help to recycle and conserve close to 100% of all the nitrogenous end-products excreted by host tissues. Such impressive retentions could only be achieved if essentially all ammonium-I J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 190 (1995) 263-290 nitrogen excreted by the host is freely available for assimilation and recycling by the zooxanthellae in T. gigas. This is in obvious contrast to what has been proposed for the the Hydra-Chlorella symbiosis (McAuley, 1987; Rees, 1987 Rees, , 1991 and refer Introduction) .",

Here, we report an average (22 SE) gut passage time of 14.4 5 8.7 h in T. gigas of 464 2 28 mg dry tissue weight. This is far longer than a gut passage time of about 2.9 h in the lamellibranch mussel M. edulis of similar size, as predicted using an established weight exponent (Hawkins et al., 1990) applied to equivalent data for mussels feeding actively in a particle-rich environment (Bayne et al., 1989) . Longer gut passage times increase the potential for extraction of nutrients from ingested matter, thus helping to explain why both net and gross absorption efficiencies recorded here for organic nitrogen in T. gigas (78.1 -+ 9.4% and 99.2 2 0.4%, respectively) were very much higher than previously recorded in M. edulis (56.1 ? 35.5% and 80.8 2 1.7%, respectively; Hawkins and Bayne, 1984) . As a possible explanation both of longer gut passage time and such high assimilation efficiencies, Yonge (1936) observed that the ducts leading into the digestive diverticula of tridacnid clams appear exceptionally wide, that \"every opportunity is taken of passing material into them\", and that \"only as a last resort is it (material) passed into the mid-gut\" (p. 294). This suggests that, compared with other lamellibranchs, a far higher proportion of the particles ingested by T. gigas are digested",

The remainder of this discussion will consider metabolic requirements for nitrogen, and the relative extent to which filter-feeding and nitrogen taken up as ammonium before translocation from zooxanthellae satisfy those requirements in T. gigus of different dry tissue weight. Rates of net ammonium excretion measured here in clams starved of particles whilst maintained in darkness for more than 10 days may be assumed to reflect basal maintenence requirements for endogenous protein as a source of energy in the host tissues alone (MRH, mg protein.",

However, comparison of the intercepts for Eqs. 7 and 8 confirms that, even in particlestarved T. gigas, rates of nitrogen excretion from the host were almost twice (p < 0.05) the full maintenance requirements for both endogenous and exogenous protein-nitrogen in M. edulis of similar dry tissue weight. This is consistent with previous data suggesting greater catabolic reliance upon proteinaceous substrates among bivalves from lower latitudes, where greater environmental stability may reduce the requirements for carbon-rich reserves (Hawkins et al., 1987) . It is significant that the assimilation by zooxanthellae of ammonium-nitrogen (AZS) was greater than the basal excretion of endogenous protein-nitrogen by host tissues (EN) in particle-starved T. gigas larger than 0.001 g dry tissue weight (Table 1) . Therefore, if starved of particles, the host tissues of adult clams may obtain all basal nitrogen requirements from zooxanthellae, and larger T. gigus may actually be in positive nitrogen balance, although any growth would be slower than in clams feeding upon natural particles.",

Alternatively, nitrogen ingested as particles contributed as much as 63% of the total requirements of very small clams, declining steadily to only 23% in clams of 10 g dry tissue weight (Fig. 7, Table 1 ). We have earlier reported that T. gigas smaller than about 0.1 g dry tissue weight require carbon intake from both ingested particles and zooxanthellae to achieve observed rates of growth (Klumpp et al., 1992) . Here, the contribution from filter-feeding towards total nitrogen requirements began to exceed the estimated contribution from algal symbionts in T. gigas of less than the same size (about 0.1 g dry tissue weight; Fig. 7) . In addition, it is notable that total host tissue excretion represented a fairly constant proportion (0.37 ? 0.02, mean & 2 SE) of the total requirements for growth and metabolism in each size class (n = 4), so that zooxanthellae only began to contribute more nitrogen than was already excreted and recycled within clams larger than about 0.1 g dry tissue weight (Fig. 7) (Table  1) .

Clam larvae acquire all their zooxanthellae from surrounding seawater, so that newlymetamorphosed clams have fewer symbionts during the early stages of infection with zooxanthellae (Fitt et al., 1986 (Fitt et al., , 1993 Fitt, 1993) . This helps to explain why, when starved of particles, T. gigas larvae did not survive beyond metamorphosis (Southgate, 1988) . Similarly, in the present study, small T. gigas were the first to die when particle-starved during prolonged darkness (refer Results). Presumably, compared with larger clams, those smallest individuals and larvae lacked sufficient zooxanthellae to retain and recycle as much of the ammonium excreted when host tissues catabolized structural proteins as the main source of energy. Under natural cycles of daylight, greater dependence of small T. gigas on suspended particles may also reflect the observation that zooxanthellae are increasingly shaded as the mantle becomes relatively thicker in larger clams, with the result that photosynthetic rates in juvenile T. gigus become saturated at levels of irradiance that are commonly below ambient, whereas photosynthetic rates in larger clams are not saturated at even the highest natural light intensities (Fisher et al., 1985) . Although not as obvious in gross terms, it should be remembered that particulate feeding may continue to play a lifelong role in helping to satisfy more specific requirements for essential amino acids, phosphorus and/or trace metals. Irrespective of size, ingested particles and ammonium-nitrogen acquired by zooxanthellae together satisfied a constant proportion of about 70% of total amino-nitrogen requirements for observed tissue growth and metabolism (Fig. 7 ). Yet ingested particles and zooxanthellae more than satisfied the total requirements for carbon; those requirements having been computed using the same observed rates of particle filtration and tissue growth ( Fig. 7 ; data from Klumpp et al., 1992) . There are at least three possible explanations for this apparent shortfall in amino-nitrogen:",

(2) T. gigus may effect net uptake of dissolved inorganic nitrogen either as ammonium or nitrate (Wilkerson and Trench, 1986; Fitt et al., 1993) both of which stimulate tissue growth (Heslinga et al., 1990; Braley, 1992; Belda et al., 1993) . Rates of nitrate uptake were consistently less than of ammonium uptake, when offered separately (Fitt et al., 1993) and nothing is known of any possible ammonium repression of nitrate uptake. However, we have recorded concentrations of up to 1.0 ,uM nitrate on the back of the reef flat at Davies Reef, compared with an associated maximum of 0.45 ,uM ammonium (Klumpp & Hawkins, unpubl. data) . Therefore, it is possible that T. gigas assimilated dissolved nitrogen as nitrate whilst growing on Davies Reef. (3) Some of the \"missing\" nitrogen may have been acquired by T. gigas as dissolved organic matter (DOM). The epidermis of T. gigus mantle is highly convoluted, being made up of microvilli with micropinocytotic channels, and therefore appears adapted for the active uptake of DOM (Fankboner, 1971 ). The only confirmation of such uptake in tridacnids has been the work of Goreau et al. (1973) , who described incorporation of [3H]-leucine from ambient seawater into the mantle and ctenidial epithelia of T. maxima. In other non-symbiotic bivalves, relatively recent work using high performance liquid chromatography under bacteria-free conditions has confirmed the uptake both of amino acids and sugars, which appear to satisfy very significant proportions of up to at least 24% of measured energy expenditure (Hawkins & Bayne, 1991) . Admittedly, uptake of DOM may only be important as a source of energy in small T. gigas, or during prolonged darkness. But as a potential additional source of amino-nitrogen, then DOM may be of greater general significance.",

Therefore, we have estimated this excretion of exogenous nitrogen by host tissues (EX, mg N. d-') in T. gigas as 0.12 X protein absorption (Table 1) . To calculate the total assimilation of ammonium-nitrogen by zooxanthellae in particle-fed T. gigas (AZF) (mg N. day-'), we assume that zooxanthellae assimilate all of both the endogenous and exogenous nitrogen excreted as ammonium by host tissues before that nitrogen is lost from the clam. This is probably not appropriate for the smallest T. gigas, as particle-starved clams smaller than about 0.06 mg dry tissue weight showed net losses of ammonium (refer Eq. 2 above). However, this would result in an overestimation of the nitrogen assimilated by zooxanthellae, and thus will not affect our conclusion that zooxanthellae contribute only a small fraction of the total nitrogen requirements of very young clams (refer Discussion).On this basis, AZF (mg N. day-') has been calculated as (AZS + EX) (Table  1) . In turn, we have computed the contribution of ammonium-nitrogen translocated from zooxanthellae (AT) to help satisfy the clam's nitrogen requirements as the total uptake of ammoniumnitrogen by zooxanthellae (AZF) multiplied by the mean fraction (0.95) of \"N which, released from zooxanthellae, was subsequently incorporated within host tissues of our experimental clams ( Fig. 4 ) ( Table 1) . Fig. 7 illustrates the relative calculated contributions of organic nitrogen absorbed from filtered particles (A) and ammonium-nitrogen translocated from zooxanthellae (AT) towards the total requirements for observed tissue growth and metabolism (G + U) (Table 1) . Nitrogen absorbed from ingested particles represented the main estimated contribution (>63%) to the total requirements of very small clams, but this contribution declined steadily with increasing size to only 23% in clams of 10 g dry tissue weight. Alternatively, whilst almost insignificant in the smallest clams, the estimated contribution from zooxanthellae increased with size, becoming greater than from ingested particles for clams larger than about 0.1 g dry tissue weight. Irrespective of clam size, the collective contributions from both filtered particles and the ammonium translocated from zooxanthellae together satisfied a constant proportion of about 70% of the total requirements for observed tissue growth and metabolism ( Fig. 7 ).",

    "abstract": "Coral photosynthesis is carried out by Symbiodiniaceae algae only. Light absorption occurs in the thylakoid antenna system, which in peridinin plastid-containing algae as Symbiodiniaceae consists of a membrane embedded chlorophyll a-chlorophyll c 2-peridinin protein complex (acpPC) and a water soluble peridinin-chlorophyll a-protein complex (PCP) 22. These antennas transfer energy to photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) reaction centers, allowing charge separation, and a linear electron flow (LEF) from oxidation of water molecules at the PSII donor side to reduction of NADP + at the PSI acceptor side. The intermediate Cytochrome b 6 f complex oxidises the plastoquinol pool (electron acceptor of PSII) and reduces cytochrome c 6 (cyt c 6 ; electron donor of PSI), meanwhile translocating protons to the lumenal side of the thylakoid. This transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient is then used by the CF 1 F O ATP synthase complex. The availability of NADPH and ATP for CO 2 fixation depends largely on a complex balance between the different processes producing and consuming the electrochemical proton gradient, ATP and NADPH. An alternative cyclic electron flow (CEF), involving PSI and Cytochrome b 6 f, may work to balance the energetic requirements for CO 2 fixation. CEF activity, by contributing to increase the electrochemical proton gradient, accomplishes two main functions that are driving the synthesis of extra ATP and inducing a non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) dissipation mechanism that may prevent PSII photoinhibition 23. CEF has been poorly studied in Symbiodiniaceae and its role under steady physiological conditions, both in culture and in hospite, is not clear. Carbon fixation is carried out by a type II Rubisco which is characterized by a low CO 2-O 2 selectivity factor, and requires the presence of an efficient CO 2 concentrating mechanism 24,25 largely controlled by the host 26,27 that limits the occurrence of the photorespiratory pathway. After accomplishing carbohydrate synthesis, an important amount of photosynthetic products is transported to the host thanks to the expression of membrane transporters. The photosynthetic activity of corals is dynamic at different levels of time and space scales in coral reefs 30 , and it has been shown to be highly coupled with nutrients and water flow 7. The delicate balance of symbiosis in corals can be disrupted as a consequence of affections in the photosynthetic activity. For instance, a decrease in the electron transfer at the PSII acceptor side in heat sensitive species, leads to damage in thylakoid membranes and potentially to bleaching 32. Altogether, this points out the importance of studying Symbiodiniaceae photosynthesis in hospite. At the cellular level, different regulatory mechanisms of photosynthetic electron flow help to balance the light energy absorbed and the energetic requirements for carbon fixation in microalgae 33. The characterization of these mechanisms has been achieved through in vivo PSII-related chlorophyll a fluorescence 34. This technique has shown that different Symbiodiniaceae isolates show diverse photobiological responses to light changes 35. For instance, the presence of CEF has been suggested to occur in Symbiodinium genus (formerly Clade A) both freeliving and in symbiosis 36. The combination of chlorophyll a fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurements also showed that Symbiodinium sp. in culture activates a light-enhanced dark respiration during photosynthesis 8. A more detailed characterization through the combination of various techniques (O 2 exchange, PSII chlorophyll a fluorescence emission, PSI primary electron donor [P700] absorbance change in the far-red spectrum, and analysis of the thylakoid transmembrane electric field), revealed that an oxygen-dependent reduction at the acceptor side of PSI occurs as photoprotective mechanism in Symbiodinium isolates 37,38. Spectrophotometric measurements of PSI activity performed in the anemone model species Exaiptasia pallida harboring Breviolum sp. (formerly Clade B) revealed that exposure to high temperature can stimulate the CEF capacity 23. However, on corals such studies are still scarce because: (1) their morphology is not suitable for most spectroscopic apparatus that accommodate 1 cm 2 cuvette; (2) the thickness and nature of their calcareous skeleton makes coral branches or nubbins not homogenous spectroscopic objects, scattering and poorly transmitting detecting light; (3) actinic light cannot be delivered in a homogenous manner on all sides of the coral specimens even in simple systems, like in oximeter chambers. The simultaneous monitoring of in vivo PSI and PSII activity in corals has been attempted by using the pulseamplitude-modulation technique (Dual-PAM, Walz, Germany) which records variable chlorophyll a fluorescence and P700 photo-oxidation. Hoogenboom et al. 39 analysed the laminar coral Turbinaria reniformis and concluded that PSI was not a major site for damage during thermal stress. They also suggested the existence of CEF at high light intensities because of a decoupling between PSII and PSI activity was observed, but no clear results were obtained from the branching coral S. pistillata. In contrast, a recent study using improved settings of the Dual-PAM in reflectance mode, in combination with chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics, showed a strong sensitivity of PSI to a Calvin cycle inhibitor and thermal stress in the plate-like coral Pavona decussata.

In this work we performed chlorophyll-a fluorescence, oxygen exchange and timeresolved absorption spectroscopy measurements on small and thin fragments (0.3 cm 2 ) of the coral Stylophora pistillata. We showed that the capacity of mitochondrial alternative oxidase accounted for ca. 25% of total coral respiration, and that the high-light dependent oxygen uptake, commonly present in isolated Symbiodiniaceae, was negligible. The ratio between photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) active centers as well as their respective electron transport rates, indicated that PSI cyclic electron flow occurred in high light in S. pistillata and in some branching and lamellar coral species freshly collected in the field. Altogether, these results show the potential of applying advanced biophysical and spectroscopic methods on small coral fragments to understand the complex mechanisms of coral photosynthesis and respiration and their responses to environmental changes.",

                "text": "Coral reefs owe most of their high diversity and productivity to energetic relationships occurring in Scleractinian corals 1 . Coral symbiotic nature is characterized by a complex metabolism integration between the cnidarian host and its photosynthetic endosymbiont (Symbiodiniaceae, dinoflagellate) 2, 3 . The coral physiology is thus determined by multiple metabolic traits 4 from which respiration and photosynthesis are the utmost driving processes 5 . Coral bioenergetics has been investigated through gas exchange analysis thanks to the development of different systems which allow measurements in situ (e.g. 6, 7 ) or in laboratory (e.g. 8, 9 ). Coral respiration is largely fuelled by photosynthetically-derived carbon molecules , by active heterotrophy , and by oxygen released during photosynthesis . It is carried out in both animal and algal mitochondria by the respiratory complexes (Complex I, II, III, IV and F 1 F O ATP synthase) which fulfils most of the cellular ATP demands. Host mitochondrial electron transport activity is directly related to respiratory substrates availability . However, it has been suggested that the way in which corals consume storage molecules, as lipids, may be related to their sensitivity to bleaching conditions . In the model sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida, thermal stress causes a decrease in gene expression of cytochrome c and ATP synthase subunit a, and ultimately to mitochondria degradation and apoptosis 15 . Cnidarian cellular physiology seems to be intimately linked to mitochondrial redox state . Beyond this, the role of non-proton pumping (and consequently non-ATP yielding) alternative respiratory enzymes, such as alternative NADH dehydrogenases and alternative ubiquinol oxidase (AOX) which genes are present in the cnidarian genome 17, 18 , is still unknown. Differently from the host, Symbiodiniaceae mitochondria lack the canonical NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) but possess an AOX 19, 20 . Understanding the contribution of all these components to symbiont and host respiration will help to characterize the physiological responses of corals to natural oxygen variations in the reefs and its interaction with stress 21 .",

A third longitudinal cut determined the thickness of the fragment. The longitudinal cut in the shrubby coral P. damicornis was made in the skeleton regions thicker than 3 mm. Laminar corals P. speciosa and P. cactus were cut perpendicularly to the plane of the skeleton. This procedure was performed out of the aquarium and took less than 30 s per fragment, after which it was rapidly immersed in another sea water container to remove debris. Coral fragments were analysed within one hour after being cut (termed 'day 0') or thereafter maintained in the same aquarium conditions as their parent colony.",

The overall shape of the ECS spectrum of S. pistillata was similar to the one of its isolated symbiotic algae (S. microadriaticum), with a maximum and a minimum observed at 510 nm and around 560 nm, respectively (Fig. 6a) . The ratio between maximum (510 nm) and minimum (560 nm) values was smaller in coral fragments than in isolated algae. We then assessed the amplitude of the fast ECS (< 1 ms) at 554 nm in response to a saturating single turnover flash (Fig. 6b) . Under these conditions, the amplitude of the ECS is proportional to the amount of active PSI + PSII (reviewed in 49 ). Addition of Hydroxylamine (HA) and DCMU, two PSII inhibitors, halved the amplitude of the ECS both in coral fragments of S. pistillata and isolated S. microadriaticum (Fig. 6b) , indicating that PSI to PSII ratio is about 1 in both cases.",

It was not possible to test PSI:PSII stoichiometry in these coral species because a saturating flash laser was not available at that time of analysis. Spectroscopic-based photosynthesis activity measurements allowed us to compare different parameters obtained from small coral fragments. In S. pistillata, rETR-PSII linearly correlated (R 2 = 0.999, p = 0.0005) to rETR-PSI up to the minimum saturating light intensity (around 200 \u00b5mol photons m \u22122 s \u22121 ), after which PSI activity continued increasing compared to PSII (Fig. 7a) . Corals from the field revealed different responses when PSI and PSII activities were compared (Fig. 7b) .

In our thin coral fragments of S. pistillata this ratio is 1.23 \u00b1 0.16, a value in good agreement with S. pistillata branches (10 to 15 cm long) collected in summer from the Gulf of Aqaba (1.4) 56 , or from nubbins (2 to 3 cm long) prepared from S. pistillata coral colonies grown in aquarium conditions (1.1 to 1.5) 63 . Similarities between our results and data from the literature show that values measured on small thin fragments give reliable information on energetic relationships as those measured from bigger pieces of corals. Alternative electron transport pathways in mitochondria and chloroplasts are described as regulators of the redox poise in the main electron transfer chains, and more generally are known for their influence on the energetic state of the cell 64 . By measuring oxygen consumption rates in S. pistillata in presence of inhibitors (Fig. 4) , we evidenced, for the first time, the presence of a cyanide-insensitive but SHAM-sensitive mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) activity in coral. In several algal species, AOX contributes to dissipate excess of redox equivalents produced in the chloroplast during photosynthetic activity (i.e. NAD(P)H) (e.g. 66 ). The capacity of the AOX pathway measured in S. pistillata was 24% of Rd and is in the range as values previously reported for different species of Symbiodiniaceae grown in culture 20, 65 . The observed lack of effect of the AOX inhibitor (i.e. SHAM) addition to fully respiring coral fragments demonstrates a high capacity of mitochondrial respiration through Complex IV. However, further studies are needed to determine the extent of both the cnidarian and photosymbiont's AOX contribution to whole holobiont respiration and to elucidate the role of AOX under control and stress conditions.",

                "text": "Besides, in several species of Symbiodiniaceae in culture, a high light-dependent oxygen uptake was found to occur at the acceptor side of PSI through a Mehler-type reaction 37, 38 . As illustrated in Fig. 3 , the linear relationship between rETR-PSII and oxygen evolution observed in S. pistillata suggests that the photosynthetic electron transfer rate in high light does not depend on an alternative electron pathway to oxygen reduction as it does in free living cultures (e.g. 37, 67 ). This result may be explained by a lower CO 2 limitation for symbionts in hospite www.nature.com/scientificreports/ compared to those isolated in culture 26, 37 , but does not exclude that a different strategy operates under high light intensities. In this respect, PSI-dependent CEF is another alternative photosynthetic pathway that has been suggested to play an important role in the energetic balance in Symbiodiniaceae 23, 36 . The most recommended way to assess CEF in vivo is to compare PSI and PSII activities 68 (Fig. 7) . Despite the fact that calculation of absolute electron transport was not assessed 69 in the present study, our results indicate the occurrence of CEF in high light in S. pistillata and in two laminar corals from the field (P. cactus and P. speciosa). In contrast, we found that light influenced at the same proportion the relative electron transport rate of both photosystems in A. formosa and P. damicornis, two branching coral species, indicating that CEF is neglectable in high light (Fig. 7) . It is worth to notice that these last four corals species harbour the same Durusdinium genus. A previous study, based on chlorophyll a fluorescence Serial Irradiation Pulses (SIP) method, indicated the absence of CEF in isolates of Durusdinium genus (referred as Clade D) 36 . Altogether, this highlights that involvement of photosynthetic alternative electron flows may strongly differ between corals harboring Symbiodiniaceae from the same genus. Contrastingly to PSII, the role of PSI on photoacclimation has just started to be revealed in Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellates . PSI has been the target of very few studies on coral photosynthesis due to technical constraints. An indirect determination made on freshly extracted algae from S. pistillata showed a higher PSI content in coral colonies in symbiosis with Symbiodinium sp. (referred as Clade A) than Cladocopium sp. (referred as Clade C) 61 , suggesting that PSI content can be determinant for coral photosynthesis adaptation to changing light regimes. Other studies, aiming to assess in vivo PSI activity in nubbins from other coral species were performed by following changes in light reflectance of 820 or 830 nm, and correcting the signal at 870 nm with a pulseamplitude-modulated Dual-PAM instrument (Walz, Germany) 39, 40 . With this method a correction at 870 nm is commonly implemented in PSI activity determination to deconvolute PC contribution in the far-red region 48 . However, due to the absence of PC in peridinin chloroplasts 44 we consider that this correction is not necessary in photosynthetic corals, and light-induced absorption change at 705 nm can be used (Fig. 1f) , as it commonly yields a high negative value in plants 46 and green algae 71 . In the case of Symbiodiniaceae isolates, absorbance change at 705 nm has been used with no major differences in kinetics of P700 photo-oxidation when a correction at 740 nm was applied (personal observation 37, 38 ) . Assuming that the molar attenuation coefficient of P700 at 705 nm of Symbiodiniaceae is in the range of values determined for P700 in green photosynthetic organisms www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (i.e. 64 mM \u22121 cm \u22121 in spinach 72 and 105 mM \u22121 cm \u22121 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 47 ), we estimated the number of P700 per chlorophyll a to be between 1/720 to 1/1180 in S. pistillata. This range of values is in good agreement with values reported for several Symbiodiniaceae isolates 35, 37 . Despite missing a molar absorption coefficient of P700 for peridinin plastids, our results indicate that spectroscopy-based measurement in thin coral fragments is a reliable and accurate strategy to ascertain PSI activity of coral endosymbionts (e.g. Fig. 5 ).",

We thus consider that coral fragments are good spectroscopic objects to obtain reliable information about coral photosynthesis. This approach does not consume large amounts of coral colonies or nubbins allowing to limit the loss of living samples when destructive measures are taken. This work paves the way towards a better understanding of the role of bioenergetics processes in coral symbiosis establishment and persistence.",

The limited stress tolerance of this species to high summer-like temperatures usually leads to mass mortality and great economic loss. However, there is limited information on the mechanisms underlying moderate heat responses in the liver of the rainbow trout. Here, we performed transcriptome profiling of rainbow trout liver under moderate heat stress by using the Hiseq\u2122 4000 sequencing platform. More than 277 million clean reads were obtained from 6 libraries and aligned against the rainbow trout genome. A total of 128 unique transcripts were differentially expressed in the liver under heatstress and control conditions, many heat shock protein genes for thermoregulation and some novel genes involved in heat stress were identified. Nine of the differently expressed genes were further validated by qRT-PCR. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that several pathways, including those for protein metabolism, energy metabolism, and immune system, were influenced by heat stress. Moreover, an important protein-processing pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was identified, and the key role of ER-associated degradation and function of calpain as an upstream regulator of apoptosis were confirmed under heat stress. The results of this study provide a comprehensive overview of heat stress-induced transcriptional patterns in rainbow trout liver and would be particularly useful for further studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to heat stress in this species.",

                "text": "Fish are ectotherms and usually exposed to daily or seasonal temperature fluctuations in their aquatic environments. Although fish can cope with some ranges of temperature variations through physiological plasticity or micro-evolution, severe diseases and death occur when they exceed their thermal tolerance capability (Whitehead et al., 2011; Bellard et al., 2012) . Therefore, physiological responses and thermal plasticity have become the focus of current stress research, given the growing threat of global warming. The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a cold-water salmonid species that is native to the Pacific coast of North America. In 1959, it was introduced to China and cultivated as the main variety because of its delicious taste and high nutritional value. The rainbow trout usually grows in the temperature range of 8 to 22\u00b0C, whereas the water temperature above 25\u00b0C is perilous for their survival (Matthews and Berg, 1997) ; the appropriate growth temperature is 12-18\u00b0C, and food intake and growth are impaired at temperatures above 20\u00b0C. The limited stress tolerance of the rainbow trout to high summer-like temperatures, especially in the cage culture environment, usually leads to mass mortality and great economic loss. Investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying heat stress in the rainbow trout will contribute to understanding its adaptation mechanism to thermal conditions and promote the development of heat-resistant breeding and technology for this species.",

However, heat stress responses are complex and not limited to a single or few regulatory genes or proteins. Recently, high-throughput analysis has been used in genetic and conservation genetic studies of various non-model animals, including studies of genome-wide changes in gene expression in ecologically important fish, and it provides detailed molecular information on the regulation of genes involved in physiological processes under conditions of temperature shock (Ekblom and Galindo, 2011) .",

The transcript levels of HSC70a, HSC70b, HSP47, HSP27, HSP90a, HSP90b, and HSP60 were changed when the rainbow trout underwent heat stress by HSP cloning and characterization Ojima et al., 1681; Ojima, 2007; Shi et al., 2015) . In 2010, Lewis published a paper on transcriptome responses to heat stress in the nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) of the rainbow trout by using microarrays and investigated the differences in RBC global gene transcription under control conditions (11\u00b0C) and heat stress conditions (1 h at 25\u00b0C, followed by recovery at 11\u00b0C) (Lewis et al., 2010) . To the best of our knowledge, it was the first study to provide an overall description of the transcriptome of teleost RBC and track stress responses at the mRNA level. Then, comparative analysis of transcriptome profiling between different rainbow trout strains was performed to reveal candidate genes responsible for upper temperature tolerance and different strategies used for coping with thermal stress (Tan et al., 2012; Rebl et al., 2013; Verleih et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2015) . Tan et al. performed RNA-seq analysis of 5 tissues in 2 strains of rainbow trout to investigate the genes related to upper temperature tolerance by administering 30 min of acute heat stress and found that the HSP genes and genes related to transcription factor AP-1 are constantly expressed 2-fold or more in almost all the tissues (Tan et al., 2015) . Rebl et al. identified differences in temperature-induced gene expression in the gill and kidney of native and imported strains and suggested links between the different temperature-dependent pathways and gene networks after a 2-week acclimation to mild heat by using the microarray approach (Rebl et al., 2013; Verleih et al., 2015) .",

The liver is the crucial metabolic organ associated with stress response, and little is known about the mechanisms underlying heat response in rainbow trout liver. Therefore, we focused on the transcriptome analysis of control rainbow trout liver (OM_CL) and heat-treated rainbow trout liver (OM_HL) to identify related genes and pathways regulated by heat stress; 128 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and several important pathways were identified. The results of this study will not only be helpful in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying heat stress in the rainbow trout but also provide valuable genetic information for heat-resistant breeding of this species under climate change conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available global transcriptome study of rainbow trout liver under moderate heat stress conditions.",

After 7 days of acclimation, the fish were randomly divided into 6 groups and acclimated for another 7 days in 300-L water tanks prior to the experiment. Then, the fish were treated with heat stress by using a temperature system that could continuously increase the temperature at a constant speed (increments of 1\u00b0C per 24 h). The temperature change was considered to approximately simulate the natural temperature increase in cage culture waters. The fish were anesthetized with a lethal dose of MS-222 before tissue sampling.

The sequencing totally generated 287,277,772 raw reads, which were deposited to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with the accession number of SRP092649. After removing the low-quality raw reads, 39.4-47.8 M clean reads were obtained from each library. The total read length was 41.65 Gb for the 6 samples. The major characteristics of the 6 libraries, including error rate and GC content, are summarized in Table 1 . The clean reads were aligned to the whole genome of rainbow trout by using TopHat v2.0.12. The results showed that the ratios of the clean reads mapped to the rainbow trout genome were 66.17-68.61% (Table 1 ). Because of the rainbow trout genome assembly was incomplete, the mapped ratios were a little bit lower than 70%, but it is well-known that the analysis results based on genome are more reliable than de novo transcriptome analysis. The read numbers mapped to each gene were calculated and normalized to FPKM to assess the gene expression levels; FPKM interval and total genes in each library are shown in Table S2 . In the samples, 43.39-51.07% of the mRNA transcripts were detected as FPKM N 1. Pearson's correlation coefficients (R 2 ) of 2 individuals in the same group were checked on the basis of the FPKM value of each sample to reflect the accuracy and reliability of the results; the closer R is to 1, the higher the similarity of the expression pattern between samples. Generally, R N 0.8 was considered suitable. The value of R was 0.92-0.93 among OM_CL1, OM_CL2, and OM_CL3 and 0.882-0.916 among OM_HL1, OM_HL2, and OM_HL3, which confirmed the sufficiently high similarity between the 3 biological replicates of the 2 rainbow trout groups ( Figure S1 ).",

In this study, liver transcriptome profiles of the rainbow trout in response to heat stress were obtained and analyzed using next-generation sequencing technologies. Numerous DEGs, key biological processes, and several important pathways involved in heat stress were found in the OM_CL and OM_HL groups.

HSPs can maintain cellular protein homeostasis under stress conditions by refolding thermally damaged proteins and preventing their cytotoxic aggregation (Feder and Hofmann, 1999) . In Tomanek's review, HSP expression and regulation among various fish species and variable thermal environments were discussed (Tomanek, 2010) ; however, these previous studies and data obtained in many cases can only be viewed as causal evidence.

In the gene database, at least 2 different HSP47 transcript fragments were available for the rainbow trout. Rebl et al. demonstrated that HSP47A in the gill and kidney was strongly upregulated, but HSP47B was depressed after mild heat stress (Rebl et al., 2013; Verleih et al., 2015) . In our study, the 2 HSP47 transcripts were both upregulated after heat stress. HSP90B is also present as duplicate variants A and B in rainbow trout . Modern salmonids are pseudo-tetraploids, and about 50% of the gene duplicates may be retained (Bailey et al., 1978; Hurley et al., 2007) . Accordingly, besides HSP47 and HSP90B, CDC37 (HSP90-co-chaperone) showed 2 gene duplications, and the expression levels were upregulated 4.6-fold and 4.2-fold, respectively. The information of HSPD1 and HSPE1 was limited in the rainbow trout with 3.8-fold and 3.1-fold induction, respectively. Although AHSA1 is a non-HSP, as an activator of the 90-kDa HSP ATPase homolog, it is also induced 4-fold under heat stress.",

The liver is an important organ for metabolic activities in fish, and it plays a crucial functional role in cellular metabolism and biosynthetic and detoxification activities (Houlihan et al., 1986) . In many types of fish, such as zebrafish (Vergauwen et al., 2010) , olive flounder (Hu et al., 2014) , and large yellow croaker (Qian and Xue, 2015) , altered metabolic rate is one of the most rapid cellular responses to increased temperature. In the present study, the functional classification and annotation of differential genes were performed using GO and KEGG analyses. These gene categories are mainly associated with changed metabolism. Under biological process, higher numbers of GO terms were assigned to protein metabolic process, metabolic process, glutamine metabolic process, primary metabolic process, cellular protein metabolic process, and isoprenoid metabolic process. Pathway analysis also showed that metabolic pathways such as metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, amino acids, terpenoids, polyketides, xenobiotics, and lipids represented the most abundant pathways. This indicated that the regulation of metabolic processes is an important part of temperature response in the rainbow trout. The transcript levels of most genes associated with metabolism, such as GCH1, ARG1, HMGCS1, ALAS1, CYPLA3, and several novel genes, were downregulated in a temperature-dependent manner. Among these genes, CYPLA3 belongs to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system and has widespread functions such as oxidization of a variety of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics (Mininni et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 1996) . Nonchemical exogenous parameters, such as environmental temperature and season, regulate the response of the CYP system (Sarasquete and Segner, 2000) . Significant downregulation of CYPLA3 suggested that the uptake of xenobiotics and the metabolic rate were reduced and that the demand for metabolic enzymes was also appropriately decreased.",

In this study, when the rainbow trout encountered mild temperature stress, heat-regulated genes involved in the immune response-NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling pathway belonged to the HSP90 family. The intracellular NLR family is composed of N20 members that have been demonstrated to function as regulators of the innate immune response against microbial pathogens. However, only NLR proteins are correctly folded and maintained in a recognition-competent state at the appropriate cellular location to function as sensors. Misfolded or used sensors are a threat to the cell and may cause inappropriate activation of downstream pathways that must be immediately inactivated and discarded. Such maintenance of NLR-type sensors requires a structurally and functionally conserved chaperone complex that consists of HSP90 and its cochaperone suppressor of SGT1 (Shirasu, 2009) . In addition to NOD1 and NOD2, 2 prototypic NLRs, a different set of NLRs, including NALR1, NALR3, and Ipaf, induces caspase-1 activation through the assembly of an Fig. 5 .

When the water temperature is increased, the fish immune systems are challenged by modified pathogen spectrums or low dissolved oxygen, but increased expression of stress proteins will contribute to the activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems (Pockley, 2003; Bowden, 2008) . In rainbow trout, significant upregulation of HSP90 family expression levels may be indirectly influenced by the immune system through the activation of NALP3 by SGT1 to induce caspase-1 activation under heat stress.",

In protein processing in the ER pathway, proteins that are terminally misfolded bind to BiP and are directed towards degradation through the proteasome in a process called as ERassociated degradation (ERAD). When encountering heat stress, the expression levels of HSP70 and HSP90, which participate in the ERAD process in rainbow trout, were upregulated to promote the degradation of damaged proteins. Besides HSPs, protein disulfide isomerase associated 3 (PDIA3), which is a member of the PDI family and mainly located in the ER, has been demonstrated to bind to specific DNA sequences that encode DNA repair proteins involved in the stress response (Chichiarelli et al., 2007) . CCT3 is the gamma subunit of the T-complex protein-1 (TCP1) complex, which belongs to the HSP60 family protein, and it plays a pivotal role in the folding of actins, tubulins, and other proteins in an ATP-dependent manner and assembly of cytoskeleton protein(s) as an individual or complexed with other subunits (Archibald et al., 2000; Bhaskar et al., 2012; Amit et al., 2010) . Structural proteins would be at a disadvantage under high temperature conditions, and their misfolding and/or denaturation contributes greatly to protein aggregation (Lee and Lai, 1995) . Previous studies have indicated increased expression of cytoskeletal proteins in response to temperature stress in teleosts (Rebl et al., 2013; Verleih et al., 2015; Podrabsky and Somero, 2004; Buckley et al., 2006) . In the present study, experimental temperature changes from 18\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C triggered the regulation of structurally associated genes (PDIA3 and CCT3) that assist in the folding of a large number of proteins of multiple structural classes and complex topologies and ensured the recovery and maintenance of normal liver functions in the rainbow trout.",

Calpain is involved in several physiological processes, such as cell-cycle regulation, activation of transcription factors, differentiation, and apoptosis (Saido et al., 1994; Squier and Cohen, 1996) . Apoptosis is a genetically programmed process for the elimination of damaged or redundant cells by the activation of caspases (aspartate-specific cysteine proteases). Caspase-12-mediated apoptosis is a specific apoptotic pathway of the ER. Calpain is an upstream regulator of apoptosis, and it can promote or prevent apoptosis indirectly through activation or inhibition of caspase-12 activation.",

A large number of DEGs were identified between the control group and heat-stress group, and some well-described genes for thermoregulation, such as HSP47, HSP90, and HSP70, were also activated. In addition, many novel genes like CYPLA3, CCT3, and PDIA3 are possibly involved in thermal acclimation processes. Multiple pathways involved in the metabolism of amino acids, cofactors and vitamins, lipids, terpenoids, polyketides, and xenobiotics and immune systems were influenced by heat stress. Moreover, a key protein processing pathway in the ER was identified, and the essential role of ERAD and function of calpain as an upstream regulator of apoptosis were confirmed. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to challenging temperatures in the rainbow trout and provide a theoretical basis for heat-resistant breeding of this species under climate change conditions.",

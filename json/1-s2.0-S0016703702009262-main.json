    "abstract": "The high precision measurement of the Sr/Ca ratio in corals has the potential for measuring past sea surface temperatures at very high accuracy. However, the veracity of the technique has been questioned on the basis that there is both a spatial and temporal variation in the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater, and that kinetic effects, such as the calcification rate, can affect the Sr/Ca ratio of corals, and produce inaccuracies of the order of 2-4\u00b0C. In the present study, a number of cores of the massive hermatypic scleractinian coral Porites, from the central Great Barrier Reef, have been analyzed for Sr/Ca at weekly to monthly resolution. Results from a 24 year record from Myrmidon Reef show an overall variation from 22.7\u00b0C to 30.4\u00b0C. The record shows a warming/cooling trend with maximum warming centred on the 1986-1987 summer. While some bleaching was reported to have occurred at Myrmidon Reef in 1982, the Sr/Ca record indicates that subsequent summer temperatures were much higher. The 4.5 year record from Stanley Reef shows a maximum SST of 30\u00b0C during the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o event. The calibrations from Myrmidon and Stanley Reefs are in excellent agreement with previously published calibrations from nearby reefs. While corals do not calcify in equilibrium with seawater due to physiological control on the uptake of Sr and Ca into the lattice of coralline aragonite, it can be argued that, provided only a single genus such as Porites sp. is used, and that the coral is sampled along a major vertical growth axis, then the Sr/Ca ratio should vary uniformly with temperature. Similarly, objections based on the spatial and temporal variability of the Sr/Ca activity ratio of seawater can be countered on the basis that in most areas where coral reefs grow there is a uniformity in the Sr/Ca activity ratio, and there does not appear to be a change in this ratio over the growth period of the coral. Evidence from several corals in this study suggest that stress can be a major cause of the breakdown in the Sr/Ca-SST relationship. Thermal stress, resulting from either extremely warm or cool temperatures, can produce anomalously low Sr/Ca derived SSTs as a result of the breakdown of the biological control on Sr/Ca fractionation. It is considered that other stresses, such as increased nutrients and changes in light intensity, can also lead to a breakdown in the Sr/Ca-SST relationship. Two of the main issues affecting the reliability of the Sr/Ca method are the calibration of the Sr/Ca ratio with measured SST and the estimation of tropical last glacial maximum (LGM) palaeotemperatures. Instead of producing a constant calibration, just about every one published so far is different from the others. What is obvious is that for most calibrations while the slope of the calibration equation is similar, the intercepts are not. While the cause for this variation is still unknown, it would appear that corals from different localities around the world are responding to their own particular environment or that certain types of environments exert a control on the corals' physiology. Sr/Ca derived SST estimates for the LGM and deglaciation of 5\u00b0C-6\u00b0C cooler than present are at odds with estimates of 2\u00b0C-3\u00b0C cooling by other climate proxies. The apparent lack of reef growth during the LGM suggests that SSTs were too cold in many parts of the tropics for reefs to develop. This would lend support to the idea that tropical SSTs were much cooler than what the CLIMAP data suggests.",

Only in the past two decades has a sufficient volume of instrumental data been acquired to observe the onset and development of El Ni\u00f1o, but even now our understanding of what initiates it and how it propagates is rudimentary because of the variability inherent in this phenomenon (Cane et al., 1995) . In order to create better prediction models it is necessary to extend the El Ni\u00f1o record back by several centuries so as to assess the frequency and magnitude of key variables, such as SST. While the instrumental record is very sketchy at this time scale, massive corals, such as Porites sp., have the ability to live for up to 300 -500 years or more, and, because their growth rate is commonly of the order of 1-2 cm yr \u03ea1 , it is possible to retrieve high resolution (weekly to monthly) SST records by measuring their Sr/Ca ratio. Modern scleractinian corals not only have the capability of providing continuous climate data, but, by means of radiocarbon and U-series dating, their fossil counterparts can provide snapshots of climatic conditions for the last few hundred thousand years or so, and possibly longer.",

This assumption has been brought into question recently as a result of model studies of Sr release from shelf carbonates during low sea level (glacial) events (Stoll and Schrag, 1998) , and variations in foraminiferal Sr/Ca during late Quaternary glacial/interglacial cycles (Martin et al., 1999; Stoll et al., 1999) . When Sr-rich aragonitic shallow marine sediments, such as corals and the green alga Halimeda, are exposed on the shelf during eustatic sea level lowering subaerial diagenesis of aragonite to low-Mg calcite by meteoric water occurs, resulting in the release of strontium. It has been proposed by Stoll and Schrag (1998) that this may raise Sr/Ca seawater by to 2 percent. While this increase is small, it has the ability to produce a shift of 2\u00b0C-3\u00b0C in palaeotemperatures derived from coral Sr/Ca ratios. Measurements of the Sr/Ca ratio in planktonic and benthic foraminifera show variations of up to 12% over glacial/interglacial cycles (Stoll et al., 1999) . While this variation is much greater than the model results of Stoll and Schrag (1998) , a large part of it can be explained by selective dissolution of foraminiferal tests and other environmental effects such as temperature and pH (Martin et al., 1999) . However, both Stoll et al. (1999) and Martin et al. (1999) maintain that up to 3-5% can be attributed directly to Sr/Ca seawater variations.",

Traditionally, the Sr/Ca value representative of the marine environment has been reported as 8.6 \u03ee 0.4 mmol mol \u03ea1 (Kinsman, 1969) . Analyses of seawater samples by de Villiers et al.

Additional Sr/Ca analysis of surface waters from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by de Villiers (1999) averaged 8.539 \u03ee 0.0045 mmol mol \u03ea1 , and it was suggested that surface waters are depleted by 2-3% relative to the deep ocean as a result of skeletal formation of celestite (SrSO 4 ) by acantharians (e.g., Bernstein et al., 1987) .",

In general, aragonite will accommodate more Sr than calcite. The higher uptake of Sr into aragonite rather than calcite is a function of the higher distribution coefficient for the former (Bathurst, 1976) . The distribution coefficient, D Sr A \u03ed (Sr/Ca) aragonite /(Sr/Ca) seawater , for corals is considered to be close to unity (Weber, 1973) , whereas for inorganically precipitated aragonite it is about 1.15 (Kinsman and Holland, 1969) .",

Some workers (e.g., Thompson and Livingston, 1970; Thompson and Chow, 1955) found no correlation between temperature and Sr/Ca, whereas others (e.g., Houck et al., 1977; Kinsman, 1969; Smith et al., 1979) found that the Sr/Ca ratio varied as a simple function of temperature. In his comprehensive study of the incorporation of Sr into corals, Weber (1973) found an inverse relationship between temperature and D Sr A , but considered growth rate and other \"species effects\" to be more important. Both field and laboratory studies carried out by Houck et al. (1977) and Smith et al. (1979) further strengthened the case for temperature dependence. They maintained that there is a distinct linear relationship between the Sr/Ca ratio and the ambient water temperature at which the precipitation of skeletal aragonite occurs, which is basically independent of growth rate. They were also able to show that D Sr A for corals is significantly different from inorganically precipitated aragonite, and that D Sr A varies between different coral genera. This was attributed to some form of biological control, whereby the Sr/Ca ratio in the tissue of the coral is slightly modified from the seawater Sr/Ca ratio.",

(1992) were able to show a good correlation between the Sr/Ca ratio and SST, a note of caution was introduced by de Villiers et al. (1994) . They suggested that interspecific differences, variable calcification, and extension rates, and variability in the Sr/Ca composition of seawater could introduce significant errors (1-2\u00b0C) in the use of this method. In a subsequent paper (de Villiers et al., 1995) , the Sr/Ca-based proxy was further called into question on the basis of biological control of Sr/Ca uptake. They measured three specimens of Porites lobata from Hawaii; two of which were only 20 m apart and the Sr/Ca seawater showed no measurable difference. All three grew at the same rate of 12 mm yr \u03ea1 and SST records from both areas are substantially the same. Their results show three different trends in Sr/Ca, and consequently three distinctly different calibrations, with differences from the same reef as much as 2\u00b0C-3\u00b0C.",

In southern Taiwan, Sr/Ca measurements on Porites lobata and P. lutea by Shen et al. (1996) showed that species differences and growth rate variations did not appear to affect the Sr/Ca-SST relationship. Similar conclusions were reached by Alibert and McCulloch (1997) for the central Great Barrier Reef, where they found that the relationship holds true for a large range of annual extension and calcification rates, but provided that sampling was conducted along the major growth axis. They found that sampling off axis introduced errors of 1\u00b0C-2\u00b0C because corallites from different growth periods were being sampled simultaneously, whereas this effect was negated by sampling along the major axis of growth. Such off axis sampling could account for the variable results of de Villiers et al. (1995) .",

Ideally, the comparison between the coral Sr/Ca ratio and an in situ instrumental SST record for the same time period from the same reef is the best method, but, with a few exceptions, this has not proved feasible. The main reason is that few reefs in the world have recorded continuous SST measurements for any length of time. In only a few examples have the corals been calibrated against the in situ SST record (e.g., Alibert and McCulloch, 1997; Crowley et al., 1999) . However, even in this situation the calibrations can be nonuniform. Alibert and McCulloch (1997) derived separate calibrations for five Porites sp. from Davies Reef in the central Great Barrier Reef. While three corals (Davies 2, 8, 11) produced calibrations with an accuracy of \u03ee0.5\u00b0C, two others (Davies 3 & A) showed errors of up to \u03ee1.5\u00b0C. This anomaly is further examined in the Discussion (see Sect. 5.5).",

In particular, Sr/Ca records from nearby reefs, the same reef, and even from the same coral head need to be examined in detail to demonstrate their reliability and accuracy. In order to produce an accurate SST record, there is a requirement for the coral record to be calibrated against a long term instrumental SST record. To date, very few studies have been able to measure Sr/Ca derived SSTs with in situ instrumental SST from the same reef. Many studies must rely on data from SST stations that are remote to the coral site (e.g., de Villiers et al., 1994) , and this is considered to be a significant uncertainty in deriving accurate Sr/Ca-SST relationships. The present study is designed to partly address some of the above requirements. A coral from Myrmidon Reef on the shelf edge of the central Great Barrier Reef (Fig. 1 ) has been analyzed for Sr/Ca in order to compare it to a 9 year instrumental record from the same reef. This is one of the longest instrumental datasets on any reef so far that has also been analyzed for Sr/Ca. In addition, a three year Sr/Ca derived SST record from Stanley Reef, a mid-shelf reef about 130 km southeast of Myrmidon Reef (Fig. 1) , has been produced. These two Sr/Caderived SST records are compared to others in the area, such as Davies Reef McCulloch, 1997), Pandora Reef (McCulloch et al., 1994) , and Orpheus Island (Gagan et al., 1998 ) so as to determine if the Sr/Ca-SST calibrations from a single region are consistent. Using these results, and studies from elsewhere, we discuss the problems, both real and apparent, that have been raised regarding the reliability of the method.",

It has been noted previously that Sr/Ca ratios in the vicinity of the tissue layer can produce anomalous results. In several corals from Davies Reef, Alibert and McCulloch (1997) report anomalous Sr/Ca ratios in the tissue layer, which they attributed to remnants of organic material within this zone. However, while they recorded high Sr/Ca ratios at the top, the Sr/Ca ratios from Myr-2 are uniformly low. The cores from both sites were sampled during the austral winter/spring, July at Myrmidon Reef and October at Davies Reef. At this time of year, it would be expected that the Sr/Ca ratio would be relatively high, so the low Sr/Ca ratios in the top 2.5 mm at Myrmidon Reef are somewhat difficult to explain. It could be that the Sr/Ca ratio of the organic material is highly variable, and capable of masking skeletal Sr/Ca.",

Although the latter warming trend is not that apparent in Figure 5 , the instrumental data shows that this warming trend continued into 1998. The earlier warming trend is reversed slightly in 1983-1984, with the cool El Ni\u00f1o winter of 1982 being repeated in 1983 and 1984, while the 1983-1984 summer is 1.2\u00b0C cooler than those immediately before and after ( Fig. 5 ).

During this period, the maximum SST reached or exceeded 30\u00b0C on four occasions. According to Lough (1999) this temperature represents the threshold for coral bleaching in this region. In Fig. 5 the 30\u00b0C threshold is 1\u00b0C higher than the average summer maximum, a figure that is often used as a minimum condition for the onset of bleaching (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999). On the basis of temperature alone, one would have expected bleaching of the more susceptible Acropora and Pocillopora species to have occurred definitely during the summer of 1986 -1987, probably in 1982-1983 and 1984 -1985, and possibly in 1987-1988, but not in 1981-1982 . This is exactly the opposite of what happened, with no signs of bleaching at Myrmidon Reef during the 1986 -1987 summer (Berkelmans, private communication, 2000) , and no reports of bleaching in Fig. 4 .

While the largest effect of the El Ni\u00f1o cycle is the variability in rainfall along the coastal region of Queensland, there does tend to be a typical SST signal associated with that phenomenon. According to Lough (1994) , there are two components to the SST signal associated with El Ni\u00f1o. One is the cooler than average SST for the winter prior to the onset of El Ni\u00f1o, and the other is the warmer than average SST during the following summer when the El Ni\u00f1o is fully active.

As with other corals analyzed by the Sr/Ca TIMS method in the central Great Barrier Reef [e.g., Pandora Reef (McCulloch et al., 1994) and Davies Reef (Alibert and McCulloch, 1997) ], there is a distinct cooling in the winter of 1982 at Myrmidon Reef associated with the intense El Ni\u00f1o event of 1982-1983 ( Fig. 5) . At Myrmidon Reef the Sr/Ca derived SSTs show a drop of around 7\u00b0C at the end of summer in 1982, compared to the average summer-winter SST range of 5.5\u00b0C, followed by an even larger rise from the winter of 1982 to the late summer in 1983 (Fig. 5) . However, apart from this extreme event there does not appear to be the precise SST signal, as outlined by Lough (1994) , for the other El Ni\u00f1o events. The 1976 -1977 event shows neither unusual cooling nor warming; in fact, it shows the coolest summer for the whole period of the coral record (Fig. 5) . The 1986 -1987 event is almost the exact opposite to the 1976 -1977 event, with the warmest winter of the period followed by the warmest summer. The 1991-1992 event shows winter cooling, but only moderate summer warming ( Fig. 5) .",

This is about the same length of time against which the Davies 2 coral was calibrated (Alibert and McCulloch, 1997) . The resulting fit (Fig. 6 ) is very good, and both large-scale and fine-scale detail can be seen to match in many parts of the curves. A least squares regression analysis was carried out for the time equivalent Sr/Ca ratio and instrumental SST, similar to that used for Myr-2, with a total of 66 data points being analyzed. The error limits used were the same as for the Myrmidon Reef calibration.

It is noteworthy that during the 1997 winter, SSTs were only moderately low, and the typical El Ni\u00f1o signal of cool winter followed by warm summer as outlined by Lough (1994) is not as apparent as during the 1982-1983 event. Of some note is the 1\u00b0C drop in temperature at the beginning of 1998 (Fig. 7) . A similar drop over much of the GBR is present in the instrumental data in early January of the same year, which Lough (1999) attributed to short-term cooling following the passage of a tropical low that produced extensive flooding on the central Queensland coast.

It is also within the error limits of the Davies Reef (Alibert and McCulloch, 1997) and the Myrmidon and Stanley Reef calibrations. Five separate Sr/Ca-SST calibrations have now been derived for the central GBR (Fig. 8) . Two of these (Davies and Myrmidon Reefs) are based on in situ SST measurements, two (Pandora and Stanley Reefs) are based on in situ SST measurements from nearby reefs, and one (Orpheus Island) is based on satellite SST data. Four of the calibrations are within the error limits of each other, whereas one, that from Orpheus Island Fig. 6 . Comparison between Sr/Ca data from Stanley Reef (black) and the instrumental data from nearby Davies Reef (grey). (Gagan et al., 1998) , shows a difference of some 3\u00b0C from the others (Fig. 8) . Again, the reason for the difference is not obvious. Even though the Orpheus calibration used satellite SSTs, there are no significant errors between satellite data and in situ SSTs that are currently being acquired for all these sites. The calibration from Orpheus Island is also very similar to calibrations derived for Java and Dampier, Western Australia by Gagan et al. (1998) . Davies, Stanley and Myrmidon Reefs occur on the outer half of the shelf and do not appear to be affected by freshwater discharge from the coast, whereas inshore reefs, such as Orpheus and Pandora are enveloped, during periods of high rainfall, by the freshwater plume from the Burdekin River to the south of Townsville. Lowering of salinity on these inner reefs during these discharge events is evident from the \u2426 18 O signal of the corals (Gagan et al., 1998; McCulloch et al., 1994) . However, the Sr/Ca activity ratio for inshore seawater does not appear to be adversely affected on an annual basis (Chantal Alibert, private communication, 1997), presumably because the discharges are relatively short lived.",

However, the mechanisms that control trace element incorporation into the coral skeleton remain imperfectly understood. Simple inorganic models predict that trace element partitioning is dependent upon the ionic composition of the calcifying fluid, the calcification rate, and the temperature (Sinclair, 1999) . Of these three factors, the coral has the ability to control, at least partly, the first two. While corals partition most trace elements at close to inorganic values, they do not calcify in equilibrium with seawater. For strontium this disequilibrium is relatively minor (e.g., D Sr A \u03f7 1.06 for Porites sp. and \u03f71.13 for inorganic aragonite), but it does indicate that physiology does play a significant role in its uptake.",

(1994 de Villiers et al. ( , 1995 . Their results from a Pavona clavus coral from the Galapagos Islands indicated that a change of annual extension rate from 6 to 12 mm yr \u03ea1 produced an apparent offset in SST of 1\u00b0C-2\u00b0C, with higher Sr/Ca values associated with the slower extension rate. The conclusion from this experiment was that variable extension rates do affect the amount of Sr uptake by the coral. Similarly, Alibert and McCulloch (1997) conducted experiments where they measured Sr/Ca ratios along both the growth axis and off axis. They found that off axis, the lack of space and less optimal conditions for growth result in small corallites and lower skeletal density, which shifted the Sr/Ca ratios by a variable amount toward high values, corresponding to a temperature shift of \u03ea1\u00b0C to \u03ea3\u00b0C. Whether the apparent temperature offset is caused by a real change in the Sr/Ca ratio in these off axis situations or by an overlap of corallites that have grown at different times of the year is hard to discern. However, it seems that the only way to overcome this disparity is to sample exclusively along the major growth axis. Because they did not do so, as indicated in Figure 11 of de Villiers et al. (1994) , appears to invalidate the de Villiers et al. (1994 Villiers et al. ( , 1995 argument regarding calcification rate. As pointed out earlier, subsequent work by Shen et al. (1996) and Alibert and McCulloch (1997) has shown a lack of change in Sr/Ca as a result of changes in calcification rate.",

It has been pointed out previously that there is a spatial difference in Sr/Ca in modern seawater of 2-3% globally, with the deep ocean more enriched relative to the surface (de Villiers, 1999) . Although this variability is very small, it does equate to an uncertainty of 2\u00b0C-3\u00b0C for Sr/Ca derived SST measurements. However, the Sr/Ca proxy in corals necessitates that records can only be obtained in the tropics, in seawater that is normally oligotrophic and is not usually susceptible to constant or intense upwelling. In such waters the average Sr/ Ca seawater value is considered to be 8.5 \u03ee 0.1 mmol mol \u03ea1 (de Villiers et al., 1994) , and reported Sr/Ca seawater measurements in coral reef areas only vary between 8.464 and 8.551 mmol mol \u03ea1 (Alibert and McCulloch, 1997; Beck et al., 1992; Shen et al., 1996) . If the somewhat higher values of Shen et al. (1996) are ignored (this is a coastal site where the corals are growing in the water intake pond to a nuclear power plant), this converts to a temperature difference of 0.8\u00b0C. On a regional basis, the difference between Sr/Ca seawater for Davies and Myrmidon Reefs in the central GBR (Alibert and McCulloch, 1997) equates to a temperature difference of 0.42\u00b0C. So while there are variations in Sr/Ca seawater that produce a temperature difference of 2\u00b0C-3\u00b0C on a global basis, in most coral reef areas the difference is much smaller, and is within the error limits of the ID-TIMS method.",

In relation to the shelf carbonates, the amount of Sr that is added to the ocean during each glacial event is not matched by an equivalent input of Ca; the latter is immobilized as the stable polymorph of CaCO 3 , low-Mg calcite. Consequently, the removal of Ca from seawater during the ensuing interglacial, in the form of shelf aragonite deposits, will leave an excess of Sr in the ocean because the distribution coefficient (D Sr A ) for corals and Halimeda will maintain the removal of Sr and Ca at a constant rate, meaning that the excess Sr that was added to the ocean during the glacial will not be removed. Over successive glacial/interglacial events this would result in an incremental increase in the Sr/Ca activity ratio of seawater. This does not appear to be the situation, however, because reported Sr/Ca ratios for the last interglacial corals from areas such as the Huon Peninsula and Western Australia are similar to modern values (McCulloch and Esat, 2000; McCulloch et al., 1999) . This suggests that there is some other mechanism for removing the excess Sr during the deglaciation. One possibility is an increase in dissolution of deep-sea carbonate sediments at this time, adding excess Ca and lowering Sr/Ca seawater (Hodell et al., 2001 ).",

This suggests that some or all Ca ions are transported through the coral tissue to the calcifying site by a different pathway than Sr ions (Ip and Krishnaveni, 1991; Ip and Lim, 1991) . Under normal conditions this would mean that the Sr/Ca ratio in the calcifying fluid would be lower than inorganic aragonite. However, Sinclair (1999) has proposed that if temperature conditions become more extreme, the enzymes that transport Ca ions would become less efficient, resulting in a lowering of the active Ca 2\u03e9 transport and a decreasing calcification rate. Because Sr is not affected to the same degree, it would be possible for the Sr/Ca ratio to shift upwards towards inorganic values.",

However, in comparison to the Sr/Ca derived SSTs, ship and satellite data recorded a negative SST anomaly of only 2\u00b0C. At the time it was considered by McCulloch et al. (1994) that the exceptionally cold temperatures of the 1982 winter led to a breakdown of the biological control on Sr/Ca fractionation, and the coral system moved more towards inorganic fractionation. While this conclusion has remained largely unsupported, new and more convincing evidence is provided for a shift in the Sr/Ca ratio, this time at high temperatures, from another coral from Pandora Reef (Fig. 9) . This Porites sp. was sampled soon after the 1998 bleaching event when 87% of the inshore reefs of the GBR were affected (Berkelmans and Oliver, 1999 ). This particular coral shows that during 1997, Sr/Ca ratios declined steadily into the summer of 1997-1998 as the El Ni\u00f1o took effect. This trend was slightly reversed in early January 1998 when a tropical low entered the area, and depressed temperatures momentarily. Subsequently, the Sr/Ca ratio fell to a low of 8.62 mmol mol \u03ea1 as the SST rose to 30.5\u00b0C by early February, but had risen rapidly to 9.13 mmol mol \u03ea1 (equivalent to 21.6\u00b0C) by the beginning of March, after which no growth was recorded (Fig. 9) .",

The Sr/Ca J.F. Marshall and M.T. McCulloch ratio does not appear to be affected until a particular temperature threshold is reached. However, once bleaching is underway, the coral rapidly records an increase in the Sr/Ca ratio as relatively less Ca is made available to the calcifying fluid.

In a study of a coral from Christmas Island in the eastern Indian Ocean (Marshall, 2000) , it was considered that either a decrease in light intensity (as a result of increased macroalgal production) and/or an increase in nutrients might have affected the Sr/Ca ratio because the coral was growing in the same location as a phosphate loading terminal. The stress generated by either could have been enough to affect the transport behavior of Sr and Ca, resulting in an upward shift in the Sr/Ca ratio and hence lower apparent SSTs. In contrast, several corals from nearby Cocos (Keeling) Atoll appear to have experienced stress that resulted in only partial breakdown in the transport behavior of Sr and Ca, although it is obvious that periodically the situation has been serious enough to bring about a complete halt to calcification (Marshall, 2000) . The reports of fish kills and coral mortality, seen from time to time in the lagoon, appear to be a result of algal blooms (Woodroffe and Berry, 1994) . The corals sampled at Cocos are all exposed to open water, so the stresses so evident in the lagoon might only be partially affecting them. However, it is quite clear that corals under stress do not obey the rules.",

Of the 15 calibrations shown in Table 1 , only five are actually based on in situ SST measurements at the actual site itself (i.e., Amedee Lighthouse, New Caledonia and Davies and Myrmidon Reefs, central GBR). The Sr/Ca ratios of de Villiers et al. (1994) were calibrated against an SST station more than 100 km distant. The calibrations of Heiss et al. (1997) ; Gagan et al. (1998) and Christmas Island (Marshall and McCulloch, 2001 ) were derived from blended ship and satellite data. While this may not be as accurate as in situ measurements on the reefs, it does seem to have some veracity. However, the 1\u00b0\u03eb 1\u00b0spatial smoothing does mean that relatively small scale, but significant anomalies, such as related to upwelling as seen at Christmas Island or narrow boundary currents as at Myrmidon Reef, are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy. Notwithstanding these problems, Gagan et al. (1998) were able to derive calibrations from three widely spaced sites that were in very good agreement with each other. One potential method of checking a calibration is to plot the slope of the calibration equation against the intercept. (This idea, communicated to us by both Dan Schrag and Tom Guilderson, is attributed to Harry Elderfield). Figure 11 shows a plot of the 15 calibrations listed in Table 1 together with the seawater value. A linear best fit of the data shows most calibrations lying along the line or within the error limits of the calibration, with only two of the calibrations, that of de Villiers et al. (1994) and Schrag (1999) , offset. The reason for this linear spread in the calibrations, and its tie-in with the seawater value is not immediately clear. The implication is that corals from different localities around the world are responding to their own particular environment or that certain types of environment exert a control on the corals' physiology.",

In fact, there is a greater spread in the calibrations for the five Davies Reef corals than there is for the combined calibrations for Davies, Pandora, Stanley, and Myrmidon Reefs (Fig. 8) . At Davies Reef both Davies 3 and Davies A are small heads. A similar situation is apparent for Holocene corals from Myrmidon and Stanley Reefs (Marshall et al., 2002 submitted) . These produce results that are not in agreement with each other, indicating that the calibration derived from the modern coral is not appropriate to some (or all?) of them. From the core logs it is obvious that these are small heads, probably no longer than 20 cm. The suggestion here is that younger corals produce calibrations that are less reliable than larger, older heads, but why?",

                "text": "At this stage there is no obvious reason, but some insight might be derived from stable isotopes. In a study by Gagan et al. (1996) on supposed enrichment of 13 C during spawning events, the small, 15 year old head of Porites lobata from Ningaloo Reef shows no annual \u2426 13 C variation for some 6 years, and, when it does so, it is out of phase with the \u2426 18 O signal. This contrasts with the top of the larger, 300 year old colony from Pandora Reef, where both the \u2426 13 C and \u2426 18 O produce an in phase annual signal. The inference here is that immature or juvenile coral heads are somehow physiologically different from their more mature counterparts, and this is reflected in their intake of trace elements and isotopes. While this is highly conjectural at this stage, it needs to be confirmed by measuring both stable isotopes and Sr/Ca ratios on a suite of small and large heads which have grown preferably side by side. The reason for suspecting the size (age) of the Porites sp. is that, while in many papers the size of the coral is not mentioned, there is a distinct suspicion that the heads are small and were collected by hand rather than by drilling. In most cases only 1 to 6 years of growth is analyzed. It is significant that of the most seminal and/or critical papers on the Sr/Ca method (i.e., Beck et al., 1992; de Villiers et al., 1994 de Villiers et al., , 1995 McCulloch et al., 1994; Shen et al., 1996) , only one (Alibert and McCulloch, 1997) refers to the size of the coral heads, although the coral from Pandora Reef measured by McCulloch et al. (1994) is the same 300 year old head measured by Gagan et al. (1996) . From this it can be surmized that the lack of agreement for some calibrations (Fig. 10) , compared say to the excellent agreement for the central GBR (Fig. 8) , where only large heads (\u03fe25 years) were cored, is due to the size of the coral. Again, this concept awaits to be tested.",

While Crowley (2000) takes to task other cool SST estimates for the LGM, such as those based on tropical snowlines and groundwater estimates, he refutes coral palaeotemperature-based estimates on the grounds that the calibrations should be derived from a regional gridded field, and must be validated against early 20th century instrumental records. While these may be seen as relatively minor issues compared to those mentioned above, it only applies to \u2426 18 O/SST calibrations and not necessarily to Sr/Ca-based SST estimates (Crowley et al., 1999) . With regard to trace element incorporation into corals, Crowley (2000) maintains that if the SST was some 5\u00b0C cooler, then corals during the LGM would be living under stressed conditions. As seen in the earlier part of the discussion, stress, particularly in the form of high and low SSTs, does result in an increase in the Sr/Ca ratio that can produce anomalously cooler temperatures.",

The only site documented in any detail is Barbados (Fairbanks, 1989) . One has to take into account that sea level was some 120 m lower than present, meaning that many LGM coral reefs would have had to establish themselves on the steep slopes of atolls or on the upper continental slope. While other factors, such as lack of substrate, increased sedimentation, etc., may have been deleterious to reef growth, it would be expected that LGM reefs would have grown in most parts of the tropics if SSTs dropped only by 2\u00b0C -3\u00b0C. This does not appear to be the case. Other areas where late Pleistocene/early Holocene (ca. 10 000 year old) reefs have been drilled, such as New Guinea and Vanuatu, would also be able to support reef growth at \u03ea5\u00b0C, according to Crowley's (2000; Fig. 5 ) estimation.

                "text": "Although the precise determination of the Sr/Ca ratio in corals provides a potent tool for measuring SSTs in both modern and fossil corals, serious doubts have been raised as to its reliability. Much of this stems from the fact that corals are not calcifying in equilibrium with seawater. While corals do not calcify exactly in equilibrium with seawater, their distribution coefficient is sufficiently close, and this disequilibrium appears to be constant at the generic level. It has also been established that corals, through their symbiotic zooxanthellae, can exert a fair degree of physiological control over their calcification rate. While some objection has been raised regarding the reliability of the Sr/Ca method with regard to calcification rate (e.g., de Villiers et al., 1994 de Villiers et al., , 1995 , much of this can be discarded due to poor sampling techniques. Notwithstanding the obvious physiological control on the uptake of Sr into the lattice of coralline aragonite, it is suggested that, provided only a single genus or species is used, and that sampling occurs along a major vertical growth axis, then the Sr/Ca ratio should vary uniformly with temperature. The fact that most of the world's coral reefs occur in low productivity areas would appear to reduce the variability of Sr/Ca seawater to less than \u03ee0.4\u00b0C; well within the error limits of ID-TIMS or ICP-AES. At the temporal level, the modelled loss of Sr from shelf carbonates during low sea levels fails to predict the long term effects of adding additional Sr to the ocean during every glacial event. This would lead to an increase in Sr/Ca seawater over successive glacial periods, but last interglacial corals show no such increase, suggesting that other mechanisms, such as carbonate dissolution during each deglaciation, may be important in maintaining relatively constant Sr/Ca ratios.",

Thermal stress, resulting from either extremely warm or cool temperatures, is considered to lead to a reduction in Ca 2\u03e9 transport to the calcifying fluid, whereas Sr does not appear to be similarly affected, and an upward shift in the Sr/Ca ratio occurs. Evidence from Pandora Reef in the central GBR shows that both excess (bleaching) and extremely cool (\u03fd18\u00b0C) temperatures produce anomalously low Sr/Ca derived SSTs as a result of this breakdown of the biological control on Sr/Ca fractionation.

The fact that tropical LGM palaeotemperature estimates using the Sr/Ca method are 2\u00b0C-3\u00b0C cooler than other climate proxies is a cause for serious concern. However, it is argued here that the overall lack of evidence for reef growth during the LGM suggests that SSTs were too cold in most parts of the tropics for reefs to develop. This would lend support to the idea that tropical SSTs were much cooler than that proposed by CLIMAP data.

Graham Mortimer gave advice on many aspects of the chemistry and mass spectrometry. Chantal Alibert provided unpublished results on Sr/Ca measurements of seawater from the GBR and performed the Sr/Ca analyses from Pandora Reef. Daryl Burrows carried out the original Sr/Ca analyses from the top part of the Myrmidon Reef coral. We thank Dan Schrag, associate editor Robert Byrne and two anonymous referees for their constructive criticism of the paper.Associate editor: R. H. Byrne",

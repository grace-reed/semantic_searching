                "text": "Although copper (I) -dioxygen adducts [3-61 are indicated in the catalytic performance of dicopper complexes, the factors affecting the effectiveness of such catalysts are not well understood [7] . The reactivities of dicopper(I)-dioxygen complexes and dicoppel(I1) complexes with macrocyclic Schiff base ligands were described in previous papers [8--l 11 . For the systems investigated (the ligands of which are shown as 1 and 2 below) it was discovered that, whereas the improvement of catalysis was not dramatic for dicopper complexes of 2 compared with 1 for hydroquinones and phenols, the effectiveness of 2 over for substituted catechols is clear cut. The improved efficiency for catechols is considered to be associated with the internuclear separation of copper ions in the complex [12] . Therefore, the next logical step seemed to be the preparation of a dicopper complex that allows a greater inter-ionic separation. This was attempted in the synthesis of 3, which was expected to coordinate copper in the cavities created by the pyridine and imine functions, thereby producing a greater internuclear separation between the copper ions than previously obtained in dicopper complexes of 1 and 2. Physical studies [13] on the ligand and on the related dicopper complex of the macrocycle (PD),(DIPN), f ormed from the 2:2 condensation of pyridine-2,6_dicarboxaldehyde and 1,5,9_triazanonane have shown that a ring-contracted isomer of the ligand, 4, is obtained as the main product. The dicopper(1) complex of this form of the ligand was prepared and examined for its reactivity towards dioxygen. An oxygenated form of the dicopper(1) complex was studied spectroscopically and this complex ultimately was converted to a mononuclear copper(E) complex. In this report the oxidation of various substrates by the dicopper(I)-dioxygen and dicoppel(I1) complexes of (PD),(DIPN),, 3 and 4, will be described.",

This complex is reduced to the dinuclear Cu(1) complex, 5, by the substrate, and the complex then combines with dioxygen to form the dinuclear copper dioxygen complex with the macrocycle in the ring expanded form. This occurs since the Cu(1) complex must undergo ring expansion in order to form the dioxygen complex. From that point on the Cu(1) and Cu(I1) complexes in the catalytic cycle probably involve only the ring-expanded form of the macrocyclic ligand, as indicated by the Scheme 1.",

In contrast to dicopper complexes of 1 and 2, the dicopper(II) complex of 4 gives a faster initial rate than the corresponding dicopper(1) complex.

Within the group of catechols investigated it is noticed that oxidation was most effective for the more highly substituted catechols, which is in keeping with the findings of Capdevielle and Maumy [ 18, 191 and also Speier and Tyeklar [20] . The ease of oxidation of the substituted catechols is explained by the electronic effects imparted by the substituents. Kinetic studies have indicated that the catalytic oxidation of substituted catechols by copper(B) complexes occurs through the formation of a dicopper-catechol complex [17, 21] which is a precursor to the electron transfer. The stability of this complex and that of the ensuing copper-semiquinone or copper-quinone complex subsequent to electron transfer depends to a significant extent on the nature of the substituents on catechol. Electron withdrawing groups give rise to high redox potentials and high stability of the catechol-dicopper complex [22] . On the other hand redox unstable systems are produced when the substituents on the catechol are electron releasing in nature. When complexes are formed from 3,5-DTBC, an unstable quinone complex is formed subsequent to oxidation, and this complex dissociates to give the products. It is noted that reaction of the quinone with the dicopper complex did not produce a muconate or y-lactone, presumably because of the high redox potential of the product quinone. The electronic effects of substituents are demonstrated as well in the success of conversion of 4-t-butylcatechol as opposed to extremely small extents of conversion for 4methylcatechol since there are more electron releasing groups on 4-TBC.",

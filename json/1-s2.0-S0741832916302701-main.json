Accumulating evidence indicates that P2X4Rs play an important role in regulation of ethanol intake. At the molecular level, ethanol's inhibitory effects on P2X4Rs are antagonized by ivermectin (IVM), in part, via action on P2X4Rs. Behaviorally, male mice deficient in the p2rx4 gene (P2X4R knockout [KO]) have been shown to exhibit a transient increase in ethanol intake over a period of 4 days, as demonstrated by social and binge drinking paradigms. Furthermore, IVM reduced ethanol consumption in male and female rodents, whereas male P2X4R KO mice were less sensitive to the anti-alcohol effects of IVM, compared to wildtype (WT) mice, further supporting a role for P2X4Rs as targets of IVM's action. The current investigation extends testing the hypothesis that P2X4Rs play a role in regulation of ethanol intake. First, we tested the response of P2X4R KO mice to ethanol for a period of weeks. Second, to gain insights into the changes in ethanol intake, we employed a lentivirus-shRNA (LV-shRNA) methodology to selectively knockdown P2X4R expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core in male C57BL/6J mice. In agreement with our previous study, male P2X4R KO mice exhibited higher ethanol intake than WT mice. Additionally, reduced expression of P2X4Rs in the NAc core significantly increased ethanol intake and preference. Collectively, the findings support the hypothesis that P2X4Rs play a role in regulation of ethanol intake and that P2X4Rs represent a novel drug target for treatment of alcohol use disorder.",

P2XRs are fast-acting cation-permeable ion channels that are gated by synaptically released extracellular adenosine 5 0 -triphosphate (ATP) (Chizh & Illes, 2001; Khakh, 2001; North, 2002) . In the CNS, ATP directly mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission by acting on P2XRs located on postsynaptic membranes. In addition, ATP can produce neuromodulator responses by promoting neurotransmitter release of other major ionotropic targets (e.g., GABA and glutamate), known to play important roles in ethanol drinking and other behaviors, by acting on P2XRs located on pre-and postsynaptic membranes (Baxter, Choi, Sim, & North, 2011; Hugel & Schlichter, 2002; Jo & Schlichter, 1999; Khakh, 2001; Xu et al., 2016) .",

In vitro studies report that ethanol concentrations starting at approximately 5 mM modulate ATP-activated currents in neurons (Li, Peoples, & Weight, 1994 Li, Aguayo, Peoples, & Weight, 1993; Weight, Li, & Peoples, 1999; Xiao, Zhou, Li, Davies, & Ye, 2008) and recombinant models (Asatryan et al., 2008 (Asatryan et al., , 2010 Davies et al., 2005; Davies, Machu, Guo, & Alkana, 2002; Xiong, Li, & Weight, 2000 , 2001 . This concentration of ethanol is well below the 17 mM (i.e., 0.08%) blood ethanol concentration (BEC) that is considered \"under the influence\" in the United States. In addition, P2X4Rs are located in brain regions identified as neural substrates of ethanol (e.g., hippocampus, cerebellum, ventral tegmental area [VTA] , nucleus accumbens [NAc] , hypothalamic nuclei including paraventricular nucleus [PVN] , and arcuate nucleus [Arc] ) (Gonzales, Job, & Doyon, 2004; McCool, 2011; Pankratov, Lalo, Krishtal, & Verkhratsky, 2009; Sim et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2016) .",

In agreement with this hypothesis, we recently demonstrated that male P2X4R knockout (KO) mice (i.e., p2rx4 deleted) consumed significantly more ethanol than wildtype (WT) controls (Wyatt et al., 2014) . The present paper extends the investigation of the role of P2X4Rs in ethanol intake and addresses two unresolved questions from the recent Wyatt et al. paper. First, we significantly increased the length of time of the ethanol investigation to gain insights regarding the transient nature of the increased drinking reported by Wyatt and colleagues (Wyatt et al., 2014) . This was accomplished by testing male P2X4R KO mice and WT littermates for changes in ethanol intake and preference for 5 weeks using a 24-h access two-bottle choice paradigm. Second, given that the increase in ethanol intake previously measured in male P2X4R KO mice could partially reflect compensatory developmental changes, we also utilized a lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown strategy (LV-shRNA) to knockdown P2X4R expression in the NAc core, and then measured changes in ethanol intake and preference.",

A separate cohort of mice that had never undergone surgery (to be described as \"na\u00efve mice\") was used as a positive control for this study. After surgery, mice were allowed to rest for a period of 1 week. At the end of the recovery period, the mice remained in their cages for a period of 14 and 42 days, during which they had ad libitum access to food and water. We chose the 14-day time point because the mice are exposed to ethanol 2 weeks post-surgery, and we chose the 42-day time point because the final week during which they receive ethanol is 6 weeks post-surgery. At their respective time points, mice were euthanized using CO 2 asphyxiation, and the striatum was dissected out as per landmarks described in the mouse brain atlas (Franklin & Paxinos, 2007) .",

We used the procedure previously described (Asatryan et al., 2014; Wyatt et al., 2014; Yardley et al., 2012) . Briefly, single-housed WT/P2X4R KO or na\u00efve/LV-alone/LV-shRNA-p2rx4 infused mice had 24-h access to two inverted graduated tubes (25 mL) with metal sippers positioned on stainless steel cage tops. Food was evenly distributed on the cage tops to avoid association with either of the tubes. The mice had access to tubes containing water only for the first week post-acclimation. In the second week, one of the tubes contained water and the other contained 10% ethanol solution (10E). 10E and water intakes were recorded by measuring the lower meniscus. It was ensured that positions of the tubes were switched every alternate day to avoid side preferences. Mice were given fresh solutions of 10E and water once a week. Body weights were measured and used to calculate the g/kg/24-h ethanol intake. Percent ethanol preference was determined by multiplying the ratio of volume of 10E intake (mL) over total fluid intake (10E \u00fe water) by 100.",

                "text": "results in changes in ethanol drinking behavior. Using a global knockout strategy, we demonstrated that P2X4R KO mice exhibited significantly increased ethanol intake. The increased body weights of P2X4R KO mice may partially contribute to their increased ethanol intake, as suggested by lack of a significant change in ethanol preference. On the other hand, there was no significant change in water intake, suggesting that p2rx4 deficiency affects the mechanism of ethanol drinking, without perturbing the physiology of drinking per se. These results are in good agreement with our previous study, in which we showed that male P2X4R KO mice exhibited higher ethanol intake over a period of days without changes in ethanol preference or water intake as compared to their WT littermates (Wyatt et al., 2014) . Taking into consideration the complex compensatory changes that occur in a knockout mouse model, the constitutive deficiency of P2X4Rs does not necessarily represent the full pharmacological blockade of the receptor. At present, we do not have any selective P2X4R antagonists that can be used to provide a direct link between P2X4R antagonism and increased ethanol consumption. As a complementary strategy, we employed a LV-shRNA methodology to address this issue. In the present investigation, we targeted the NAc core as the site for the LV-shRNA injection because this is a critical site of the dopamine (DA) mesolimbic circuitry for various drugs of abuse, including ethanol, to induce their reinforcing and rewarding effects (Bassareo, Cucca, Frau, & Di Chiara, 2017; Cador, Taylor, & Robbins, 1991; Corbit, Fischbach, & Janak, 2016; Di Chiara, 2002) . Moreover, P2X4Rs expression in the striatum (Amadio, Montilli, Picconi, Calabresi, & Volont e, 2007) and endogenous ATP (possibly via activation of P2XRs) have been implicated in modulation of DA neurotransmission in various regions of the mesolimbic circuitry, including the VTA and NAc (Kr\u00fcgel, Kittner, & Illes, 2001; Xiao et al., 2008) . In agreement with our previous and current findings from the male P2X4R KO study, we found that mice with reduced P2X4R expression (via LV-shRNA-p2rx4 infusion) exhibited greater ethanol consumption relative to na\u00efve mice (data not shown) and mice infused with LV alone. There were no significant changes in ethanol intake upon infusion of LV alone in relation to na\u00efve mice, indicating that the increased ethanol intake in mice with reduced P2X4R expression is due to shRNA-mediated knockdown of P2X4Rs and not infusion of the virus alone. The coherence in findings from both the P2X4R KO and LV-shRNA-p2rx4 studies indicates that functional deletion of the p2rx4 gene increases ethanol intake. Nevertheless, considering that there have been compensatory changes in receptors such as NMDARs and a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), as well as DA receptors, in P2X4R KO mice (Khoja et al., 2016; Wyatt et al., 2013) , it is possible that alterations in these receptor systems may occur upon infusion of LV-shRNA into the NAc core. Hence, future studies involving measuring expression levels of glutamatergic and dopaminergic receptors in LV-shRNA-p2rx4 infused mice would be warranted to delineate the interaction of P2X4Rs with other neurotransmitter systems in regulation of ethanol intake.",

The increased ethanol preference in LV-shRNA-p2rx4 infused mice may account for the increased ethanol intake relative to na\u00efve mice, since there were no significant differences in body weights between these groups. Unlike in the LV-shRNA methodology, where there is knockdown of a particular gene at the adult stage, the P2X4R KO mice may exhibit neurodevelopmental adaptations to compensate for constitutive deficiency of the p2rx4 gene, and such adaptations could nullify the effect of p2rx4 knockout on ethanol preference. Moreover, the p2rx4 knockdown is in the NAc core, which is a key brain region for expression of ethanol reinforcement and has an important role in acquisition and maintenance of ethanol-seeking behavior (Gonzales et al., 2004) . Thus, potential neurodevelopmental changes in this brain region of P2X4R KO mice could significantly interfere with motivational behavior toward seeking ethanol. The somewhat differing data with respect to ethanol preference from P2X4R KO and LV-shRNA-p2rx4 infused mice suggests the need for additional investigations using the operant chamber technique to monitor self-administration or conditioned place preference in P2X4R KO mice or LV-shRNA-p2rx4 infused mice, to better understand the role of P2X4Rs in ethanol-seeking behavior.",

For example, Kimpel and colleagues compared gene expression in brain areas associated with reward in inbred alcoholpreferring (iP) versus non-preferring (iNP) rat lines and found that functional p2rx4 expression was significantly reduced in iP rats (Kimpel et al., 2007) . Similarly, Tabakoff and colleagues found lower levels (i.e., an inverse relationship) of whole brain expression of p2rx4 mRNA in inbred rats that display a high ethanol-drinking phenotype, compared to those with a lower ethanol-drinking phenotype (Tabakoff et al., 2009) . On the other hand, McBride and colleagues reported that p2rx4 gene expression was significantly increased in high-alcohol drinking female (HAD-2) rats, relative to their low-alcohol drinking (LAD-2) counterparts (McBride et al., 2012) . In addition, increased expression of P2X4Rs was detected in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a region associated with fear and anxiety (Behbehani,1995) , in adolescent male alcohol-preferring (P) rats (McClintick et al., 2016) . To further validate the correlation of increased P2X4R expression with increased ethanol intake, LV-shRNA-mediated knockdown of P2X4R expression in the posterior VTA was recently shown to significantly decrease ethanol intake in female HAD-2 rats (Franklin, Hauser, Lasek, Bell, & McBride, 2015) . Although there are differences regarding the direction of change in drinking behavior in these reports, a common theme emerging from these investigations is that manipulation of p2rx4 expression is associated with significant changes in ethanol consumption.",

Based on recent work, we suggested that ethanol acts as an open-channel blocker of P2X4Rs (Ostrovskaya et al., 2011; Popova et al., 2010) , and that positive modulation of P2X4Rs by ivermectin (IVM) antagonized ethanol-induced inhibition of P2X4Rs (Asatryan et al., 2010) . Positive modulation of P2X4Rs by IVM can reduce ethanol drinking behavior, as illustrated in previous reports showing that IVM administration in C57BL/6J mice reduced ethanol intake and preference using a variety of paradigms that mimic social drinking and Fig. 3 . The LV-shRNA-p2rx4 group exhibited significantly higher 10E intake as compared to mice infused with LV alone (A). No significant changes in 10E preference (B), water intake (C), or total fluid intake (D) between the groups. Values represent mean \u00b1 SEM for a duration of 5 days for each week for 10 mice infused with LV alone and 14 mice infused with LV-shRNA-p2rx4. *p < 0.05, versus LV-alone infused mice, two-way ANOVA. motivation to seek ethanol (Asatryan et al., 2014; Wyatt et al., 2014; Yardley et al., 2012) . The anti-alcohol effects of IVM can be, in part, linked to P2X4R activity, in that the degree of reduction of ethanol intake was decreased in male P2X4R KO mice (Wyatt et al., 2014) . Similar findings were obtained from Franklin and colleagues, where IVM significantly reduced ethanol intake in male and female HAD-1 and HAD-2 rats. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of IVM significantly reduced ethanol intake in female HAD-2 rats (Franklin et al., 2015) . Although previous findings from our laboratory have suggested IVM as a positive modulator of P2X4Rs, IVM has been reported to be a positive modulator of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) belonging to the Cys loop superfamily, such as GABA A Rs (Dawson et al., 2000) , glycine receptors (GlyRs) (Shan, Haddrill, & Lynch, 2001) , and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (Krause et al., 1998) . Thus, the role of other ionotropic receptors in the behavioral effects of IVM cannot be disregarded. The physiological significance of ethanol-induced inhibition of P2X4Rs within the mesolimbic circuitry is unknown and is currently under investigation in our laboratory. However, based on previous reports, it is thought that ethanol-induced inhibition of P2XRs on the GABAreleasing terminals in the VTA is linked to disinhibition of VTA DA neurons, as suggested previously (Xiao et al., 2008) . Therefore, the study by Xiao and colleagues provides indirect evidence for P2X4Rs's role in modulation of firing of DA neurons in the VTA. One possible mechanism for P2X4Rs in modulation of firing of DA neurons is via its localization in the Arc region of the hypothalamus. P2X4Rs have been reported to be involved in regulating presynaptic GABA release onto proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the Arc region (Xu et al., 2016) . GABAergic activity in this region has been associated with an inhibitory influence on the VTA DA neurons (Tabakoff et al., 2009) . However, additional electrophysiological studies would be needed to test this hypothesis before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Overall, we do not have sufficient data to conclusively state that there is a direct link between P2X4R potentiation/inhibition and firing of DA neurons in the VTA. This is an area of work that is ongoing. Moreover, elucidating the GABAergic tone or firing of VTA DA neurons in P2X4R KO mice or mice that received LV-shRNA-p2rx4 infusion would also be important to help provide novel insights into the mechanism leading to increased ethanol intake in these mice.",

                "text": "While the aforementioned studies highlight the importance of neuronal P2X4Rs in regulation of ethanol intake, the role of microglial P2X4Rs in mediating ethanol-induced responses cannot be excluded. P2X4Rs have been implicated in regulation of microglial function and have been associated with pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative and neuroimmune disorders (Burnstock, 2008; Potucek, Crain, & Watters, 2006; Tsuda, Masuda, Tozaki-Saitoh, & Inoue, 2013) . Ethanol has been shown to upregulate P2X4R mRNA and protein expression in microglial cells, suggesting involvement of P2X4Rs in microglial responses (Gofman, Cenna, & Potula, 2014) . For instance, P2X4Rs have been reported to play a role in mediating ethanol-induced macrophage and microglial phagocytosis as well as microglial migration (Gofman et al., 2014) . In addition, P2X4Rs have also been reported to regulate alcohol-induced effects on signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K-Akt), extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), and transcription factors such as cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) (Gofman, Fernandes, & Potula, 2016) , all of which are linked to multiple physiological functions such as proliferation, differentiation, neurodevelopment, and inflammation (Kim & Choi, 2010) . Interestingly, we observed a significant increase in CREB phosphorylation in the ventral striatum of P2X4R KO mice (Khoja et al., 2016) , indicating a role for CREB activation in P2X4Rs' effects on ethanol drinking behavior. The in vitro findings reported above suggest that alcohol can regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in microglial cells in brain sites linked to reward circuitry. Thus, infusion of LV-shRNA-p2rx4 could possibly lead to perturbation of ethanol-dependent MAPK signaling pathways in microglial cells in the NAc core, as a result of which the LV-shRNA-p2rx4 infused mice consume significantly more ethanol than those injected with LV alone. Hence, the contribution of P2X4Rs to ethanol intake in each cell type needs to be thoroughly examined in future investigations.",

This has proved challenging due to the paucity of genomic data and genetic tools available for corals. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was applied to these species; however, a major bottleneck is the identification and prioritization of candidate genes for manipulation. This issue is exacerbated by the many unknown ('dark') coral genes that may play key roles in the stress response. We review the use of gene coexpression networks that incorporate both known and unknown genes to identify targets for reverse genetic analysis. This approach also provides a framework for the annotation of dark genes in established interaction networks to improve our fundamental knowledge of coral gene function.",

                "text": "Reef-forming corals are foundational species that provide habitats for many marine organisms and offer a number of valuable services [1] for coastal communities, supporting biodiversity worldwide. However, corals are in global decline due to environmental stresses caused by anthropogenic climate change and other local human activities. These stressors can lead to the breakdown of the essential endosymbiosis with dinoflagellate algae in the family Symbiodiniaceae, leading to coral bleaching and death. Due to the ecological, cultural, and economic importance of coral reefs [2] , there is an urgent need to understand the molecular and genetic bases of the coral stress response and bleaching [3] . Consequently, there has been an acceleration in the application of high-throughput single (or multi-) omics methods such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics to study the coral animal and associated microbes (e.g., algal symbionts, bacteria, viruses) ( Figure 1 , Key Figure) [4, 5] . The resulting data have led to many important hypotheses about the roles of genes and pathways involved in stress and bleaching. However, these hypotheses are generally based on correlational data and often derived from complex datasets that contain hundreds to thousands of genes and multiple pathways, making it difficult to identify and understand in detail the key components of the stress response [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Given this situation, several important questions remain in the field. First, which of these genes and pathways are involved in the coral stress response and bleaching? Second, what are the master genetic regulators of these responses? Third, and likely the most important, how will these genetic networks evolve in response to climate change? To address these questions, we need to capitalize on the power of multiomics data to identify candidate key genetic determinants of bleaching, which would then be functionally tested in corals using emerging genome editing tools. This final and key step, which may involve studying the outcomes of crosses or gene editing events, is hindered by the long lifespan of corals and the multiple years that are needed for juveniles to reach sexual maturity.",

Therefore, we advocate a model-systems approach to coral biology where the community selects a limited number of conditions and species to apply a range of multiomics approaches to the holobiont (see Glossary) from genome to metabolome, which will provide the data and capacity to identify key genes and pathways involved in bleaching. An excellent example of this approach is the emerging model system for coral biology, the sea anemone Aiptasia [12, 13] . In this organism, there has been a concerted effort to standardize anemone and algal strains along with experimental conditions, making it possible to integrate omics research across the community [14] [15] [16] . Such an effort should be expended on the development of a small number of reef-building coral models that reflect the extant diversity of these species.",

Disruption of dark genes may offer novel insights into coral biology and identify species-specific adaptations. Another complication of multiomics data is that a large number of coral and algal genes have no known function (i.e., are 'dark'). For example, $33% of dinoflagellate genes lack an annotation and only $1.4% of these unknown proteins contain a known domain [17] . Similarly, in the genome of the rice coral Montipora capitata [18] , $11.7% of the predicted gene models do not have a significant ortholog (BLAST e-value cut-off % 1e\u00c010 against nonredundant NCBI database). Interestingly, many coral dark genes are differentially expressed under stress (see below). In corals, dark genes restricted to single species are relatively small in number but may encode important and potentially coral-specific functions that remain to be studied. For example, with 8279 orthogroups (OGs) shared by all currently available coral genomes, we calculated the numbers of species-specific dark gene groups to be 84 in Acropora digitifera, 479 in M. capitata, and 72 in Pocillopora damicornis. Therefore, although targeting genes with conserved functions [e.g., heat shock proteins, master regulators of the immune response or the unfolded protein response (UPR)] derived from a variety of established model organisms is a key step in validating hypotheses about coral genes, ultimately there is a need to understand the function of unannotated dark genes that may be coral-specific innovations or environmental adaptations.",

In these sections, we also highlight approaches where future research can facilitate the integration of multiomics data both within and between species and across studies. To illustrate the importance of including unannotated genes in multiomics analyses, we present a simple example using existing gene coexpression data including both known and dark genes. Following this section, we discuss the development of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, a reverse genetic tool in corals, potential avenues for prioritizing genes for manipulation, and the need to move beyond multiomics datasets toward rigorous functional testing of hypotheses regarding coral stress and bleaching. We end with a discussion of the significant challenges facing the field of coral conservation, even with the availability of powerful molecular tools to address this problem.",

Proteomes have been generated under bleaching stress in the cosmopolitan genus Acropora. A study in A. microphthalma demonstrated that proteins thought to combat reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by symbionts under damaging thermal conditions were not detected in the coral host proteome, but rather were detected in the proteome of the alga [19] . These authors did not identify effector proteins of apoptosis or autophagy in the host, which contrasts with the common notion that the coral host mediates bleaching via destruction of endosymbionts. Instead, they reported expression of host synaptotagmin, vSNARE, and tSNARE proteins, and posited that A. microphthalma may employ an exocytotic mechanism to eject the symbionts [19] . These results are consistent with the observation in Aiptasia that the vast majority of heat-induced bleaching involves the expulsion of intact algal cells [20] . Ricaurte and colleagues [21] conducted a proteomic study of Acropora palmata during a bleaching event, assessing both bleached and unbleached colonies, and identified 38 proteins exhibiting significant differences. Among expressed and differentially expressed proteins were participants in UV, thermal, and oxidative stress responses, as well as proapoptotic proteins.",

For example, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) performed by Liew and colleagues on Stylophora pistillata revealed that approximately 7% of all CpG sites were methylated, with the majority of these positions located in intronic regions of gene bodies [9] . Notably, this study combined methylation and transcriptomic data to reveal that gene-body methylation was positively correlated with gene expression and that methylated genes displayed reduced transcriptional variability [9] . By contrast, a combination of methylation and expression data was used in Acropora millepora to reveal links between gene expression plasticity and the extent of gene-body methylation [6] . The presence of epimutations as drivers of divergent phenotypes has also been investigated in the Caribbean acroporid A. palmata. Here, a relatively small portion of the phenotypic variance was assigned to variation in DNA methylation linked to microenvironmental differences [25] . The differences between these studies could be due to differences across species, in experimental design, or both. To further test these hypotheses, it should be possible to experimentally modify the epigenetic state of corals using CRISPR/Cas9 by knocking out chromatin modifiers and/or directly modifying the epigenetic state with dCas9 fused to chromatin modifiers [26] .",

Whether similar transmission may occur in other coral species, and the extent to which the transmitted modifications prove advantageous, requires additional physiological and ecological investigation paired with epigenetics. Plasticity that has been transmitted across generations [i.e., cross-generational plasticity (CGP)] has been documented in the larvae [29] and juveniles [30] of the brooding coral Pocillipora acuta. This species is expected to exhibit CGP based on the close connection between parents and offspring during brooding and the high correlation between parent and offspring environment during the rapid settling process [31] , However, to date no epigenetic data are available. It remains a largely open question whether and to what degree coral adaptation to climate changes will involve epigenetic changes. This question has been difficult to answer due in part to the high cost of WGBS. This high cost is driving a search for alternative sequencing approaches, such as methylation-enrichment MeDIP and MBD-seq [24] . In addition, improvements in Nanopore and PacBio sequencing technologies may have the potential to avoid the harsh conditions and high cost of bisulfite treatment while retaining single-base-pair resolution [32] . In the future, the application of coral epigenetic data to conservation efforts may involve 'environmental hardening' originated in the Middle Triassic at least 240 million years ago. Single-guide RNA (sgRNA): an RNA that contains a sequence (approximately 20 bases) that recognizes the gene of interest to be modified along with a tracRNA scaffold that is required to complex with the Cas9 nuclease to confer activity. [27, 30] . This process involves the identification (using epigenetics) and cultivation of well-acclimatized individuals under stressful conditions. These hardened corals could be introduced into natural populations for the long-term goal of propagating selected epigenotypes.",

These studies typically use a generalized linear model to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between control and various test conditions to characterize the animal response to various environmental conditions [7, 18, [34] [35] [36] . This approach has led to many insights into coral biology vis-\u00e0-vis the response to thermal stress [35] and the creation of transcriptome databases to spur coral science [37] . Major DEGs associated with the heat and bleaching responses are transcription factors (e.g., heat shock transcription factor 1 that regulates heat-shock protein expression [18] ), genes involved in the UPR [7, 38] , genes that putatively respond to ROS production presumably by the algal symbiont or the coral host [39] , and genes in various signaling pathways implicated in stress, such as the Ras (small GTPases), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt/protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) families [18] .",

Unlike proteomic and epigenomic studies, there is an abundance of transcriptomic data in coral. These existing transcriptomic datasets make it theoretically possible to conduct metagenomic studies aimed at identifying core pathways. However, even with the existing transcriptomic datasets, it is still often challenging to compare across studies due to differences in experimental design, methods, and/or species studied. One solution would be a concerted community effort to generate multiomics datasets that are as comparable as possible (e.g., by using standardized heat-stress protocols) in a small number of model coral species that reflect the biodiversity on reefs. This type of resource should identify similarities and differences between model corals and will serve as a solid foundation for comparing other coral populations and species.",

A common approach is weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), which quantifies the coexpression patterns among genes in a dataset and can be used to identify clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes [42] . It is also possible to identify regulatory points or hubs in the network that can be assessed with parameters of centrality. These include degree (i.e., the number of connections of one node with other nodes) and betweenness, which is the connectivity of a node between other unconnected node pairs (i.e., the capacity to act as a link), to identify hubs that may act as regulatory components of transcriptional networks [43] . The networks that result from WGCNA are often highly complex, suggesting that they are shaped primarily by natural selection. However, recent analyses suggest that evolutionary drift can also generate high complexity and convergence in transcriptional networks (e.g., mutations in short cis-regulatory sequences can create novel transcription factor binding sites of master regulators across divergent species) [44] . This observation suggests that coral gene coexpression networks, when compared across different species, need to be interpreted with caution because shared circuits may not solely be explained by vertical inheritance of an ancestral plan (i.e., are the result of convergence).",

They noted that larger expression shifts in inshore-native corals transplanted to the offshore site than in offshore-native corals transplanted to the inshore site, and suggested that the offshore corals had less capacity for gene expression plasticity than the inshore corals because the inshore reefs experienced more frequent and higher levels of environmental stressors. The WGCNA analytical framework was recently applied to M. capitata in Hawaii and identified an array of transcription factors that may prove useful for downstream analysis of short-term (1 h or 6 h) thermal stress (i.e., 29.8 C compared with the control of 27.4 C; for details see [18] ) response in this coral.

                "text": "We previously defined dark genes as 'unknown functional genes' that are often coexpressed with genes of known function as a response to environmental (i.e., thermal) stress. Therefore, dark genes are potentially involved in environmental stress-response pathways as enzymes or regulatory factors. We refer to the stress-induced subnetworks comprising both known and dark genes as 'modules' that are identified using gene coexpression analysis. As an example of how gene coexpression networks can be used to identify both known and dark genes for genetic manipulation, we use the RNA-seq results generated by Shumaker et al. [18] in which M. capitata triplicate samples were either maintained in control ambient conditions or exposed to 1 h or 6 h of thermal stress. The significant DEGs identified in these comparisons were used to calculate Pearson correlations of gene expression ( Figure 2 ). The coral animal genes with a significant correlation coefficient (positive or negative) with P-value % 0.05 were used to build the network (see [18] for details). A module (marked with the orange oval in Figure 2 ) that was previously [18] found includes a Tob/BTG transcription factor regulator, the transcription coactivator YAP1, early growth response protein 1, the serine/threonine protein kinase SIK2, and heat shock transcription factor 1, which are all extensively upregulated after 1 h of thermal stress in M. capitata and in many other coral animal hosts, is shown in Figure 3 . Any one of these genes is a potential target for gene knockdown. Specifically, an interesting animal dark gene embedded in the center of this module is marked with an asterisk in Figure 3 and analyzed using phylogenetics in Figure 4 . This tree shows the ancient duplication of this coral-specific dark gene, OG.2649 [18] in the Scleractinia ancestor. Furthermore, several species-specific amino acid changes occur in the targeted conserved region that could confer adaptive traits in different lineages (e.g., amino acids in red text in Figure 4 ). These specific changes in a thermal-stress-tolerant coral species such as M. capitata may be regarded as the products of selection to potentially confer this important trait. We consider this hypothesis to be worth testing using functional tools. This approach to identify targets for genetic manipulation relies on natural variation within conserved gene families [49] [50] [51] . A second example of a coral animal dark gene is shown in Figure 5 that represents a more peripheral member of the transcription factor subnetwork (marked by double asterisks in Figure 3 ; OG.3855) with a complex history evolution among stony corals. This relatively less-conserved protein provides a target for genetic manipulation that may provide important insights into thermal stress tolerance in coral hosts.",

                "text": "It was shown that node degree in a coexpression network is one of the major determinants of transcriptional noise (variance). Although genes in a module may be coregulated, central genes show less expression variance across individual cells, which is likely to propagate less noise throughout the network. Central genes also tend to have more conserved functions due to strong purifying selection. Older genes tend to be central and display more deterministic expression patterns compared with more recently derived, noisy genes [52] . However, younger genes may be targets for selection because their unpredictable expression patterns are responsive to fluctuating conditions, providing a form of bet-hedging [53] . In the context of prioritizing genes for functional studies, it may be important to take into account the position of these target genes within coexpression networks. For example, genes near the nodes might have more severe phenotypes when mutated due to pleiotropic effects compared with peripheral genes. In summary, it is possible not only to identify potential coral-specific targets for genome editing that are relevant to coral stress responses, but also to position dark genes within known interaction networks to aid in their functional annotation.

However, a major limitation toward this understanding has been the lack of genetic tools to functionally test candidate genes and pathways. Despite the difficulties of implementing such genetic tools, the first successful gene knockdown was performed using microinjection of morpholinos into one-cell-stage zygotes of A. digitifera [54] . This strategy was used to study the role of the transcription factor Brachyury during early coral embryogenesis. Although morpholinos are efficient tools to understand gene function at the early embryonic or larval stages, they are of limited use for genes acting later in development because their effects are transient due to dilution and/or degradation during sequential cell divisions [55] . Despite this limitation, this study was an important step forward in coral reverse genetics. Figure 3 . The partial alignment shown above the tree was generated using Geneious and the composition of amino acids in the alignment was drawn with WebLogo as in Figure 4 In recent years, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technologies have facilitated reverse genetics in many organisms [56] . These methods are derived from naturally occurring defense mechanisms that bacteria use to protect against invading viruses [57, 58] . The most commonly used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system uses a target-specific single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that directs the nuclease Cas9 to a specific site in the genome, which then creates a double-stranded break at that position [59, 60] . These double-stranded breaks are often repaired using nonhomologous end joining, which is prone to errors and results in small insertion and deletion mutations at the target site. Importantly, unlike morpholinos, CRISPR/Cas9 can result in permanent and heritable genetic changes in the organism of interest. Recently, Cleves and colleagues generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations in several genes by microinjecting ribonucleoprotein complexes into fertilized A. millepora eggs [61] . Although the initial mutation frequency was low, it should be possible to improve the existing methods to generate sufficient mutations in A. millepora and other broadcast-spawning coral species to perform functional genetics.",

However, because there are over 25 000 genes in the typical coral genome, it is challenging to prioritize genes for functional analysis. This prioritization is particularly important due to the limited availability of coral gametes for experimentation, restricted by their natural spawning times. One potential avenue for choosing targets is to select genes with known and likely conserved functions based on studies in other organisms (e.g., known members of the UPR or heat stress response). This strategy increases the likelihood of generating mutations that result in expected phenotypes but creates a bias against the identification of unknown genes with important roles in coral biology (e.g., coral-specific regulators of the stress response or symbiosis). It is, however, difficult to anticipate the phenotypic consequences of knocking out genes with unknown functions. An alternate avenue is to use the integrated multiomics approach (Box 1) to select known or unknown genes based on their positions in coexpression networks (as described above). This method builds strong correlational support that a particular gene, agnostic to it having a specific annotation, is involved in a particular biological process. For example, prioritizing genes in the nodes of genetic networks that respond to thermal stress may increase the likelihood of identifying key genetic regulators of the stress response. Additionally, this approach will become more powerful as the integration of several types of multiomics datasets becomes possible.",

In this regard, multiomics are rapidly developing bioinformatic tools that are used to integrate multiple lines of high-throughput genomic data and other types of output such as protein-protein interaction networks to explain phenotype [67, 68] .

Thereafter, WGCNA data can be used to correlate the separately generated gene co-methylation and coexpression network [72] . This can be done via pairwise correlations between the representative methylation patterns (i.e., eigengene vectors) of the methylation modules and eigengene vectors of the expression modules. Ultimately, it should be possible to study independently derived networks from each individual omics analysis to identify the hub (or peripheral) genes that co-occur across the different datasets. The metabolome of the coral is likely to be the most informative omics data yet challenging to interpret because, in the absence of coral animal tissue lines, the holobiont will need to be used for such an approach.

As described above, multiomics approaches have and will aid in our understanding of the evolution, function, and regulation of the coral gene inventory, although the lack of robust genetic systems for functional studies has hitherto been a confounding factor. Recent efforts to implement such tools in corals are encouraging. However, a major limitation of coral genetics is the 3-7 years required for offspring to reach sexual maturity. This long generation time makes rearing CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutant coral lines challenging. Although it should be possible to conduct such experiments, current research should focus on tractable phenotypes that are apparent during the early larval or polyp stages. Despite this major technical issue, there are many important aspects of coral biology (e.g., symbiont acquisition, stress tolerance, biomineralization) that can be studied without crosses if the induced mutation rate is sufficiently high to generate completely mutant animals. Furthermore, introducing genetically manipulated (i.e., transgenic) corals into the environment is not likely to be a realistic solution for conservation of the massive populations present worldwide. Rather, these emerging tools are better suited to the discovery of gene functions. These data can provide the basis for more realistic countermeasures against coral bleaching in marine environments. Despite these major issues, coral research must move forward to provide tools, even when using less powerful correlational data, that promote reef preservation. Here we have discussed a variety of omics approaches and some interesting genes (of both known and unknown functions) and pathways that may prove to be useful targets for genetic manipulation. Our approach highlights the integration of transcriptomic data and protein divergence to facilitate gene choice for CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. What are the genetic and/or chemical signals for bleaching? Can we modulate these signals artificially (genetically or chemically) in coral tissues independent of external stress? This approach will help us uncover the molecular and cell biological basis of bleaching.",

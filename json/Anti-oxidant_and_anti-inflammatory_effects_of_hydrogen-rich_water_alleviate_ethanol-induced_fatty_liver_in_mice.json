                "text": "Sustained excessive alcohol consumption results in a spectrum of liver injury, from hepatic steatosis to hepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, which can ultimately lead to hepatocellular carcinoma [1] [2] [3] [4] . Among heavy drinkers, the incidence of hepatic steatosis is about 95%. Risk factors potentially associated with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) include sex, obesity, dietary factors, smoking and non-sex-linked genetic factors. Among humans and rodents, females are more susceptible to ALD, even if they consume less alcohol than males. This may be attributable to lower gastric alcohol dehydrogenase activity, lower distributed volume of alcohol and estrogen, which has a substantial effect on alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity [5] [6] [7] . ALD pathogenesis is mediated by increased steatosis, inflammatory factors, oxidative stress and immune responses. Ethanol (EtOH) impairs antioxidant defenses and mitochondrial functions and may trigger a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus resulting in hepatotoxicity, steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis [1, 2] . ROS can also induce hepatocellular responses strongly associated with Kupffer cell activation, which increases inflammatory response and leads to liver injury. Moreover, activated Kupffer cells release ROS and cytokines that are crucial in activating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and inducing the pro-fibrogenic pathway [1, 2] . Previous studies reported that oxidative stress and sensitization to endotoxins contributing to EtOHinduced liver injury are associated with release of proinflammatory mediators, promotion of lipid peroxidation and impaired hepatic antioxidant defense [1, 2, 8] . Activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB, tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-6 is crucial in ALD progression, which leads to hepatocellular injury and death [1] [2] [3] 6, 9] . IL-22, a novel hepatoprotective factor, is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines and appears to be an important effector molecule of activated T cells and natural killer cells. The main biological roles of IL-22 are to promote innate immunity, improve regeneration and protect against damage [10] . Evidence from several studies suggests that IL-22 -through antioxidant and anti-apoptotic pathways -exerts protective effects against hepatic injury induced by concanavalin A [11] , carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) [12] and EtOH [3] . Ghrelin, a 28-amino acid peptide produced in gastric mucosa, acts in the hypothalamus to promote appetite and inhibit sympathetic activity, thus increasing food intake while lowering metabolic rate [13, 14] . Recent studies suggest that ghrelin has various biological functions, including anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, antiautoimmunity and promotion of vascular health [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

                "text": "Our previous research indicated that electrolyzed reduced water and silica hydride, which contains H2, ameliorated CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in mice by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity and reducing lipid oxidation [26, 27] . Additionally, consumption of more than 20 mL/kg per day of HRW had no observable adverse effects, which suggests a 60-kg human could safely drink at least 1.2 L/d of HRW [28] . Thus, HRW could be used in preventive and clinical applications as a safe and effective antioxidant with minimal side effects [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 23, [28] [29] [30] [31] . Recent clinical studies found that HRW reduced oxidative stress in persons with chronic hepatitis B [32] and metabolic syndrome [31] . The effects of H2 on chronic EtOH-induced liver injury are not well understood. The Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet has been extensively used as the typical approach to establish a chronic-plus-binge EtOH feeding model that mimics some of the molecular and histological features of mild, early-stage human ALD [3, 33, 34] . This model induces mild steatosis and elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in C57BL/6 mice. The elevations are much more severe than those seen in mice on chronic EtOH or single EtOH gavage alone diets. This study investigated the potential protective effects of HRW against chronic EtOHinduced early-stage liver injury and the underlying mechanisms of such effects in female mice after chronic-plus-binge EtOH feeding.",

Our in vivo study showed that HRW pretreatment significantly attenuated increases in serum ALT, AST, TG and TC and hepatic lipid accumulation, which were induced by EtOH feeding. Ghrelin expression was higher after HRW treatment and was correlated with restoration of food intake and inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, which were induced by EtOH feeding. HRW also attenuated MDA level, restored GSH depletion and increased SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activities in liver. Moreover, HRW reduced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels and increased IL-10 and IL-22 levels. These results support the hypothesis that HRW has important antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in alcohol-related disease in mice. Previous studies reported that HRW treatment for 6 wk or 10 wk significantly attenuated oxidative stress and had the potential to improve liver function in patients with chronic hepatitis B [32] and metabolic syndrome [31] , respectively.

Our findings indicate that, as compared with a control liquid diet, an EtOH-containing liquid diet significantly decreases dietary intake and acyl ghrelin level, which suggests that EtOH affects appetite. This finding is consistent with the loss of appetite seen in long-term heavy drinkers. Silymarin, HRW and combination treatment significantly reversed the hypophagic effect of EtOH, indicating that HRW reversal of EtOH-induced anorexia may be mediated by restoration of acyl ghrelin levels. EtOH administration also altered liver weight but not body weight. This suggests that EtOH impairs body composition by means of liver enlargement and sarcopenia [41] , which can be improved by HRW pretreatment. HRW might therefore reverse EtOH-induced effects on acyl ghrelin, which stimulate energy expenditure, thus resulting in loss of muscle mass and hypophagia. A previous study reported that ghrelin has a hepatoprotective role in nonalcoholic fatty liver [9] . In addition, after HRW treatment, acyl ghrelin had a neuroprotective effect in Parkinson's disease [42] . Acyl ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin are both active signaling molecules; however, a limitation of the present study is that we did not measure des-acyl ghrelin. Measurement of the total ghrelin is not a surrogate for analysis of acyl ghrelin [13, 43] . A recent study found that des-acyl ghrelin specifically binds to and acts on a subset of arcuate nucleus cells in a ghrelin receptor-independent manner and antagonizes the orexigenic effects of peripherally administered acyl ghrelin [44] . Furthermore, in a lethal rat model of burn trauma, survival was significantly better after resuscitation with saline containing des-acyl ghrelin than after resuscitation with saline alone [45] . ALD pathogenetic mechanisms are involved in increased steatosis, oxidative stress, inflammatory factors and immune response. EtOH-induced liver steatosis due to ROS accumulation and bacterial endotoxin leakage from damaged intestine triggers an inflammatory response [1] [2] [3] 5, 8, 33] . TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 are widely considered to be the most important proinflammatory cytokines in ALD. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines inhibit musclemass formation and promote fat-mass accumulation, a state that is associated with sarcopenia and obesity [41] .",

A number of studies reported that H2 reduces oxidative stress not only directly but also indirectly, by regulating anti-oxidative signal transduction, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and sirtuin (Sirt1) [14, 18, 20, 35] . Antioxidants regulated by Nrf-2 via an antioxidant response element-driven mechanism include SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), peroxiredoxins, etc [48] . Interestingly, our results indicate that the antioxidant effects of HRW are similar and/or stronger than those of silymarin, indicating that HRW pretreatment protects against EtOH-induced oxidative stress in EtOH-fed mice.",

Ghrelin administration had protective effects against high-fat diet-induced liver injury, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in rats, in part through the action of the LKB1/AMPK and PI3K/Akt pathways [9] . In the present study, HRW-induced alterations in acyl ghrelin were strongly associated with inflammatory and oxidative responses. This suggests that the hepatoprotective effect of HRW in ALD is mediated by acyl ghrelin production, which results in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, future studies should investigate if acyl ghrelin directly regulates expression of IL-10 and IL-22.",

A previous study found that IL-10 was an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits both secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes and/or macrophages and release of free oxygen radicals. Recombinant IL-10 blocks release of ROS [49] . IL-22 prevents oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress in mouse and human cells, where stress is induced by lipids, inflammatory cytokines or environmental ROS via STAT1-and STAT3-mediated up-regulation of antioxidant genes and suppression of oxidative stress-inducing genes [50] . H2 inhibits secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, reduces the severity of intestinal inflammation and improves repair of intestinal cells [51, 52] . EtOH-induced gastrointestinal dysfunction is caused by abnormalities in Kupffer cells -which result in reduced ability to detoxify endotoxins, disruption of intestinal barrier function and increased permeability to endotoxins and bacteria -and bacterial overgrowth in the gut, which leads to excessive generation of endotoxins [8] . Unfortunately, the limited sensitivity of the ELISA kit prevented us from analyzing endotoxins in the present study. However, previous studies reported that H2 alleviated endotoxin-induced liver injury in rodents by reducing inflammation and cell apoptosis [20, 22, 23] .",

AMPK has been implicated as a major regulator of energy metabolism at the cellular and systemic level, which suggests that it has a role in physiological regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Existing evidence indicates that EtOH consumption impairs AMPK-mediated regulation of fatty acid metabolism and results in facilitation of TG and TC accumulation in rodents [4] . By inhibiting AMPK and activating the p38-MAPK pathway, acyl ghrelin inhibits ROS-induced autophagy and cell death [15] . Our previous study revealed that the neuroprotective mechanisms of HRW were mediated via up-regulation of FoxO3a, which stimulated AMPK in a Sirt1-dependent manner [35] . Past and present evidence suggests that HRW inhibits hepatic lipid accumulation through induction of acyl ghrelin, which activates AMPK signaling after suppressing lipogenesis, inhibiting proinflammatory mediators and inducing hepatoprotective cytokines to activate anti-oxidative enzymes. In addition, HRW improved EtOH-induced anorexia via acyl ghrelin secretion (Figure 7) .",

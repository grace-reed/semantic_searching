    "abstract": "Marine organisms have occupied hard substrates since the Archaean. Shells, rocks, wood and sedimentary hardgrounds offer relatively stable habitats compared to unconsolidated sediments, but the plants and animals which inhabit them must develop means to gain and defend this premium attachment space. Hard substrate communities are formed by organisms with a variety of strategies for adhering to and/or excavating the substrates they inhabit. While mobile grazers, organically attached and even soft-bodied organisms may leave evidence of their former presence in ancient hard substrate communities, a superior fossil record is left by sessile encrusters with mineralised skeletons and by borers which leave trace fossils. Furthermore, encrusters and borers are preserved in situ, retaining their spatial relationships to one another and to the substrate. Spatial competition, ecological succession, oriented growth, and differential utilisation of exposed vs. hidden substrate surfaces can all be observed or inferred. Hard substrate communities are thus excellent systems with which to study community evolution over hundreds of millions of years. Here we review the research on modern and ancient hard substrate communities, and point to some changes that have affected them over geological time scales. Such changes include a general increase in bioerosion of hard substrates, particularly carbonate surfaces, through the Phanerozoic. This is, at least in part, analogous to the infaunalisation trends seen in soft substrate communities. Encrusting forms show an increase in skeletalisation from the Palaeozoic into the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, which may be a response to increasing levels of predation. Hard substrate communities, considering borers and encrusters together, show a rough increase in tiering through the Phanerozoic which again parallels trends seen in soft substrate communities. This extensive review of the literature on living and fossil hard substrate organisms shows that many opportunities remain for large-scale studies of trends through time at the community and clade levels. Palaeontologists will especially benefit by closer integration of their work with that of neontologists, particularly in aspects of ecology such as larval recruitment, competition and succession.",

These hard substrates range in scale from coarse sand particles, to vast expanses of lithified seabed. They include the skeletons of living and dead organisms as well as rock clasts. Areas of otherwise barren seabed may be opened up for colonisation by a diverse array of organisms when hard substrates are present. Nowhere is this more vividly illustrated than by the rich communities developing on shipwrecks and other artificial 'reefs' which prove so attractive to recreational divers. Naturally occurring hard and firm substrates lie at the nucleus of many benthic communities, both at the present day and in the geological past. In turn, the skeletal remains of organisms living in these communities are used as hard substrates by other organisms in a process known as 'taphonomic feedback' (Kidwell and Jablonski, 1983) . Hard substrates play crucial roles in numerous marine biological and geological processes, including initial colonisation of the seabed and sedimentation.",

Therefore, it is possible to investigate the living spatial distributions and orientations of organisms from their fossil remains. For example, distributions of species can be quantified relative to exposed and hidden surfaces, and their orientations compared with inferred current directions. Furthermore, the relationships between different colonisers on the same hard substratum can be studied, allowing interpretations of ecological succession and competitive interactions to be made. For example, careful investigation of an encrusted and bored brachiopod shell may yield information on the autecology of the brachiopod, including life orientation, feeding current patterns and symbionts, as well as the sequence of colonisation by borers and encrusters before and after the host's death, their preference for particular locations on the host shell, and how they interacted with one another during life. Hard substrates provide unique opportunities for observing competition between individuals in fossil material and for tracing competition between clades over geological timescales (McKinney, 1995a) .",

The literature on this topic is far too extensive for a comprehensive review and our cover-age is consequently weighted towards our personal interests and expertise in hardgrounds, bioerosion, and bryozoans. We have paid particular attention to related studies on modern hard substrate communities which, although often neglected by palaeontologists who may not have easy access to marine biological journals, offer important insights into processes that must have operated in the geological past, as well as underscoring constraints on the extent to which ancient hard substrate communities can be interpreted. While the present, as always, provides an essential key to the past, the fossil record of hard substrate communities opens a unique window into the longterm evolution of such communities, especially epibionts (Lescinsky, 1996b) , and permits investigation of how they have responded to such important global changes as mass extinctions and the switch between aragonite and calcite seas.",

External shells can be encrusted or bored while the host animal is still alive (e.g., Ward and Thorpe, 1991; Berkman, 1994) . In addition, shell growth around another living organism may lead to embedment ( Fig. 1B) . A living host introduces several elements into the structure of a shell-dwelling hard substrate assemblage. The host may be infaunal for part or all of its life history, reducing the opportunities for colonisation. Some shelled animals are partially infaunal, leaving one portion of the shell exposed to encrustation and boring: Watson (1982) and Keough (1984) discuss Jurassic and Recent examples, respectively. Some animals have an organic membrane over the outer parts of the shell, such as the molluscan periostracum, which may dissuade epizoans by physical or chemical means (Bottjer, 1981) . Some organisms are sessile benthic, providing a relatively stable substrate, whereas others are vagrant benthic or nektonic, forcing any successful colonisers to adapt to movement of the host (see Schmitt et al., 1983; Landman et al., 1987) . Even shells remaining after the death of the shell-producer host can still biotically move if they are secondarily inhabited by another organism, such as when a hermit crab occupies a gastropod shell (Stachowitsch, 1980; Al-Ogily and Knight-Jones, 1981; Brooks and Mariscal, 1986) . We may expect to find hard substrate communities on the exposed portions of shells which had still-living hosts or secondary occupants, but not on internal shells of living animals or on shells of sediment-dwellers.",

The existence of an encruster or boring initiated on an interior surface is a strong indication that the shell producer was dead at the time of colonisation, as discussed by McKinney (1995b) . Dead shells begin to decompose physically, producing changes in the hard substrates available to colonisers. Many aragonitic bivalve shells, for example, lose their external lustre and become ''chalky'' in time after death, producing changes in the substrate which may be expected to attract or repel particular encrusting and boring species. Dead shells are also easily disturbed in highenergy environments and quickly buried under high sedimentation conditions, so hard substrate communities may have only limited opportunities to colonise them. Shells in soft-sediment environments can serve as important ''benthic islands'' for hard substrate communities (Hattin, 1986; Zuschin and Pervesler, 1996; Zuschin et al., 1999) .",

In the marine realm wood can be: (1) living and in situ, as with the roots and trunks of mangrove trees (Sutherland, 1980) ; (2) in situ and dead (submerged forests, for example); (3) floating, and potentially hosting a characteristic driftwood community of encrusters and borers (see Noda, 1981; Wignall and Simms, 1990; Evans, 1999) ; or (4) waterlogged and submerged. Different types of wood will have varying consistencies and resistances to decomposition, producing varying boring and encrusting assemblages. Woody substrates, like shells, also change significantly with time after death. The removal of bark, for example, dramatically modifies the surface available for colonisation. Plant-derived amber is an unexpected marine hard substrate. Nevertheless, several instances of amber bored by pholadid bivalves in marine environments are known (Bandel et al., 1997; Jeffery, personal communication) .

The simplest are rocky shelves and subtidal cliffs, including caves and other cavities with rocky walls. These surfaces remain in situ until broken up by erosion. They are referred to in the literature as ''rockgrounds'' and more broadly as ''rocky shores''. Ecological zonation on modern rocky shores has been well studied (Lewis, 1964) , while Johnson and coworkers have led research on ancient rocky shores (see Johnson, 1988a Johnson, ,b, 1992 Johnson and Baarli, 1999 , for discussion and review). Virtually every major rock type is exposed somewhere in the open ocean. A very important distinction for encrusting and boring organisms is between limestones (primarily calcium carbonate) and other rock types. Limestones can be more easily reduced or modified by chemical means, especially by various borers using acids and chelating agents. Besides chemical composition, the friability of rock surfaces is important to colonising organisms. A loosely cemented sandstone, for example, erodes easily, making an unstable attachment surface. Other rocks may contain high concentrations of heavy metals, particularly copper, which may potentially discourage colonisation. Whereas the majority of rocks are colonised on the seabed, floating pumice can be colonised by corals, pedunculate barnacles and other organisms (Jokiel, 1989; Donovan, 1999) .",

Hardgrounds are most common in tropical and subtropical shallow carbonate environments (Dravis, 1979; . However, they are also known in deep-water chalks and other carbonate oozes (Kennedy and Garrison, 1975a; Bromley and Gale, 1982) . Organisms encrust and bore carbonate hardgrounds much as they would any exposed limestone. Exposed beachrocks are often encrusted and bored, and they are sometimes described as ''hardgrounds'' (e.g., Clari et al., 1995) , but since they are not synsedimentarily cemented on the seafloor, they are better classified as rockgrounds. ''Firmgrounds'' may be precursors of hardgrounds or may remain of intermediate consistency and hence colonisable by both boring and burrowing organisms (e.g., West et al., 1990, Fig. 13 ). Related to hardgrounds are reworked concretions (Fig. 2D ), a subset of which are hiatus concretions showing evidence of exhumation, encrustation and/or boring, followed by burial with renewed growth of the concretion. The complex genetic history of some hard substrates ( Fig. 4 ) offers opportunities for multiple generations of different colonists.",

Encrusters living on these substrates were attached by cementation during life. In modern organisms, cementation is achieved using various organic compounds, including glycoproteins, polysaccharides and mucopolysaccharides (Abbott, 1990; Langer, 1993, p. 243) . However, mineral cements can also contribute significantly to fixation on hard substrates. For example, Harper (1992 Harper ( , 1997 has shown how the crystallisation of spherulitic calcite between the periostracum of bivalves and the substrate binds the shell to the substrate. This 'extrapallial cement' may superficially resemble a diagenetic precipitate in morphology. Some encrusting bivalves switch from organic fixation to cementation during their development (e.g., Harper and Palmer, 1993) . The durability of cementation to hard substrates varies-while some Table 1 Major taxonomic groups of animals containing species with mineralised skeletons that encrust fossil hard substrates Taxonomic group Range (as encrusters) Remarks References Foraminiferans Ordovician -Recent Various genera of calcareous and agglutinating benthic foraminiferans encrust hard substrates. Most are post-Palaeozoic, although it is likely that some problematical Palaeozoic encrusters (e.g., Allonema) are foraminiferans. Loosely attached foraminiferans may also be found (e.g., Cossey and Mundy, 1990) . Table 2 Ichnogenera associated with hard substrates encrusters are effectively bonded permanently to their substratum (and typically remain attached in fossil material), others may fall off before (e.g., Igic, 1984) or after burial and fossilisation (e.g., Walker, 2001, p. 144) . Such loss of encrusters must be borne in mind when undertaking palaeoecological studies of hard substrates. Many invertebrate phyla include encrusting species with mineralised skeletons. These are summarised in Table 1 . Traces of soft-bodied encrusters are occasionally preserved in the fossil record through the processes of bioimmuration (overgrowth) and epibiont shadowing (Section 8.5).",

Alternatively, they may be organically attached using specific structures, e.g., many bivalves are anchored by the byssus and brachiopods by the pedicle. Mussels have byssal threads with sticky tips containing adhesive proteins known as 'Mytilus foot proteins' (Floriolli et al., 2000) . Organically attached forms are prone to dropping-off the substrate during fossilisation but occasionally leave trace fossils indicating their former presence, notably Podichnus produced by brachiopod pedicles (Bromley and Surlyk, 1973) . Instances of organically attached animals being fossilised more-orless in life position have also been recorded (e.g., Richards, 1972; Walker and Diehl, 1985; Harland and Pickerill, 1987; Hattin and Hirt, 1986; Harper and Pickerill, 1996; Peters and Bork, 1998) . Cemented holdfasts anchor many echinoderms, arborescent bryozoans and octocorals to hard substrates; some are provided with diverging root-like prolongations, others having a more simple dimple-or volcano-shape after loss of the erect parts (e.g., Franz\u00e9n, 1977; Palmer and Palmer, 1977; Brett, 1981; Z\u00edtt and Nekvasilov\u00e1, 1993) . There are also numerous instances of organisms which initially cement to small substrates and rapidly outgrow these substrates, as in the case of some corals (Scrutton, 1998) serpulid worms (Savazzi, 1999c) and bryozoans (Rosso, 1996) that adopt free-living or free-lying ecologies.",

The hole left by the boring organism is an ichnofossil, although in some groups (e.g., clionid sponges, ctenostome bryozoans) where the borer remains stationary within this hole, the boring so exactly moulds the external shape of the organism that it has been treated as a body fossil (e.g., Pohowsky, 1978) . In some cases, a body fossil of the boring organism is present within the ichnofossil, especially bivalve shells preserved in the boring Gastrochaenolites. Radtke et al. (1997) provided a comprehensive bibliographical overview of borers and bioerosion, while Vermeij (1987, Table 5 .2) tabulated the taxonomy and geological ranges of mobile rock boring animals.

The combination of grazing and boring can be a potent bioerosional force accounting for the destruction of significant volumes of hard substrates (Fig. 7) .

Most fouling organisms colonise hard substrates via a free-living juvenile or larval stage which develops into the sessile adult through metamorphosis. Larval settlement on hard substrates should be distinguished from recruitment, a term used to describe only those individuals surviving metamorphosis, i.e., settling larvae minus individuals suffering early mortality. Clustering or aggregation of organisms recruited to hard substrates is often observed in the Recent and in the fossil record (Section 8). Aggregation is a pattern which can be produced by a variety of different processes, including differential early mortality of those individuals settling more distantly from others, variations in the surface topography of the substratum which attract larvae to particular areas, limited substrate availability, and active selection by larvae of sites close to adults of the same species. The last of these processes is referred to as gregarious behaviour, a term frequently misused in the palaeontological literature for aggregation arising from any process. Aggregation plays a key role in the formation of certain types of reefs founded on hard substrates (e.g., Bosence, 1979b) .",

Active competition for space commonly results in the overgrowth of one individual by another (Section 6.2). Fossil hard substrate assemblages reveal skeletal overgrowths, some of which may be due to competition between two living individuals, but others to a living individual growing over the surface of a dead individual. Overgrowths are of two main types: (1) lateral overgrowth occurs when two individuals contact each others' edges as they grow across the Fig. 7 .

After Schneider and Torunski (1983). substratum; (2) fouling overgrowth results from the settlement of the larva of one individual on the surface of an another, previously established individual. It may be difficult to distinguish these two types of overgrowth in fossils if the exact point of origin of the overgrowing individual cannot be ascertained, e.g., when the material being studied consists of a section which is unlikely to intersect the precise origin of the overgrowing encruster. Overgrowth may cause the death (mortality) of the overgrown organism or may be non-fatal. For example, overgrowth of the exoskeletal tube of a serpulid worm need not cause death of the worm if the aperture remains open to allow continued access by the tentacle crown of the worm to the water column, and the bases of erect organisms are sometimes overgrown with no obvious detrimental effects on the erect parts (e.g., Fletcher and Day, 1983) . Survival in these circumstances is sometimes referred to by marine biologists as epizooism. Colonial animals typically exhibit partial mortality-death of some individuals (zooids) in the colony but survival of the colony as a whole. Incomplete overgrowth of a colony is a common cause of partial mortality.",

The principle of superposition means that encrusters at the bottom of the pile (i.e., close to the substratum) are older than those above them. Vertically oriented thin sections are often used to reveal superposition sequen-ces (e.g., H\u00f6lder, 1972; Taberner and Bosence, 1985) . The caveat to this method is that underlying encrusters, especially colonial animals, may have continued to live at the substratum surface elsewhere (off the plane of section) and can therefore be partly contemporaneous with overlying encrusters. Consequently, it is more accurate to state that overlying encrusters cannot be older than those beneath (unless undercutting and encrustation of cavity roofs has occurred). Continuing the stratigraphical analogy for borers, these are equivalent to igneous intrusions in that they crosscut the sequence of encrusters. An important difference, however, is that intrusions are normally emplaced from beneath whereas borings tend to penetrate from above, having entered the substrate from the exterior. Nevertheless, the relative chronology of encrusters and borers can be easily determined using the principles applied in geology, e.g., a borer cutting encruster A but covered by encruster B must postdate encruster A but antedate encruster B. Good examples of such relationships between borers and encrusters can be found in H\u00f6lder (1972) and Wilson et al. (1998a,b) . Sometimes alternating layers of individuals belonging to two different encrusting species resemble cyclic sedimentary strata and prove contemporaneity between the species concerned which lived in symbiosis (e.g., Powell, 1991) .",

With such a plethora of possibilities (see West, 1977; Walker and Miller, 1992) , including plurals, adverbs and terms which refer collectively to two or more of the categories, it is hardly surprising that considerable inconsistency of usage has developed, particularly between palaeontologists and neontologists. The terms in common use tend to be compounds of two roots, as in 'epizoan' in which 'epi-' refers to the position (surface) and '-zoan' to the type of organism (animal). Even with such a straightforward term as this, however, there is potential for confusion because the '-zoan' part of the name could signify that either the colonising organism or the substrate it colonises is an animal.

A prefix can be added to indicate the spatial location of the colonist, either on the surface ('epi') or within the substrate ('endo'). A new collective term-sclerobiont-is coined for all organisms inhabiting any kind of hard substrate. The term encompasses encrusters adpressed closely to the surface of the substrate, sessile organisms which are cemented or organically anchored to the substrate surface but grow away from it into the water column, borers which enter the substrate from its perimeter and penetrate to various depths within, and vagile organisms living on or habitually visiting the surface of the hard substrate. Sclerozoans are animal sclerobionts, and sclerophytes plant sclerobionts.",

                "text": "Certain terms commonly encountered in the literature on hard substrates deserve comment. Epizoan is generally used by neontologists, along with the synonymous epizoite (e.g., Hughes, 1979) , for organisms (animal or plant) attached to a living host animal, a habit referred to as 'epizooism'. Palaeontologists have, however, often designated as epizoans organisms attached to demonstrably dead animal substrates, to plant substrates (e.g., Brasier, 1975; De Burgh and Fankboner, 1979; Ivany et al., 1990) , or even to inorganic substrates (e.g., Baird, 1981) . The term epizoobiont here replaces epizoan. Epiphyte is the plant equivalent of epizoan for any organism using a plant as its substrate. It has been used in marine settings for organisms encrusting kelp or seagrasses, and in terrestrial environments for ferns, orchids etc growing on the branches of living trees. Even if the host plant is not preserved, fossil marine epiphytes are occasionally recognisable by the impression (substratum bioimmuration, see Section 8.5) of the host plant on their attachment surfaces. Misuse of the term epiphyte includes application of '-phyte' to the colonising organism rather than the substrate (e.g., Ghosh, 1997) . The term epiphytobiont here replaces epiphyte. Walker and Miller (1992) used the term epibiont for organisms, respectively, fouling the surface of organic substrates and endobiont for organisms boring into organic substrates, regardless of whether the substrate was dead or alive at the time of colonisation. These terms remain useful as long as it is appreciated that they are object-based, 'biont' in this case referring not to the coloniser but to the substrate (cf., for example, Gutt and Schikan, 1998) . However, it should be noted that marine biologists (e.g., Wahl, 1989) typically restrict the term epibiont to organisms attached to surfaces of living hosts. Cryptobiont is a positional term describing organisms colonising hidden surfaces such as concave undersides of bivalve shells or cavities in rocks and reefs. Assemblages of cryptobionts have been referred to as 'cryptos' (e.g., Wood et al., 1996) . Coelobiont is used almost synonymously with cryptobiont (e.g., Kobluk, 1981a) . Basibiont is occasionally used to describe a living substratum hosting a fouling community (e.g., Wahl, 1989; Laudien and Wahl, 1999) .",

                "text": "Symbiosis is a term for any permanent or semipermanent association between two individuals of different species. Because many sclerobionts are sessile, they are prone to forming symbioses with other sclerobionts that colonise the same substratum, as well as with the host substrate if this is a living animal or plant. Symbioses can be subdivided into three types according to the relative effects of the symbionts on one another: (1) parasitism is when one symbiont benefits (often trophically) by living in association but the other loses; (2) mutualism is when both symbionts benefit; and (3) commensalism is when one benefits but the other incurs neither a loss nor a benefit. Biologists measure benefits and losses in terms of either fecundity (reproductive output) or relative population growth when the symbionts are in and out of association. Neither of these measures is available to palaeontologists working on fossil symbioses. Consequently, as discussed by Darrell and Taylor (1993) , when describing fossil symbioses the terms parasitism, mutualism and especially commensalism should be used with extreme caution or avoided altogether. The fossil record can provide good evidence on the antiquity and longevity of symbioses (e.g., Darrell and Taylor, 1993, for corals; Savazzi, 2001 , for bivalves), as well as specificity and obligacy, but not on their overall beneficial or detrimental effects. Specificity refers to the identity of the taxa involved, with a species specific association indicating that only one species is colonised by the symbiont, and obligacy to whether the species concerned is found in symbiosis exclusively (obligate), preferentially (facultative) or only occasionally (incidental). Wahl and Mark (1999) concluded that most marine zoobiotic and phytobiotic relationships were non-obligatory and non-specific. Some symbioses involve a host species transporting the other symbiont, a phenomenon called phoresis (e.g., Lawn, 2002) .",

Some members of these communities possess mineralised-and consequently fossilisable-skeletons. Nevertheless, phytobiotic assemblages are seldom recognised in the fossil record. This can be explained by the typical nonfossilisation of the plant substratum (e.g., Brasier, 1975) which not only means that the nature of the original substratum must be inferred but also that the phytobionts lose their support and are prone to transport and destruction. Adaptations of the phytobionts themselves for coping with the hazard of breaking when the plant substratum flexes include weak or incomplete mineralisation (e.g., Hayward, 1980) , further diminishing their fossilisation potential. Conversely, other adaptations of phytobionts may have potential utility in recognising their identity as epiphytes, e.g., bryozoans with frontal tubercles (Voigt, 1993a) and basal stilts (Voigt, 1993b) . The skeletons of phytobionts found on beached drifts of floating Sargassum contribute significant amounts of carbonate sediment to shoreline deposits in Bermuda (Pestana, 1985) . There is good reason to believe that careful study of some ancient beach deposits may reveal fossils of phytobiotic species. Attachment to floating algae is potentially important in the dispersal of phytobionts at the present day (Highsmith, 1985) and was likely so in the geological past.",

Seed and O'Conner (1981) have thoroughly reviewed the ecology of macroalgal phytobionts. These communities are more common in the low intertidal and shallow subtidal than they are in the high intertidal, their diversity tends to be higher on brown algae (e.g., Fucus, Macrocystis, Sargassum) and red algae (e.g., Solieria, Bryothamnion) than on green algae (Hayward, 1980; Winston and Eiseman, 1980) , and phytobiont abundance is greatest in regions of high water flow and turbulence but low silt loading. Microhabitat differentiation can be evident on individual algal fronds (Hayward, 1980) , with some species of phytobionts recruiting preferentially in troughs or on concave surfaces. Furthermore, zonation of phytobionts along the length of the frond is common, paralleling gradients in frond flexibility, ambient current velocity and age of the frond surface. Brumbaugh et al. (1994) showed that preferential recruitment of the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea to the younger, proximal part of kelp fronds was apparently cued by the relatively undamaged condition of the algal tissues in this region. Because distal parts of fronds are constantly lost by erosion, colonies recruiting in proximal areas could reach an ultimate size three orders of magnitude greater than distal recruits. Low levels of specificity by macrofauna for particular algal species were found in an Arctic fiord by Lippert et al. (2001) .",

Examples of phytobionts associated with these algae at the present day include diatoms and foraminiferans (Freiwald, 1993) . Rhodoliths (sometimes called ''ma\u00ebrl'') are free-living structures formed by non-geniculate coralline algae (see Foster, 2001 , which is an excellent recent review). Rhodoliths are often found in thick beds, and they are distributed through a variety of shallow marine environments, including tropical, temperate and even polar. Some rhodoliths are made completely of coralline algae, whereas others nucleated on hard objects, such as broken pieces of coral, shells, pebbles, or fragments of other rhodoliths (Freiwald and Henrich, 1994) , enveloping the substrate as they grew (e.g., Akpan and Farrow, 1984, pl. 1) . Often more than one species of algae forms the rhodolith framework. Rhodoliths and rhodolith-like forms have a long fossil record, going back as far as the Cambrian (Copper, 1994) , although they are uncommon before the Cenozoic when coralline algae rose in importance. They are useful for palaeoenvironmental interpretations because their shapes can be related to hydraulic energy (Bosence, 1983) , with the caveat that other environmental factors may be involved (Marrack, 1999) . The slow, laminar growth of rhodoliths makes them potentially valuable isotopic recorders of climate change over time (Frantz et al., 2000) .",

Stromatolites are microbial structures (microbialites) with internal laminations; thrombolites are microbial masses with clotted internal textures (Aitken, 1967 ; see also Riding, 1999; Shapiro, 2002) . Stromatolites were especially common on the exposed upper surfaces of intertidal and subtidal rockgrounds in the Precambrian, extending back to 3.3 -3.5 billion years ago (Byerly et al., 1986 ). The bacterial mats which formed stromatolites flourished in the Precambrian, apparently because of a combination of distinctive physical conditions (Melezhik et al., 1997 ) and a lack of grazers (Seilacher, 1999) . Stromatolites today are found only in highly restricted environments, such as hypersaline bays (Seilacher, 1999) . Thrombolites range from the Neoproterozoic (Aitken and Narbonne, 1989) to the Recent (Moore et al., 1984) . They were common in the Cambrian and Ordovician (Kennard and James, 1986) and the Devonian (Shapiro, 2002) , but rarer though present in every other Phanerozoic system. Thrombolites have a much more varied environmental distribution than stromatolites, being found in cryptic spaces such as cavity walls (e.g., Taylor and Palmer, 1994) as well as on exposed surfaces (Riding, 2000) . Phosphatic microbial mats originally attributed a bryozoan origin have been described from the Ordovician by Niedermeyer and Langbein (1989) . Microbial buildups commonly incorporate metazoans which contribute to the overall structure (e.g., Crowley and Zenger, 1975; Pisera, 1996) .",

Criteria for distinguishing between living and post-mortem colonisation are discussed below (Section 5.4). However, it is clear that in many fossils this issue will be unresolvable or at the very least contentious.

Those attached to unmineralised parts of host animals, such as sea snakes and whales (see Key et al., 1995 and references therein), are of less direct palaeontological relevance and will not be considered further. Among marine vertebrates, modern turtle carapaces often host a range of zoobionts, including algae, hydrozoans, bivalves, barnacles and tunicates (e.g., Frazier et al., 1992) . However, loss of the epidermal scutes to which the zoobionts are attached would jeopardise any potential fossil record of in situ turtle zoobionts (encrusting oysters and echinoid grazing traces (Gnaathichnus) have been recorded as post-mortem associates on Jurassic turtle carapaces by Meyer, 1994) . Ephemeral substrates, including tunicates, sponges and octocorals, support rich and diverse assemblages of zoobiotic bryozoans off southern Australia (Hageman et al., 2000) . Such substrates do not usually survive into the fossil record but the basal attachment structures of the bryozoans involved may provide diagnostic evidence of their former presence.",

Colonisation by zoobionts and phytobionts, however, is not always disadvantageous to the host (Wahl, 1989) and in some instances their presence is actively encouraged by host behaviour (e.g., decorator crabs) or morphology (e.g., the bivalve Spondylus, see Section 5.3.2). Here, the presence of a fouling community may function in defence of the host against predators. From a palaeontological perspective, such beneficial interactions serve to underscore the danger of concluding that zoobionts are necessarily a burden to the living host and therefore parasitic.",

Mapping of seven species of foraminiferans encrusting the Floridian brachiopod Tichsina floridensis by Zumwalt and Delaca (1980) revealed a concentration close to the commissure but statistically indistinguishable numbers in the inhalant and exhalent areas of the host (Fig. 9) . Consequently, although feeding by the foraminiferans may benefit from increased current velocities and particle flux near the brachiopod commissure, there is no evidence of food poaching. Barnes and Clarke (1995) have described mainly sponges, bryozoans and polychaetes encrusting the Antarctic brachiopod Liothyrella uva. The area covered by these zoobionts increased from less than 20% on the smallest to more than 50% on the largest hosts, and species richness also increased with brachiopod size, while the average area of shell encrusted decreased slightly with depth of collection. These high coverage values were attributed to the long lifespan of the host brachiopods. Some evidence was found of encrusting bryozoans growing across the commissure, blocking feeding, and apparently causing brachiopod mortality.",

The diversity and density of these 'molluscobiotic communities' varies according to host species and environment. Among bivalves, oysters and scallops are particularly prone to biofouling, and this can be a major problem for commercial shellfisheries (e.g., Korringa, 1954; Igic, 1972; Thangavelu and Sanjeevaraj, 1988) , especially through the shell weakening effects of boring sponges and spionid polychaetes. While the periostracum of the mollusc shell is known or believed to deter fouling in some species (Bottjer, 1981) , damage to this often thin organic covering is common and may account for the existence, for example, of heavily fouled individ-uals of the gastropod Astraea heliotropium on the Otago Shelf, New Zealand (PDT, personal observation). As with other sclerobiotic communities (see Section 6.1), nutrient levels have been hypothesised to play an important role in determining the degree of fouling of living molluscs (Voight and Walker, 1995) .",

Observations of in situ Mytilus edulis showed that unfouled shells were preferred as prey by the starfish Asterias rubens, with shells fouled by hydrozoans and algae better protected against predators than barnacle-fouled shells (Laudien and Wahl, 1999) . Conversely, zoobionts on mussels (M. edulis and M. californianus) can increase drag forces and therefore lead to dislodgment and death (Witman and Suchanek, 1984) . A dramatic illustration of the effect of frondose algae on living host substrates is the report by Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2001) of the stranding of more than two million individuals of the scallop Agropecten on a Chilean beach in March 1999. The stranding took place during a period of strong wave action and was facilitated by the algae which increased the probability of dislodgement. However, such catastrophic effects may only apply to large zoobionts such as kelp and barnacles; zoobionts which do not increase vertical relief appreciably may have no appreciable influence on dislodgement. Another study (Laihonen and Furman, 1986) found that encrustation by barnacles had no significant effect on the growth rate of M. edulis. The barnacles themselves, however, grew faster on living than on dead shells, suggesting a commensal relationship with the host mussel.",

Sponge encrustation protects the bivalve from predation by starfish, probably by reducing the adhesion of the tube feet, and the sponge in return is protected from predatory nudibranchs by the mobility of the swimming mollusc (Pond, 1992 ; see also Bloom, 1975) . Another scallop (Chlamys varia) is encrusted by a different, much larger sponge (Halichondria) which also hinders starfish predation, in this case not only through its effects on tube foot adhesion but also by making the valve margins almost inaccessible beneath the enveloping sponge (Forester, 1979) . There is also speculation that sponges encrust-ing scallops provide additional predator deterrence as a result of their toxicity, while crellid sponge encrustation of Chlamys asperrima apparently prevents endolith infestation and allows the scallop to secrete a thinner shell than that found in individuals lacking a sponge covering (Pitcher and Butler, 1987) . Survival in natural habitats of sponge-encrusted individuals of C. asperrima has been shown to be greater than unencrusted individuals (Chernoff, 1987) . Individuals of the Antarctic scallop Adamussium colbecki are often encrusted by the hydroid Hydractinia angusta which can eat the tube feet and pedicellariae of echinoids grazing algae on the shell surface. The hydroid may thereby limit the damage caused to the shell of its host by grazing (Cerrano et al., 2000) .",

Conversely, fouling by the bryozoan Alcyonidium of another gastropod, the whelk Burnupena papyracea, has a beneficial effect on the host, protecting it from predation by rock lobsters (Barkai and McQuaid, 1988) . Cerith gastropod shells from seagrass meadows in Brazil are rarely colonised by zoobionts when empty, whereas shells of living gastropods and shells occupied by hermit crabs are more often colonised, the former usually by oysters and the latter by polychaetes (Creed, 2000) . Shells of living molluscs can provide rare hard substrates on muddy seabeds for corals and other sclerobionts (e.g., Nishihira, 2001 ). Shells of living Nautilus often support zoobiotic communities (Landman et al., 1987) , with up to 92% of shells colonised, although the low surface coverage ( < 1%) is not thought to present a significant problem for the host cephalopod. Among the commonest encrusters are bryozoans, foraminiferans, serpulids, barnacles and the tubular scyphozoan Stephanoscyphus. Whereas bryozoans are the principal zoobionts on N. belauensis, serpulids dominate on two other species, N. pompilius and N. scrobiculatus. The umbilicus appears to be the preferred site of colonisation, possibly because of the high flow into this region of water containing entrained larvae and planktonic food particles when the animal is swimming. The black area and apertural margin are generally free of zoobionts, as might be predicted given the presence of soft tissues here, and the thick periostracum of N. scrobiculatus seemingly deters zoobionts. Colonisation of live animals contrasts with that seen in drift shells where density of encrustation may be much greater and distributions more random.",

Many of these zoobionts must become submerged in the sediment when the crabs burrow during rest periods, although the barnacles may occupy an elevated position on the crown of the carapace. Several studies-most recently Key et al. (2000) and Patil and Anil (2000) -have found greater encrustation of male than female individuals of the horseshoe crab Tachypleus gigas, possibly because females spend more of their time burrowing, including egg laying. Encrusting bryozoans are more common in this species on the dorsal than the ventral surface, and on the prosoma than the opisthosoma. Whereas 77% of T. gigas individuals were found by Key et al. (1996) to be bryozoan-encrusted, another horseshoe crab (Carciinoscorpius rotundicauda) from Singapore was unfouled, a pattern attributed to the fact that the second species spends more time in brackish waters. A detailed analysis (Dietl et al., 2000) of the zoobionts on Limulus polyphemus showed that different taxo-nomic groups had very different patterns of distribution. This was explained by variations in larval settlement behaviour often influenced by current flow over the crab's body. Few zoobionts were present on smooth-surfaced areas prone to abrasion during movement of the host through sediments. Apertures of the serpulid worm Filograna are predominantly oriented posteriorly, facing into a zone of current eddies which may have facilitated their ability to capture food particles.",

Because they are unable to maintain tenanted shells in the same way as an animal secreting its own shell, a very different and frequently dense and diverse community of zoobionts may live in association with hermit crabs, some species encrusting the shell surface, some boring into the shell and yet others cohabiting the shell lumen with the hermit crab (e.g., Jensen and Bender, 1973; Stachowitsch, 1980) . 'Pagurized' shells occupied by hermit crabs show several characteristic features (Walker, 1988 (Walker, , 1992 (Walker, , 1995 . These include massive encrustation ( Fig. 11) extending evenly over the external shell surface and into the shell interior, the presence of distinctive zoobionts in the region of the shell aperture, and abrasion marks ('pagurid facets') on the base of the shell caused by dragging along the substratum. Communities colonising hermitted shells may be more diverse than those on vacant shells (Fig. 12 ). This is because the crabs prevent shells from being buried and hence allow a greater time for the fouling community to develop (Conover, 1979) . In some instances, tangible benefits have been demonstrated for both the hermit crabs and its symbionts. For example, the stinging cells of sea anemones and hydroids living on hermitted shells protect the crabs from predatory octopus (e.g., Brooks and Mariscal, 1985) , while by living with a hermit crab the anemones and hydroids receive protection from attacks by echinoids and polychaetes (Brooks and Gwaltney, 1993) , i.e., the symbiosis is mutualistic. However, another study (Buckley and Ebersole, 1994) showed that the presence of symbiotic hydroids actually increased the vulnerability of hermit crabs to predation by blue crabs.

Sometimes a single phytobiont or zoobiont monopolises the entire surface of the substrate provide by the hermitted shell. In such cases, the symbiont may not only produce a very thick encrustation which strengthens the shell, but can also grow outwards from the shell aperture in the form of a helicospiral tube, mimicking the shape of the gastropod shell and providing an enlarged chamber for the hermit crab to occupy (Taylor, 1996) . Modern examples of this type of symbiont are known among coralline red algae (Zuschin and Piller, 1997) , sponges (Sandford and Kelly-Borges, 1997) , hydrozoans (Cairns and Barnard, 1984) and bryozoans (Taylor, 1994) (Fig. 11) . It has been hypothesised that these bulky symbionts benefit the hermit crab by protecting it against various types of predators as well as removing the necessity for shell exchange as the crab outgrows its home. Key and Barnes (1999) investigated fouling of Antarctic Glyptonotus antarcticus, a large marine isopod of particular interest as a trilobite analogue. Just under half of the individuals in their sample were fouled by bryozoans and/or serpulids, with as many as 12 bryozoan colonies per host isopod. No significant differences were found between encrustation of dorsal and ventral surfaces but fouling was greater on particular parts of the host, especially the fused pleon and telson. Bryozoans evidently use their isopod hosts as a refuge from the ice scour that renders rock surfaces in these shallow water habitats a less attractive option as a substrate.",

A colonial lifestyle with its inherent plasticity in growth and form, together with the incidence of partial mortality, especially in older parts of colonies where a 'dead zone' or necromass may be developed, explains the widespread colonisation of colonial corals by zoobionts. Plasticity allows for zoobionts to be accommodated within the structure of the colony, while partial mortality permits zoobionts to overgrow or bore into individual corallites or groups of corallites without bringing about death of the colony as a whole.",

                "text": "A cool-water, solitary scleractinian coral-Caryophyllia-commonly attaches to the calcareous tubes of the free-living polychaete Ditrupa (Wilson, 1976) . The majority of corals settle on the concave side of the curved tube, at first living symbiotically with the host but ultimately killing the host as the weight of the coral forces the tube into the sediment and buries the tube aperture. However, the coral itself survives while the tube progressively disintegrates through the action of boring algae and fungi. Harmelin (1990) described two solitary scleractinian corals from Mediterranean caves which become fouled and overgrown by sponges, bryozoans and serpulids but are able to extend their tissues basally to envelop these epizoans in new skeleton (Fig. 13 ). Likewise, healthy, active parts of the deep-water colonial coral Lophelia are able to respond to fouling organisms by enveloping them in layers of sclerenchyme, whereas older and inactive parts of colonies acquire a biofilm associated with Fe -Mn precipitation and host a diverse zoobiotic community of encrusters and borers (Freiwald and Wilson, 1998 ). Stebbing's (1971) study of the zoobionts ('epizoites') of the seaweed-like bryozoan Flustra from Wales demonstrated zonation of species along the flattened branches of the host, with some zoobionts apparently favouring the basal (oldest) parts of branches and others the terminal (youngest) parts. Modern bryozoans with large, erect colonies can support very high diversities and biomasses of zoobionts (e.g., Rao and Ganapati, 1980; Bradstock and Gordon, 1983) . These are frequently concentrated in the basal parts of colonies, regions which may constitute inactive necromass or be exoskeletal and hence vulnerable to colonising zoobionts. Similarly, Barnes (1994) found zoobionts to be significantly commoner on the rear, exoskeletal surfaces of two Antarctic bryozoan species. He also demonstrated differences in species composition of the zoobiotic community between: (1) the front and rear surfaces; (2) the two host species; and (3) according to depth, with the area colonised by zoobionts being a factor of six or more greater in shallow (40 m) than deep water (150 m). A detailed study of the spatial distributions of epibionts colonising the branches of the erect, articulated bryozoan Cellaria in the Adriatic Sea was undertaken by McKinney and Jaklin (2000) . Young (distal) branches were found to be characterised by foraminiferans, algae and sponges, intermediate branches by hydroids, annelids, ctenostome bryozoans and ascidians, and old (proximal) branches by cheilostome and cyclostome bryozoans. Larval settlement behaviour may be responsible for at least some of this patterning. The sessile vermetid gastropod Serpulorbis squamigerus recruits preferentially onto the surfaces of encrusting cheilostome bryozoans belonging to several species in southern California (Osman, 1987) . While the gastropods may obtain benefit during early growth stages from the bryozoans in the form of camouflage against predators and a refuge from competitors for space, no measurable disadvantage could be detected for the fouled bryozoans.",

Distinguishing between life and postmortem skeletobiotic associations has been a major focus of many palaeoecological studies. Several criteria with varying degrees of certainty can be used to infer whether colonisation occurred before or after death of the host (see Holland, 1971; Lescinsky, 1995) .

For example, Palmer and F\u00fcrsich (1981) identified more than 40 species encrusting the Middle Jurassic sponge Platychonia magna from a reef in Normandy, France. Palaeozoic stromatoporoids commonly served as hard substrates for bryozoans, 'worms', cemented brachiopods, corals and crinoids, and often contain the boring Trypanites (e.g., Kershaw, 1980; Nield, 1986b; Copper, 1996; Lebold, 2000; Figs. 2C and 14) . The undersides of Carboniferous chaetetid sponges may host cryptic skeleto- bionts, including cemented brachiopods (Sinuatella), bryozoans, foraminiferans, Spirorbis, and the borings Caulostrepsis and Rogerella (Suchy and West, 1988; Brunton and Mundy, 1988 ).",

Arborescent bryozoans were also utilised as substrates by organically attached skeletobionts (e.g., Richards, 1972; Harper and Pickerill, 1996) . According to Thomsen (1977) , encrusting bryozoans from Danian mounds in Denmark preferred to attach to erect bryozoans with smooth rather than ridged surfaces. Pozaryska and Voigt (1985) made a detailed study of fistulose foraminiferans attached to erect and vagile bryozoans of Upper Cretaceous and Palaeocene age. They concluded that attachment could occur to both dead and living bryozoans, the foraminiferans benefiting from the provision of a sheltered substrate in high-energy environments.",

A related study (Bordeaux and Brett, 1990) showed substrate specificity for particular brachiopod taxa by skeletobionts: brachiopods having non-punctate shells without spines or frills were found to be the most heavily encrusted. Alexander and Scharpf's (1990) detailed study of encrusters on Ordovician brachiopods from the Dillsboro Formation of Indiana also demonstrated substrate selectivity, with punctate and coarsely ribbed brachiopods being less favoured by at least some species of epibionts. In common with some other studies, species of large brachiopods were found to be more often encrusted than small species. Surface area considerations as well as host longevity can often explain this kind of pattern.",

This has been taken to indicate that the incurrents of the brachiopod, potentially of benefit to the cornulitid, approached the shell laterally rather than medially (Peters, 1995) .",

Relative chronology is given by the observation that the bryozoans sometimes overgrew the borings, but were more often cut by them. Platyceratids from the Ordovician of Cincinnati were fouled by cornulitids during life, as indicated by reciprocal overgrowth (Morris and Felton, 1993) , and some also appear to have barnacle borings (Felton, personal communication).",

                "text": "Fossil cephalopods with external shells occasionally support sclerobionts which either colonised the shells while the host animal was alive or after it died. A good example of inferred life associations occurs between the Ordovician -Devonian orthoconic nautiloids and colonial bryozoans (notably Spatiopora), problematica (Reptaria) and corals (Alveolites) described by Baird et al. (1989) . Distinct orientation patterns, with apertures pointing forwards, may be present in Reptaria colonies encrusting nautiloids. Orthoconic nautiloids from the Ordovician of South Africa were colonised by inarticulate brachiopods and cornulitids (Gabbott, 1999) , and Prokop and Turek (1983) described a Silurian orthocone with no fewer than 17 attached crinoids. An unusual example of a hydrozoan (Delheidia) totally enveloping a small nautiloid was described from the French Miocene by Lozouet and Maestrati (1992) . It is unclear whether this represents growth on a dead but floating shell, or on a shell that had rolled along the seabed. Merkt (1966) has described Jurassic ammonites fouled by oysters and serpulids on one side and evidently responding by adjusting the trajectory of shell growth in order to maintain a vertical attitude in the water column. A Triassic Ceratites studied by Meischner (1968) was colonised by the cemented bivalve Placunopsis in several phases, partly while the ammonoid was still alive and partly after death. Seilacher (1982) has argued that ammonites and nautiloids from the Early Jurassic Posidonia Shale of Germany were colonised by sessile organisms both when the host animal was alive, and while the dead shell was floating in a vertical orientation. This view contrasts with Kauffman's (1981) interpretation of the same material as representing benthic islands colonised on a muddy sea floor. Support for Kauffman's hypothesis is from ammonites bearing encrusters on one side only (the upper side). A comparable problem of benthic vs. planktonic colonisation is posed by spheroidal colonies of the ?hydrozoan Parkeria from the mid-Cretaceous which totally envelop ammonite substrates (Wilmsen, in preparation). This is well seen in the magnificent illustrations of Carpenter and Brady (1869) who, however, regarded Parkeria as an arenaceous foraminiferan and the ammonite substrate as the early chambered test. Some Upper Cretaceous ammonite shells bear the 'home scars' of limpets that apparently colonised living host animals (Kase et al., 1994 (Kase et al., , 1998 , and fed on algae growing on the shell surface, leaving grazing traces (Radulichhnus). The clearest examples of entirely post-mortem colonisation of fossil cephalopods can be seen when moulds rather than shells themselves are encrusted and bored (e.g., Macchioni, 2000) . Post-mortem boring and grazing of ammonites and nautiloids has been well described in a Maastrichtian fauna from Western Australia (Henderson and McNamara, 1985) , and in Jurassic faunas in Tunisia (Rak\u00fas and Z\u00edtt, 1993) and Italy (Nicosia, 1986) .",

Marek and Galle's (1976) study of the Devon-ian hyolith Pterygotheca from the Czech Republic provides the best example. Most specimens of Pterygotheca have their more convex sides covered by a tabulate coral, Hyostragulum. The presence of this life associate led Marek and Galle to interpret hyoliths as sedentary animals which rested with the convex side of the shell uppermost (dorsal). Specificity of encrustation of Hyolithes by prasoporid bryozoans has also been observed in the Ordovician Trenton Group of New York and Lexington Limestone of Kentucky (Brett, personal communication, 2002) .",

For example, Taylor and Brett (1996) described articulated examples of the Silurian trilobite Arctinurus with the dorsal exoskeleton colonised by microcommunities of small encrusters and pedically attached brachiopods that apparently associated with the living trilobite. Brandt (1996) found that encrustation on a sample of Flexicalymene from the Cincinnati area occurred only on the largest trilobites which probably represent individuals in their terminal moult stage. Schumacher et al. (1998) , working with the same Ordovician trilobite genus, interpreted as symbionts some encrusting bryozoans, cornulitids and inarticulate brachiopods, with ramose bryozoan colonies seemingly taking advantage of the feeding currents of the host. Small crinoid holdfasts and an inarticulate brachiopod were found attached to a fragmentary specimen of Selenopeltis (Budil and Saric, 1995) and bryozoans to the exuvia of Dalmanitina (K\u00e1cha and Saric, 1995) , both from the Ordovician of Bohemia, while the bryozoan Corynotrypa has been described encrusting a cephalon of the trilobite Calyptaulax from the Irish Ordovician (Clarkson and Tripp, 1982) .",

In the case of stem encrustation, a life association can sometimes be inferred by symmetrical growth of the fouling organism around the entire circumference of the stem (Hudson et al., 1966; Brett and Eckert, 1982; Peters and Bork, 1998; Wyse Jackson et al., 1999) , indicating that the stem was upright when fouled. For example, Hudson et al. (1966) described columnals of Irish Carboniferous crinoids encrusted circumferentially by two tabulate corals (Cladochonus and Emmonsia) which lived attached to the stems of the living hosts. On the other hand, encrustation of articulation facets points to postmortem association (e.g., Rak\u00fa s and McGee and Watkins, 1994; Feldman and Brett, 1998) .

Most apparently represent post-mortem colonisation, although the robust spines of regular echinoids can become densely encrusted while the host animal is still alive. A significant proportion of irregular echinoids in the Upper Cretaceous Chalk of northwest Europe, especially the genus Echinocorys, is encrusted by bryozoans, sponges, foraminiferans, serpulids, bivalves and craniid brachiopods (e.g., Schmid, 1949; M\u00fcller, 1969; Cross and Rose, 1994) . As the host echinoids were infaunal during life, tests bearing skeletobionts had to be exhumed onto the seabed and colonised before disarticulation. Vermeij (1987) used the term conchicole to refer to animals inhabiting empty shells, particularly of gastropods. The best-known conchicoles at the present day are hermit crabs, although several other groups have also been recorded living in mollusc shells (see Vermeij, 1987, Table 8 .1). The fossil record of in situ hermit crabs and other conchicoles is meagre; however, inhabited gastropod shells may support distinctive assemblages of skeletobionts which are of value in showing: (1) that the shell was occupied by a conchicole and was not vacant or still inhabited by the gastropod maker; and (2) the likely taxonomic identity of the conchicole.",

Massive encrustations distributed evenly over surfaces of fossil gastropod shells have been recorded back to the early Palaeozoic. Examples are found among hydrozoan cnidarians (Allman, 1872; Douvill\u00e9, 1908; Olivero and Aguirre-Urreta, 1994) , anthozoan cnidarians (Kase, 1986; Darrell and Taylor, 1989) and bryozoans (e.g., Buge and Fischer, 1970; McNamara, 1978; Morris et al., 1991; Aguirre-Urreta and Olivero, 1992; Taylor, 1994; Kidwell and Gyllenhaal, 1998) . By analogy with modern symbioses between bryozoans and gastropods or between bryozoans and hermit crabs (see Taylor, 1994, p. 168) , those examples in which the encruster either grows over the lips of the gastropod shell and onto internal surfaces normally covered by mantle tissue when the gastropod is alive, or extends outwards from the aperture to form a helicospiral tube-like extension to the gastropod living chamber, are likely to have been tenanted by a conchicole. Given the dominance today of hermit crabs as conchicoles, coupled with the fact that hermit crab body fossils range back to the Lower Jurassic, there is a reasonable probability that any post-Triassic examples of such encrusters will have been hermit crab symbionts. Supporting evidence for symbiosis with a hermit crab is sometimes available from the knowledge that modern examples of the same taxa are obligate hermit crab symbionts (e.g., the bryozoan Akatopora circumsaepta in New Zealand, see Taylor, 1994) , from the occurrence of other associates (especially the trace fossil Helicotaphrichnus, see below), and wear facets on the base of the shell caused by dragging (e.g., Palmer and Hancock, 1973; Kidwell and Gyllenhaal, 1998) . For Palaeozoic examples, the identity of the conchicole/s is unclear, although other groups of arthropods and worms, including sipunculans, are likely candidates (e.g., Morris et al., 1991) .",

In part, this is not only because of their economic significance (e.g., as sources of commercial shellfish) but also because hard substrates, particularly in the intertidal, have formed important experimental sites for ecological studies of recruitment and community succession (Underwood, 2000) . It is impossible here to do justice to the work on modern hard substrate ecology. Rather, we focus on aspects having a bearing on palaeoecological studies of fossil hard substrates, giving a few examples to illustrate these points. An important lesson to be learned from the Recent is that a myriad of physical and biological factors influence the development of modern hard substrate communities, some fairly predictable in their effects but others more obscure. Not only are many of these factors 'invisible' to the palaeoecologist, but complex interactions between individual factors may render it impossible to infer the processes that actually structured ancient hard substrate communities. Some appreciation of the ecology of modern hard substrates is absolutely essential for palaeontologists embarking on studies of ancient hard substrates.",

As already mentioned above (Section 3), the term recruitment refers to the organisms which survive immediate post-settlement mortality (see Keough and Downes, 1982; Osman and Whitlatch, Fig. 16 . Bimonthly averages (logarithmic scale) of larval abundance of Membranipora membranacea plus recruited colony densities of this bryozoan on the kelp Macrocystis pyrifera in California. After Yoshioka (1982) . 1995), potentially becoming established in the community. Because individuals suffering such early mortality are rarely fossilised, studies on ancient hard substrate communities effectively deal with recruits and recruitment patterns rather than settlers and settlement patterns. The significance of recruitment to subsequent community development and structure is evident in such studies as that of Bingham (1992) who examined the epifauna growing on red mangrove roots in Florida. Differential larval recruitment was found to be more important in determining species distributions than the physical factors acting upon either larvae or adults. Butler's (1991) work on sessile invertebrates colonising Pinna shells, pier pilings and settlement panels in South Australia showed that communities were structured more by the heavy recruitment of poor competitors than by subsequent dominance of substrate space by good competitors. The enormous variability in rates of recruitment (e.g., Yoshioka, 1986) are at least partly responsible for the heterogeneity or patchiness characteristic of many hard substrate communities. Jackson (1984) found that cryptic communities on the undersides of individual corals in Jamaica developed largely independently of one another.",

                "text": "The importance of variations in larval supply ('supply-side ecology') to community composition and development is becoming increasingly evident (see Caley et al., 1996 , and references therein). Substantial variations in larval abundance occur in time ( Fig. 16 ) and at all spatial scales. Many benthic invertebrates have seasonal patterns of reproduction, releasing large numbers of larvae at particular times. Mass spawning is a well-known characteristic of reef corals, with multiple species displaying short, coordinated pulses of egg and sperm release and hence peaks in larval abundance (Richmond, 1997) . Commonly, invertebrate larvae cannot feed (i.e., they are non-planktotrophic, see Jablonski and Lutz, 1983) and are incapable of spending more than a day or so in the plankton before they are forced to settle. Therefore, recruitment of particular species onto hard substrates may take place for only a limited period of time during each year (e.g., Maturo, 1959) , with different species showing different peak times of recruitment (e.g., Brown and Swearingen, 1998) . Recruitment may also occur at different rates depending on when the substrate first becomes available for colonisation (e.g., Igic, 1972) . In many settlement panel studies, the season of panel deployment has been shown to have a large effect on which species recruit, in turn profoundly influencing subsequent community development (e.g., Sutherland and Karlson, 1977; Van Dolah et al., 1988; Nandakumar, 1996; . Superimposed on annual variations are variations between years. For instance, Haderlie (1970) found dramatic differences in the density of barnacles recruiting onto settlement panels in two successive years in Monterey Harbor, California. Such findings caution against palaeontologists attempting to explain differences in species patterns on ancient hard substrates in terms of substantial environmental changes through time.",

Carter et al. (1985) found that distance from hard bottom areas providing the source of colonisers appeared to be an important factor in community development on artificial reefs.

Note, however, that high biomasses of suspension feeders often develop in phytoplankton-rich, upwelling regions, (Witman and Dayton, 2000) and correlate with increased nutrient levels (e.g., Huang et al., 1999) . Making simple correlations between suspension feeders and nutrient levels is as unwise in the fossil record as it is at the present day unless supported by independent evidence.

In contrast, a rare study of deep-water hard substrates (Mullineaux, 1988) deployed manganese nodules at a depth of 1240 m in the Santa Catalina Basin off southern California. After 7 weeks, the nodules had been colonised by a fauna dominated by foraminiferans, with a greater settlement of larvae on surfaces in low flow regimes. Recruitment patterns may also be influenced by shading. Baird and Hughes (2000) studied the differences in recruitment on settlement panels placed beneath fronds of the tabular coral Acropora hyacinthus and those placed in the open at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. Corals, filamentous algae and coralline algae recruited less often on the plates placed beneath the corals, whereas bryozoans recruited four times more abundantly on the shaded plates. The reduction in ambient current velocity, increased sedimentation and lower light intensity associated with understory kelp environments influence recruitment patterns of sessile animals in varying ways (Duggins et al., 1990) .",

                "text": "Larval behaviour can be another major factor determining recruitment patterns. Many larvae show very specific preferences in where they settle depending on such factors as the physical and chemical condition of the substrate surface (e.g., Roberts et al., 1991) , the presence of existing colonisers (both of microscopic and macroscopic scale), colour (Pomerat and Reiner, 1942) , and especially orientation. Marine hard substrates vary in wettability (the tendency to induce spreading of a liquid on the surface), with materials such as glass being wettable and wax unwettable. Larvae often prefer non-wettable over wettable substrates (e.g., Mihm et al., 1981) . Glasby (2000) deployed settlement panels of sandstone, concrete and wood in Sydney Harbour to investigate the effects of panel composition and orientation on fouling communities. Assemblages developing on the wooden panels were always found to be significantly different from those on the lithic panels. The uniqueness of the communities on the wooden panels was partly but not entirely due to the presence of the wood-boring bivalve Bankia. Among lithic substrates, composition can influence larval settlement. For example, Bavestrello et al. (2000) found that planulae of the hydroid Eudendrium settled preferentially on carbonate rather than quartzose substrates. In contrast, Connell (2000) found that pontoon composition (sandstone or concrete) did not affect the communities developing in Sydney Harbour. Recruitment of sessile species to hard substrates may depend on the heterogeneity and structure provided by existing colonists. This was demonstrated experimentally by Bros (1987) using settlement panels in Tampa Bay, Florida: the presence of barnacle shells (living or dead) increased recruitment significantly. Wahl (1989) recognised four main stages in the establishment of fouling communities on hard substrates ( Fig. 17) . During the first stage, which can occur within a minute of the substrate being immersed, dissolved macromolecules are adsorbed onto the substrate surface, causing biochemical conditioning. Bacterial colonisation follows after about an hour, and is succeeded within about a day by unicellular eukaryotes, including diatoms, which secrete mucus as a cement. Finally, larger, multicellular organisms colonise the surface, often after about 1 week of immersion.",

Successful recruitment by corals may require the presence of crustose coralline algae (Morse et al., 1996) . Larvae of some species are gregarious (e.g., Patzkowsky, 1988; Toonen and Pawlik, 2001) , exhibiting a tendency to settle close to adult conspecifics in response to a chemical cue. In other instances, aggregation is due to different factors. For example, Keen (1987) showed that aggregated settlement of larvae of the scyphozoan Aurelia aurita was not due to gregarious behaviour but was related to substrate heterogeneity: locations where hydrodynamic shear stress was low attracted more settlers. Depressions and elevations on the surface of the substrate very often influence recruitment, with some species recruiting in greater numbers into crevices and others onto mounds. Walters and Wethey (1991) , for example, found preferential recruitment of the larvae of arborescent ascidian and bryozoan species in crevices on algal fronds. They attributed this to the protection provided against predators and dislodgement by physical disturbance during the vulnerable early phases of growth immediately after settlement. However, a co-occurring species of encrusting bryozoan settled preferentially on elevations, a behaviour possibly explained by the height advantage so gained in spatial competition. A study of the distributions of common encrusting bryozoan species on disarticulated bivalve shells off the Isle of Man showed considerable overlap between species, although some species did exhibit tendencies to occur more commonly on rough instead of smooth shell surfaces (Ward and Thorpe, 1989) .",

                "text": "Numerous studies (see references in Glasby and Connell, 2001, p. 132) have demonstrated that substrate orientation has an extremely strong effect on recruitment patterns. In an early study, Pomerat and Reiner (1942) found that two bryozoan species settled in greatest numbers on undersides of glass plates, whereas a barnacle showed no preference. Maturo (1959) also found greater settlement of bryozoans onto undersides of ceramic tiles which he attributed to the silting of upper surfaces. Coralline algae dominate upper surfaces of rocks in the intertidal and subtidal of Signy Island, Antarctica, whereas encrusting animals are almost entirely restricted to undersides . For most bryozoan species in this community, the proportion of colonies on upper rock surfaces initially increased with depth, possibly reflecting decrease in light intensity and hence the likelihood of overgrowth by coralline algae, before diminishing with greater depth as silting of upper surfaces became important in the lower current flow regimes pertaining here. Fairfull and Harriott (1999) found conspicuous differences between the organisms colonising upper and lower surfaces of settlement panels placed in 7 m of water in a subtropical setting in eastern Australia. Upper panel surfaces were dominated by algae, whereas lower surfaces were dominated by bryozoans, ascidians and sponges. Differential recruitment of spirorbid worms to shaded lower surfaces may result from the negative response of the larvae to light (Saunders and Connell, 2001 ). Horizontal and gently sloping surfaces throughout the rocky subtidal tend to be covered by macroalgae in contrast to vertical surfaces where suspension-feeding invertebrates dominate (Barnes, 1995; Witman and Dayton, 2000) . Reasons for this contrast, which may be greater in temperate than tropical environments, include differences in light levels, sedimentation rates, and degree of protection from physical and biological disturbance. With respect to the last factor, for example, grazing echinoids are known to experience difficulty attaching to steep faces, making invertebrate communities on these surfaces less susceptible to being grazed (Sebens, 1985) . Bivalve shells commonly show major differences in encrustation and boring patterns on the convex and concave surfaces (e.g., Bosence, 1979a, pl. 52, Figs. 9 and 10) . McKinney (2000) studied bryozoans encrusting disarticulated bivalves from the Adriatic and found that species with large, sheet-like colonies were commoner on convex outer surfaces whereas species with small colonies tended to settle on concave inner surfaces that provided cryptic habitats.",

Most research on hard substrate communities has been directed towards spatial competition because this is relatively easy to observe and quantify (Buss, 1990; Nandakumar and Tanaka, 1993) .

In other words, competition for food does not occur as this is a superabundant, non-limiting resource. While possibly true in some habitats, there is now good evidence that organisms on hard substrates can reduce the food resources available to their competitors (see Okamura et al., 2001 ). For example, working with experimental boxes deployed at 40 m depth on a Jamaican reef, Buss and Jackson (1981) found that high densities of sessile suspension-feeders caused a measurable depletion in planktonic food resources. There is also evidence that competition for food along the margins of neighbouring encrusting suspension feeders may retard the growth rates of competitors less able to acquire food particles, thereby making them more likely to lose in competition for substrate space (Buss, 1980; McKinney, 1992 McKinney, , 1993 . Zajac et al. (1989) presented evidence that adults and juveniles of resident species are able to deplete the food available to new colonists and hence lower recruitment rates.",

                "text": "Substrate space is very often a limiting resource for sessile organisms. Even when there is uncolonised space available on the substrate, the growth of neighbouring organisms may bring them into direct contact and force a competitive encounter. Competition for space occurs both within (intraspecific) and between (interspecific) species. There are several possible outcomes, most notably: (1) complete overgrowth by a superior spatial competitor, generally resulting in death of the inferior competitor; (2) incomplete overgrowth by a superior competitor; (3) stand-off in which no clear competitive dominant emerges but both competitors potentially have their further growth impeded; (4) reciprocal overgrowth with one competitor winning along part of the line of contact but the other winning elsewhere. Incomplete overgrowth (2) often entails the death of some but not all zooids in a colonial animal (partial mortality), with a potential reduction in reproductive fitness. Individuals of the worm Spirorbis may be incompletely overgrown by bryozoans leaving the aperture protruding through the bryozoan colony and the worm still able to feed (Stebbing, 1973a; Keen and Neill, 1980; Lopez Gappa, 1989) . between species are frequent in some hard substrate communities. For example, the majority of encounters between four species of colonial ascidians growing on settlement panels in Langston Harbour, England, resulted in stand-offs (Schmidt and Warner, 1986) . Among encrusting sponges, which cover in excess of 40% of substrate space in a New Zealand rock wall community studied by Ayling (1983) , stand-offs were the most frequent spatial interactions. Similarly, Aerts (2000) found standoffs to be more common than overgrowths in coral -sponge interactions. Instances have also been recorded of complete overgrowth resulting in a period of enforced dormancy of the overgrown organism followed by renewed activity after detachment of the overgrowing organism (Sebens, 1986; Todd and Turner, 1988) .",

They include morphological adaptations, many reflected in the skeleton and hence fossilisable, and chemical adaptations which are unlikely to leave any clear trace in the fossil record. Important morphological correlates of competitive success are growth rate, spinosity (Stebbing, 1973b) , size and thickness. Ability to lift growing edges off the substrate (Stebbing, 1973b) , to undercut (as in the bivalve Anomia) or to crush competitors, production of outgrowths (e.g., bryozoan stolons), and tentacular contact in cnidarians (Bruno and Witman, 1996) can also be important. Namikawa et al. (1992) showed that colonies of the hydroid Stylactaria living on gastropod shells developed polymorphic zooids (tentaculozooids) more frequently when in contact with the bryozoan Celleporella. Touching the tentaculozooids elicited retraction of bryozoan lophophores, possibly because of nematocyst discharge, and was hypothesised to have aided the hydroid during competition for substrate space. The inarticulate brachiopod Discinisca living in the intertidal zone of Panama uses modified lateral setae as well as movements of the shell to abrade the tissues of adjacent sponges and bryozoans competing for space (LaBarbera, 1985) .",

These effects included inhibition of bryozoan feeding, death of zooids and of entire colonies. Such allelopathic reactions may have a role in competition for substrate space. Allelopathy was also demonstrated by Bak and Borsboom (1984) who found that exudates of the Antillean reef anthozoan Condylactis significantly reduced algal biomass accumulating on experimental glass slides. A study of competition for space between two species of scleractinian corals and three of 'soft corals' (alcyonacean octocorals) on the Great Barrier Reef found that allelopathy was manifested by tissue necrolysis induced by species of each group on the other (Sammarco et al., 1985) .",

For example, Rubin (1985) found that the serpulid Pomatoceras triqueter readily overgrew colonies of the 32 bryozoan species which recruited onto settlement panels he deployed off Plymouth, England. Many of the bryozoan species, however, were able to avoid overgrowth by preferentially settling onto serpulid tubes or by growing onto them as adults. Therefore, serpulid tubes functioned as refuges for these bryozoans. Small-sized shells form refuges from intraspecific competition for hydroids living symbiotically with hermit crabs (Buss and Yund, 1988) . By virtue of their reduced surface area, small substrates are more likely to be completely covered by a species before superior competitors can settle. Grosberg (1981) found that the colonial ascidian Botryllus won the majority of competitive encounters for space with other sessile animals at Woods Hole, MA, and that larvae of subordinate competitors consequently settled preferentially away from Botryllus. Subordinate spatial competitors growing on the giant kelp in California may settle on older blades and thereby avoid competition with the dom-inant bryozoan Membranipora which mainly grows on younger blades (Bernstein and Jung, 1979) . Conversely, a potent competitor in reefal environments, the hydrozoan Millepora, actively detects and overgrows neighbouring gorgonians (Wahle, 1980) . Buss (1981b) showed how gregarious behaviour by larvae of the bryozoan Bugula turrita resulted in aggregations of colonies which were better able to compete for space with another bryozoan.",

Poorly defended lateral flanks of bryozoan colonies are vulnerable to overgrowth compared with distal growing edges where active budding takes place; some colonies may even redirect their growth in order to encounter competitors 'head-on' (Buss, 1981a) . Symbionts can also have an important effect on the performance of sessile organisms competing for space. Osman and Haugness (1981) demonstrated dramatic improvements in the success of colonies of the bryozoan Celleporaria brunnea in overgrowth interactions with other species when the C. brunnea colonies hosted the symbiotic hydroid Zanclea which could sting competing species (and predators). Another bryozoan, Rhynchozoon larreyi from the Red Sea, similarly benefits in winning substrate space by harbouring Zanclea as a symbiont (Ristedt and Schuhmacher, 1985) .",

Instead, they may take the form of a competitive network (Buss and Jackson, 1979) in which no single species is dominant: i.e., species A overgrows species B, species B overgrows species C but species C overgrows species A. For example, Sebens' (1986) study of sessile communities on subtidal vertical rock walls in Massachusetts over a 2-year period revealed a basically hierarchical competitive structure complicated by some reversals and numerous standoffs. Lopez Gappa (1989) also found an essentially hierarchical structure between encrusting bryozoans on settlement panels, as did Barnes and Lehane (2001) for South Atlantic boulder communities. In contrast, an example of a competitive network was found by Rinkevich et al. (1993) in a study of sessile invertebrates on a Red Sea reef. Four common species (a scleractinian coral, an alcyonarian coral, a hydrocoral and a sponge) formed a network in which overgrowth, allelopathy, necrosis and bleaching reactions were all involved. Russ (1982) explained competitive hierarchies in terms of backloops in essentially hierarchical systems arising from the absence of clear competitive dominance. The term 'transitivity' has been used to indicate the extent of deviation from a perfect competitive hierarchy and is quantifiable using an index of transitivity (Rubin, 1982; Tanaka and Nandakumar, 1994) . Jackson (1981) , in a review of competitive interactions between bryozoans and other organisms, underlined how subtle and complex interactions can be, and advised caution in the interpretation of even the simplest patterns.",

Poor competitors for substrate space sometimes dominate on ephemeral and disturbed hard substrates because they often exhibit higher rates of recruitment than better spatial competitors (e.g., Jackson and Winston, 1982) . Sebens (1986) found that cleared areas were colonised first by species which ranked low in the competitive hierarchy. Karande and Udhayakumar (1992) studied five species of cheilostome bryozoans colonising settlement panels suspended in Bombay Harbour over periods of 30 and 60 days. Overgrowth ability did not correlate with species abundance; in fact, the two least competitive species were the most abundant. Similarly, for bryozoans encrusting rocks in Alaska, the most abundant species were found to be low-or midranked competitors (Barnes and Dick, 2000a) , while the dominant bryozoan species in an Antarctic encrusting community wins fewer than 20% of interactions for space with other species (Barnes and Clarke, 1998) . At Signy Island in the Antarctic, tunicates and sponges are the dominant competitors but bryozoans and polychaete worms are the most abundant encrusting groups present .",

Such biofouling can be followed by successful growth of the settler across the surface of the host, sometimes completely smothering and killing the host. Therefore, organisms often exhibit strong reactions against being fouled, employing both mechanical and chemical defences. Mechanical mechanisms may also be used. These include mucus production in corals and the pincer-like structures found in echinoderm pedicellaria and some bryozoan avicularia (see Wahl, 1989) . Many marine animals produce biologically active chemicals, some potentially having an anti-fouling function. The survey conducted by Uriz et al. (1991) on Mediterranean species showed the highest levels of such activity in sponges, bryozoans and tunicates. Antifungal and antibacterial activity was regarded as particularly important in discouraging fouling. If the formation of a bacterial film is prevented, then settlement of larvae of larger organisms which preferentially settle on such films may also be prevented. In this connection, a study of antibacterial activity through secondary metabolite production and fouling in four bryozoan species from Tasmania (Walls et al., 1993) showed that the two bryozoans with the highest levels of antibacterial activity were the least fouled. Despite the existence of potent antifouling defences, biofouling is often observed, especially on exoskeletons (e.g., Rubin, 1985) , on lesions (e.g., Palumbi and Jackson, 1982) , and on older parts of colonial animals where the zooids are senescent. Fungal fouling of bryozoan colonies has been hypothesised to stimulate self-overgrowth in some species (Sterflinger and Scholz, 1997) . Wahl and Mark (1999) concluded that most macrofouling species were facultative and non-specific rather than obligate, species-specific colonisers of living substrates. Among the most conspicuous biofoulers in temperate environments is the small polychaete worm Spirorbis. This genus is also often recorded in the fossil record as a biofouler (e.g., Gibson, 1992) . Keen and Neill's (1980) study of encrusting communities on concrete blocks in the intertidal of Vancouver, Canada, found that even though blocks displayed a large amount of unoccupied primary space, Spirorbis recruited in considerably higher densities onto the surfaces of existing colonists, such as bryozoans and other serpulids, than it did on unoccupied substrate space. The biofouling ability of Spirorbis is counterbalanced by its tendency to be overgrown by spatial competitors (e.g., Gordon, 1972) .",

It has long been recognised that disturbance can act to regulate diversity by preventing a competitively dominant species from achieving a total monopoly (e.g., Paine, 1971) . Sousa (1979a,b) undertook a now classic study of the effects of disturbance on communities inhabiting boulders subject to overturning through wave action. He found that small boulders which were overturned frequently supported low diversity communities, large, infrequently overturned boulders also had low diversities, whereas boulders of intermediate size exhibited the highest diversity in accordance with the ''intermediate disturbance hypothesis''. Two types of disturbance (Connell and Keough, 1985) of different severity are recognised by marine ecologists: Type I disturbances where the damaged patch remains surrounded by survivors belonging to the original community, and Type II disturbances where the patch becomes isolated from existing communities. Whereas patches resulting from Type I disturbances can be recolonised by vegetative growth of the organisms around, Type II disturbance patches tend to become recolonised by opportunistic species, mostly through larval recruitment.",

Breitburg's (1985) research using caged and uncaged settlement panels off Santa Barbara, CA, showed how only algal crusts, diatom/cyanobacterial films and short-lived filamentous algae became abundant on substrates exposed to high levels of grazing by echinoids and asteroids. On ungrazed substrates, other algae and sessile invertebrates were also common and overall diversity was higher. Grazing not only reduced diversity by physically removing species, but it also favoured some tolerant species which inhibited the recruitment of other species. For example, grazerresistant coralline algal crusts precluded recruitment of bryozoans and polychaetes (Breitburg, 1984) . A very different effect of herbivorous grazers (limpets and chitons) was found by Van Temelen (1987) in a rocky intertidal community in California. Here removal of algae by the grazers was important in allowing recruitment of barnacles. Day's (1983) study of settlement panels on the Great Barrier Reef showed how grazing on filamentous algae by herbivorous fishes also scraped off sessile animals and allowed the faster-growing algae to monopolise space. Grazing fishes significantly altered the composition of bioeroding communities of sponges and ''worms'' without changing the total rate of bioerosion on dead corals from the Great Barrier Reef (Sammarco et al., 1987) . Kiene and Hutchings' (1994) bioerosional experiments led them to hypothesise that grazing modifies the ecological succession of endoliths by constantly exposing bare substrate that can be colonised by early successional boring species, thereby preventing the development of a 'mature' community of borers.",

Much interest has been focused on the extent to which succession is predictable, and whether it ever converges on a single, stable 'climax community' as in the classic models developed for terrestrial vegetation (see Greene and Schoener, 1982; Turner and Todd, 1993) . Sutherland and Karlson (1977) deployed ceramic settlement panels off Beaufort in North Carolina and found that panel undersides converged towards an equilibrium diversity of 10 species after 21/2 to 31/2 years. However, the pattern of succession varied greatly according to when the panels were first submerged, both on monthly (i.e., seasonally) and yearly (i.e., interannually) scales. Larval recruitment patterns were variable, and established colonists tended to inhibit (e.g., McGuinness, 1988) rather than pave the way for later colonists. Most colonists lived for less than a year and were usually replaced by different species. Sutherland and Karlson contrasted this pattern of succession with the classical succession seen in terrestrial plant communities, attributing the differences to: (1) the short-lived adults; (2) the fact that the colonists do not prepare the substrate for later arrivals; and (3) the lack of stored seeds of successional species. Longer-term findings from the Beaufort study prompted Sutherland (1981) to develop the concept of multiple stable points: resident communities which succeed in resisting recruitment over the short term may be ephemeral over the longer term because of the continued recruitment of other species, overgrowth, sloughing off and senility.",

Hirata (1987) studied the colonisation over 3 years of settlement panels placed at depths of 1, 2.5, 4 and 5.5 m in Nabeta Bay, Japan. Three successional stages could be recognised: Stage 1 was characterised by the barnacle Balanus and spirorbid worm Dexiospira, Stage 2 by the ascidian Diplosoma, and Stage 3 by the oyster Crassostrea. Panels at the deepest station failed to reach stage 3 during the 3-year period of study. Diversity rose steeply for 2 to 6 months after panel immersion to about 10 species and then leveled out in panels from the two shallower depths whereas it declined somewhat in the two deeper stations. Pisano and Boyer (1985) found that colonisation by bryozoans of settlement panels placed at 15 m in the Ligurian Sea followed a similar pattern but was slower than panels deployed at 3 m depth. In contrast, colonisation rates were found to be lower in shallow (5 -8 m) than in deeper (25 m) water sites off Signy Island in the Antarctic (Stanwell-Smith and Barnes, 1997; Fig. 22 ). Relative to temperate and tropical environments (Fig.  23) , low recruitment and slow growth in the coldwaters of the Antarctic meant that after 15 months an Fig. 22 .

Trends in the relative coverage through time of solitary and colonial species on settlement panels deployed at 1 -1.3 m below sea level at Bremerton, WA, USA. After Greene and Schoener (1982) . average of less than 2% of the surface of panels submerged at 5 m were covered, and less than 6% of those submerged at 25 m. Depth also played a significant role in succession on 8 year old lava grounds at Jan Mayen where Gulliksen et al. (1980) found that communities at depths of less than 15 m resembled those of old lava grounds more than did communities from deeper sites. This they attributed to the more severe physical conditions limiting community complexity in shallow waters.",

These early cryptic biotas included cyanobacteria, archaeocyaths, sponges, possible sponge borings, and various problematica, many of which are found only in cryptic spaces. Cambrian cavities tend to be smaller than those found in later systems, and they were quickly filled with sediment and early cements. Nevertheless, the diverse cryptic inhabitants showed possible competition for space (through overgrowths) and significant taxonomic and structural differences from their counterparts on exposed surfaces. Among the archaeocyaths, for example, exposed surfaces have solitary ajacicyathids and numerous irregular, branching forms, whereas the crypts have solitary irregulars and solitary chambered forms (Zhuravlev and Wood, 1995) . Presumably, these early cryptic organisms were exploiting the same advantages of cavity-dwelling as modern cryptobionts: refuge from most predators and reduced environmental stresses in general.",

Microborings in Middle Cambrian trilobite cuticle, apparently formed by boring algae and cyanobacteria, are illustrated and briefly discussed by Geyer and Malinky (1997) . Runnegar (1985) described microscopic, long, unbranched tunnels and short vertical holes in Cambrian mollusc shells which appear to have been excavated by photosynthetic endolithic algae. The cylindrical macroboring Trypanites is known from numerous Lower Cambrian hardgrounds, but is strangely rare in Middle and Late Cambrian and Early Ordovician hard substrates (James et al., 1977; Palmer, 1982) . Chow and James (1992, p. 120) briefly described and illustrated ''Trypaniteslike borings'' which truncate cement crystals in an Upper Cambrian hardground in Newfoundland, but the full shape and size of these excavations is unknown. Kobluk (1981b) described microscopic scalloped-shaped excavations and associated carbo-nate chips in archaeocyathan cavity walls in the Lower Cambrian of southern Labrador.

These cavities are considerably larger than their Cambrian counterparts, and in many cases they appear to have remained open for long periods. Encrusters include numerous bryozoans, stalked echinoderms and calcareous algae. Many cavities also housed worm-like endolithic organisms which produced the boring Trypanites (Fig. 3E) .

The encrusting taxa on these organic hard substrates are virtually the same as those on hardgrounds, cobbles and rocky shores. The most commonly encrusted shells are those of brachiopods (Morris and Rollins, 1971; Richards, 1972 Richards, , 1974a Alexander and Scharpf, 1990; Lescinsky, 1995; Lescinsky, 1996a) and trilobites (Clarkson and Tripp, 1982; K\u00e1cha and Saric, 1995; Brandt, 1996; Budil and Saric, 1995; Taylor and Rozhnov, 1996) . Because most mollusc shells were aragonitic in the Ordovician, encrusters are often found on their early cemented internal and external moulds (Waddington, 1980; Gabbott, 1999) , but some are found on calcitic bivalves (Morris and Felton, 1993) . The skeletons of rugose corals are also often encrusted (Elias and Buttler, 1986; Harland and Pickerill, 1987) . Articulate brachiopods have been found attached to trepostome bryozoans (Richards, 1972; Harper and Pickerill, 1996) and conulariids (Harland and Pickerill, 1987) , and inarticulate brachiopods are found on algae and graptolites (Botting and Thomas, 1999) . Soft-bodied encrusters of the Ordovician have been preserved through epibiont bioimmuration (see Section 8.5) on mollusc shells. Ordovician epibiont bioimmurations include what appear to be hydroid cnidarians . Also in the Ordovician of upper midwestern North America are cavities in trepostome bryozoan skeletons formed when the bryozoan grew up and around an encrusting, soft-bodied, stoloniferous animal, forming the trace fossil Catellocaula through bioclaustration ; Fig. 3C ).",

The first bivalve borings (Petroxestes, formed by mytilids) are also known from the Ordovician, but they are thus far only locally common in the upper midwest of North America (Pojeta and Palmer, 1976; Wilson and Palmer, 1988; Fig. 3A ). An unusual macroboring, representing the first occurrence of the ichnogenus Gastrochaenolites, has been recently described by Ekdale and Bromley (2001) (see also Ekdale et al., 2002) from Ordovician (Volkhovian) hardgrounds in Sweden. This vase-shaped trace (G. oelandicus) is thus far found in only one formation. The tracemaker is unknown, but it almost certainly was not a bivalve.",

Lescinsky and Benninger (1994) pointed out how pressure solution can produce structures resembling predator traces, and the ubiquitous Trypanites borings sometimes cut through shells in cemented sediments, forming holes easily mistaken for predator drillings (see Bucher, 1938; Kaplan and Baumiller, 2000 , with alternative interpretations given respectively by Richards and Shabica, 1969; Wilson and Palmer, 2001 ; the borings in Cameron, 1967 , are also not likely to have been those of predators). Carriker and Yochelson (1968) attribute a particular type of round hole in Ordovician brachiopod shells to a softbodied epibiont, not a predator.",

Acrothoracican barnacles borings make their appearance in the shells of platyceratid gastropods (Baird et al., 1990 ) and brachiopods (Rodriguez and Gutschick, 1977) ; they are also known in oncoids (Rodriguez and Gutschick, 2000) . Ctenostome bryozoan borings are described in brachiopod shells by Richards (1974b) , Pohowsky (1978) and Vogel et al. (1987) . ''Sponge'' borings in shells and carbonate rocks are reported in older literature (Fenton and Fenton, 1932; Solle, 1938) and in Vogel et al. (1987) , but their origins are still unclear. Microborings in the Devonian are still mostly attributed to algae and/or fungi (Kobluk and Risk, 1974; Vogel, 1987; Vogel et al., 1987) . What are almost certainly predatory borings, attributed to gastropods, have been reported in Middle Devonian brachiopod shells (Rodriguez and Gutschick, 1970; Smith et al., 1985; Leighton, 2001 ) and blastoids (Baumiller, 1993) .

Spiriferid brachiopod substrates in North America are often encrusted by trepostome, fenestellid and ctenostome bryozoans, hederellids, cornulitids, edrioasteroids, foraminiferans, and brachiopods (Nelson and Bolton, 1980; Powers and Ausich, 1990; Lescinsky, 1997) . Legrand-Blain and Poncet (1991) describe a similar assemblage of encrusters on brachiopods from Algeria, with the addition of calcareous algae and tabulate corals. Demosponges served as hard substrates for bryozoans, ''worm'' tubes, rugose corals and articulate brachiopods (Gundrum, 1979) . Demosponges were themselves significant epibionts in some muddy substrates where shells provided the only hard substrate (Molineux, 1994) . Attached vermiform gastropods, which appear to be convergent with vermetids, make their first appearance on Lower Carboniferous stromatolites in Great Britain (Burchette and Riding, 1977) . Note, however, that Weedon (1990) considered these fossils not to be gastropods. Cemented bivalves appear first in the Lower Carboniferous (Nicol, 1978) . Episkeletobionts are also known on crinoid stems (Powers and Ausich, 1990; Donovan and Lewis, 1999; Wyse Jackson et al., 1999) , rugose corals (Con-dra and Elias, 1944; Sando, 1984; Nakazawa, 2001) , bivalves (Trueman, 1942; Kammer et al., 1987) , bellerophontids (Taylor, 1985) , brachiopod spines (Billing, 1991) , fenestrate bryozoans (Condra and Elias, 1944) and cephalopods (Seilacher, 1963) . A ''loosely attached'' and apparently mobile foraminiferan is known from biogenic substrates in England (Cossey and Mundy, 1990) and North America (Toomey, 1972) .",

Predatory borings and other signs of predation in brachiopod shells, probably produced by gastropods, are now well known (Ausich and Gurrola, 1979; Alexander, 1981; Baumiller et al., 1999) , as are ''non-predatory'' holes made by platyceratid gastropods in crinoids (Baumiller, 1990) . Acrothoracican barnacle borings are common in brachiopod shells (Ettensohn, 1978; Lescinsky, 1997) and limestone cobbles (Webb, 1993 (Webb, , 1994 . The earliest known Gastrochaenolites, apparently constructed by mytilid bivalves, is found in the Upper Carboniferous rockgrounds in Arkansas (Webb, 1994; Wilson and Palmer, 1998; Fig. 3D) , and Caulostrepsis is present in Upper Carboniferous rockgrounds of Utah (Loope, 1994) and Kansas (West and Palmer, 1983) . Microborings are thus far not common in the Carboniferous; the ichnogenera Eurygonum and Scolecia, probably produced by cyanobacteria, are possibly known from the Lower Carboniferous of Utah (Vogel, 1991; Glaub et al., 1999) .",

                "text": "Carbonate hardgrounds provided extensive marine hard substrates in the Jurassic, and thus show the highest diversity of encrusters and borers. Cementing oysters and oyster-like bivalves, such as Eopecten, and Plicatula, become very common on all marine hard substrates (see, for example, Merkt, 1966; Kauffman, 1978 Kauffman, , 1981 Harper and Palmer, 1993; Villamil et al., 1998; Wilson et al., 1998a,b) . Oysters and oyster-like bivalves are particularly common on many Jurassic hardgrounds (Fig. 1A) , often producing thick crusts (Palmer and F\u00fcrsich, 1974; Andersson, 1979; F\u00fcrsich, 1979; Gruszczynski, 1979 Gruszczynski, , 1986 F\u00fcrsich and Oschmann, 1986; Kershaw and Smith, 1986; Valenzuela et al., 1992; Garcia, 1993; Harper and Palmer, 1993; . Encrusted and bored rockgrounds are also fairly common in the Jurassic. Some of the best known are the Carboniferous limestone substrates that formed rocky shorelines during the Jurassic in southern Wales and England. The eroded upper surfaces are encrusted by corals and oysters, and contain the borings Gastrochaenolites and Trypanites (Johnson and McKerrow, 1995; Cole and Palmer, 1999) . Similarly encrusted and bored Jurassic karst surfaces in limestones are known in northwestern Germany (Helm, 1998) and Scotland (Farris et al., 1999) . Encrusted and bored carbonate pebbles and cobbles, including exhumed concretions, are also described from the Jurassic (Voigt, 1968a; Hallam, 1969; Kazmierczak, 1974; Baird and F\u00fcrsich, 1975; Andersson, 1979; F\u00fcrsich, 1979; Kelly, 1980; Chudzikiewicz and Wieczorek, 1985; Palmer and Wilson, 1990; F\u00fcrsich et al., 1992; Hesselbo and Palmer, 1992) .",

Carbonate hardgrounds are primarily bored by bivalves ; see also Neto de Carvalho and Farinha, 2001) . Numerous predatory borings in Jurassic shells have also been described (see Harper and Wharton, 2000; Kowalewski et al., 1998) . Limestone rockgrounds are bored by bivalves and ''worms'' in Britain (Johnson and McKerrow, 1995; Cole and Palmer, 1999) and Poland (Radwanski, 1959) . The first wood-boring bivalves appear in the Jurassic (Kelly, 1988; Evans, 1999; Schlirf, 2000) . Microborings in Jurassic shells and coral skeletons are well described (Gatrall and Golubic, 1970; Gehring, 1986; Glaub, 1988 Glaub, , 1994 Glaub and Schmidt, 1994; Glaub and Bundschuh, 1997; Hary, 1987; Kolodziej, 1997; Vogel et al., 1999) .

Igneous and silicic metamorphic rock substrates, which were exposed in high-energy, shallow marine settings (Fig. 26) , are described as heavily encrusted by serpulids, oysters, rudistids, spondylids, cyclostome and cheilostome bryozoans, scleractinian corals, foraminiferans, sponges, and thecideide and craniid brachiopods (Z\u00e1ruba, 1948; Pietzsch, 1962; Pianovskaya and Hecker, 1966; Surlyk and Christensen, 1974; Z\u00edtt and Nekvasilov\u00e1, 1989 , 1991a Nekvasilov\u00e1, 1982 Nekvasilov\u00e1, , 1986 Crampton, 1988; Hercogov\u00e1, 1988; Nekvasilov\u00e1 and Z\u00edtt, 1988; Asgaard and Bromley, 1991; Lescinsky et al., 1991; Z\u00edtt, 1992a; Johnson and Hayes, 1993; Johnson et al., 1996; Sanders, 1997; Stilwell, 1997; Z\u00edtt et al., 1997a Z\u00edtt et al., ,b, 1999 Wilson and Taylor, 2001a) . Limestone rockgrounds are encrusted as heavily as their igneous and metamorphic rock counterparts, and are in addition bored by bivalves, barnacles, worms, and clionid sponges (Gonzalez-Donoso et al., 1983; Ellis, 1983; Mikul\u00e1s, 1992; Z\u00edtt, 1992b; Voigt et al., 1994) . Phosphatic rockgrounds, hardgrounds and cobbles are similarly encrusted and bored (Kennedy and Garrison, 1975a,b; Delamette, 1989 Delamette, , 1990 Pomoni-Papaioannou and Solakius, 1991; Bryan, 1992; Pomoni-Papaioannou, 1994; Z\u00edtt and Mikul\u00e1s, Fig. 26 . Reconstruction of the Late Cretaceous rocky shoreline community at Iv\u00f6 Klack, Sweden. Boulders of Precambrian gneiss are encrusted by a variety of sclerobionts. These are zoned, with serpulids predominating on boulder undersides and spondylid bivalves on uppermost surfaces. After Surlyk and Christensen (1974) . 1994). Carbonate hardgrounds are abundant in the Cretaceous, extending from shallow-water, highenergy limestones (see Palmer, 1982; Tripathi and Lahiri, 2000) to deepwater, low-energy chalks (see Bromley, 1967 Bromley, , 1968 Bromley and Gale, 1982) . Encrusting and boring communities on these hardgrounds are virtually identical to those on rockgrounds, especially limestone rockgrounds (Voigt, 1959 (Voigt, , 1974 Lewy, 1985; Garrison et al., 1987) .",

The encrusters include cheilostome and cyclostome bryozoans, oysters and serpulids (see, for example, Pugaczewska, 1965; Carter, 1968; Cuffey et al., 1981; Bottjer, 1982; Hattin, 1986; Lehmann and Wippich, 1995) . Cryptic Cretaceous faunas, as described below, have been found on the undersurfaces of rudistid bivalves and corals (Housa and Nekvasilov\u00e1, 1987) , and semi-cryptic encrusting foraminiferans are known from bryozoan substrates (Pozaryska and Voigt, 1985) . Sponge-on-sponge encrusting has been described from Cenomanian lithistid sponge mounds (Kauffman et al., 2000) . Preservation of soft-bodied encrusters by bioimmuration is becoming increasingly better known from the Cretaceous. The bioimmured fossils include hydroids (Taylor, 1988; Jarms and Voigt, 1994) , ctenostome bryozoans (Voigt, 1968b; Todd et al., 1997) , and even seagrass (Voigt, 1981) .",

Drill holes, probably made by from predatory gastropods, into bivalve and gastropod shells are described from the Albian by Taylor et al. (1983) . Similar borings occur in Santonian echinoids (Cross and Rose, 1994) and Cretaceous brachiopods (Harper and Wharton, 2000; Fig. 27) . Some unusual features associated with bioerosion on Cretaceous shells are the traces of limpet grazing on ammonites (Akpan et al., 1982; Kase et al., 1994 Kase et al., , 1998 and foraminiferans clustered around the papillae of clionid sponges (Bromley and Nordmann, 1971; Voigt and Bromley, 1974 ). An interesting controversy has developed around perforations in the conchs of Cretaceous ammonites: are they bite marks from mosasaurs (Kauffman and Kesling, 1960; Tsujita and Westermann, 2001) or limpet homing scars (Kase et al., 1998; Seilacher, 1998) ? We believe that the case is stronger for the mosasaur bite interpretation. Microborings are well described from Cretaceous shells (Taylor, 1971; Glaub and Bundschuh, 1997; Hofman, 1996; Hofman and Vogel, 1992) and even fish teeth (Underwood et al., 1999) . Podichnus, the boring produced by brachiopod pedicles, is found on some Cretaceous shell surfaces (Bromley and Surlyk, 1973; Nekvasilov\u00e1, 1975 Nekvasilov\u00e1, , 1976 , as is the echinoid grazing trace Gnathichnus (Breton et al., 1992) . Wood-boring bivalves diversify and increase in abundance in the Cretaceous Kelly, 1988; Crampton, 1990; Savrda and King, 1993; Mikul\u00e1s, 1993; Evans, 1999) , all forming borings of the ichnogenus Teredolites.",

                "text": "The most prominent Cenozoic hard substrate communities in the literature are those of carbonate rocky shores, which are often intensely bored and occasionally encrusted. These assemblages are well studied because they provide critical information about sea level changes in the climatically volatile Tertiary and Quaternary. Clionid sponge, bivalve, polychaete worm and barnacle borings have been well described from carbonate littoral cliffs and ramps in the Eocene of Poland (Roniewicz, 1970) , the Eocene of Iraq (Hanna and Al-Radwany, 1993) , the Miocene of Poland (Radwanski, 1964 (Radwanski, , 1965 (Radwanski, , 1967 (Radwanski, , 1968a (Radwanski, ,b, 1969 (Radwanski, , 1970 (Radwanski, , 1977 Baluk and Radwanski, 1977) , the Miocene of Spain (Martin et al., 2001) , the Miocene of Bulgaria (Koyumdzhsieva, 1976) , the Miocene of the Czech Republic , the Miocene of Brazil (Fernandes and Assis, 1980) , the Miocene and Pliocene of Portugal (da Silva et al., 1999) , the Pliocene of Egypt (Aigner, 1983 , but see Hamza, 1983 , for reasons why it may be post-Pliocene), the Pliocene of southern California (Watkins, 1990a,b) , the Pliocene of Greece (Bromley and Asgaard, 1993a,b) , the Plio-Pleistocene of Italy (Bromley and D'Alessandro, 1983 , the ''post-Pliocene'' of Egypt (Hamza, 1983) , and the Pleistocene of Mexico (Libbey and Johnson, 1997) . Rocky shore borings and encrusters are also described from noncarbonate substrates, such as Miocene and Pliocene Gastrochaenolites in slates in Australia (Bolger and Russell, 1983 ; note that they termed the borings Trypanites), vermetid gastropod and bryozoan biostromes on Miocene dacites in Spain (Betzler et al., 2000) , serpulid, bryozoan and foraminiferal biostromes on metamorphic basement in the Miocene of Austria (Friebe, 1994) , pholadid bivalve borings in Pliocene siltstones of Mexico (Ledesma-Vazquez and Johnson, 1994) , and various Late Pleistocene encrusters and borers on andesites in Mexico (Johnson and Ledesma-V\u00e1zquez, 2001 ). For a review of Upper Pleistocene rocky shores, see Johnson and Libbey (1997) ; for a review of rocky shores in the Phanerozoic, see Johnson and Baarli (1999) . Associated with rocky shores are cobble and boulder beds, which were often bored and encrusted in the Cenozoic (e.g., Dom\u00e8nach et al., 2001 ). Pebbles and cobbles of limestones and calcareous sandstones are found heavily bored by bivalves and polychaetes in the Eocene of Croatia (Babic and Zupanic, 2000) . A late Eocene basaltic pebble and cobble rockground in New Zealand was described by Lee et al. (1997) . These clasts are encrusted by an extraordinary diversity of skeletal organisms, including coralline algae, serpulids, bivalves, foraminiferans, brachiopods, and over 70 species of cheilostome and cyclostome bryozoans. Carbonate cobbles and boulders are heavily bored by clionid sponges and bivalves in the Miocene of Spain (Doyle et al., 1998) . Cuffey and Johnson (1997) found andesite pebbles and cobbles thickly encrusted with a cheilostome bryozoan in the Pliocene of Mexico, and Kidwell and Gyllenhaal (1998) described similar cheilostome encrustation of Pliocene gastropod shells and crystalline rock clasts. Aguirre and Jim\u00e9nez (1997) assessed hard-substrate encrusters and borers from diverse boulders in the Plio-Pleistocene of Spain. Johnson and Ledesma-V\u00e1zquez (1999) described a fauna of encrusting oysters, corals and coralline red algae on andesite and granite boulders in the Pleistocene of Mexico.",

Notable studies describe borings in Eocene mollusc shells (Abletz, 1993 (Abletz, , 1994 , Oligocene -Miocene corals and molluscs from the West Indies (Pleydell and Jones, 1988) , molluscs in the Polish Miocene (Baluk and Radwanski, 1977) and Argentine Miocene (Farinati and Zavala, 2002) , Miocene capulid gastropod scars on pectinids in France (Bongrain, 1995) , Pliocene polydorid borings in bivalves in Japan (Watanabe and Noda, 1995) , gastropod ''homing scars'' on other gastropods (Noda, 1991) , lithophagid bivalve borings in Eocene and Oligocene corals of Florida and the Caribbean (Krumm and Jones, 1993; Krumm, 1999) , ctenostome bryozoan borings in Pliocene bivalve shells in Spain (Mayoral, 1988a,b) , echinoid grazing traces on shells and limestone pebbles in the Pliocene of Spain (Martinell, 1982) ; plus a variety of borings in Pliocene corals (Bromley and D'Alessandro, 1990) and brachiopods (Taddei Ruggiero, 1999) , lithophagid bivalve borings in Pleistocene corals in the British West Indies (Jones and Pemberton, 1988) , sponge, bivalve and polychaete borings in Pleistocene corals on Jamaica (Perry, 2000) , sponge, bryozoan, polychaete and gastropod borings in Pleistocene mollusc shells (Miller and Alvis, 1986) , and diverse borings in Pleistocene brachiopods (Taddei Ruggiero and Annunziata, 2002) and early Holocene bivalve shells (Martinell and Dom\u00e8nech, 1981) . The monograph by Radtke (1991) is a thorough analysis of Palaeogene microborings in a variety of hard substrates. Wood-boring bivalves reached their full diversity by the Cenozoic (Hoagland and Turner, 1981; Evans, 1999) . Numerous studies of Cenozoic wood-boring bivalves and their traces include Palaeocene teredinids in Iraq (Elliot, 1963) and North America (Cvancara, 1970; Savrda, 1991; , Eocene Teredolites in England (Hugget and Gale, 1995) , and Miocene wood-boring bivalves in Korea (Noda and Lee, 1989) . Predatory borings and examples of durophagy are commonplace in Cenozoic molluscan shells. Drilling behaviour entered what Kowalewski et al. (1998) call the ''Cenozoic Phase'' in the Late Cretaceous. Gastropods are the primary drillers, and they have a significant effect on the morphology and distribution of their prey. Examples of published studies include gastropod predation on Eocene echinoids (Gibson and Watson, 1989) , stomatopod predation on gastropods in the Miocene (Baluk and Radwanski, 1996) , drilling predation on Miocene molluscs (Kelley, 1988; Hoffmeister and Kowalewski, 2001; Verde, 2001 ), durophagous and drilling predation among Pliocene molluscs (Boekschoten, 1967) , and naticid gastropod drilling of bivalves, gastropods, and barnacles in the Pleistocene (Miller and Alvis, 1986) .",

It is a relatively simple matter to map sclerobiont distributions, especially on flat, two-dimensional surfaces (e.g., Surlyk and Christensen, 1974, Figs. 3 and 4; F\u00fcrsich, 1979, Fig. 17; Nebelsick et al., 1997, Fig.  2A ), or to record frequencies of skeletobionts within defined sectors of regularly shaped biotic substrates, such as brachiopod shells (e.g., Sparks et al., 1980; Alvarez and Taylor, 1987; Alexander and Scharpf, 1990) . Statistical tests can then be applied to determine whether the distribution is random or nonrandom (i.e., spaced or clumped), and to quantify the proportion of the surface occupied by particular taxa of sclerobionts. Variations in the distributions of sclerobionts on different surfaces of a single substratum can also be evaluated; for example, quantitative or qualitative differences in colonisation of upper and lower surfaces can be investigated.",

Palmer and Palmer (1977) mapped the surface of an Ordovician hardground in Iowa and found strongly clumped distributions in several of the taxa colonising the upper hardground surface. In the case of Trypanites, individual borings were found to be clustered on low hummocks and present in much lower densities on the surrounding flat regions (see also Brett and Brookfield, 1984) . The oyster Nanogyra was found to have a clustered distribution on a Jurassic hardground mapped by Kershaw and Smith (1986) . Clustering has also been reported by F\u00fcrsich (1979) on European Jurassic hardgrounds. Gibson (1992) found that the Devonian worm Spirorbis laxus showed a strong preference for low areas between grooves on brachiopod shells. Mapping of skeletobionts on Upper Cretaceous bivalve shells from Delaware revealed non-random patterns of distribution, notably with the borings Entobia and Gastrochaenolites concentrated on parts of shells of high relief where sediment cover was likely to be minimal (Bien et al., 1999 ). Bishop's exemplary study of encrusting bryozoans on the concave inner surfaces of disarticulated Pliocene bivalves showed that Cribrilina puncturata recruited preferentially to what would have been the highest point of the shell interior when the shell was resting in a stable, convex-up position on the sandy sea floor (Fig. 28) . This pattern could be explained by the geonegative bryozoan larvae creeping up the inside of the shell until they reached the highest position before becoming fixed and undergoing metamorphosis. In this location, clogging of the tentacle crowns and mechanical damage by entrained particles of sediment would be mini-mised. Sando's (1984) analysis of epibiont distribution on horn-shaped rugose corals demonstrated the preference of most species for concave sides and distal parts of their hosts. This pattern was taken to support the notion that such horn corals lived prostrate on the seabed with the concave surface uppermost. Bryozoans were recorded by Brandt (1996) as preferentially encrusting the sagittal axis of the semiinfaunal Ordovician trilobite Flexicalymene. This is the highest part of the dorsal exoskeleton and was probably held above sediment surface during life.",

Plates of the large demosponge P. magna hosted on their undersides a diverse encrusting fauna of smaller sponges, serpulids, cemented bivalves, thecidean brachiopods and bryozoans. In contrast, sponge upper surfaces were almost entirely encrusted by one bivalve, Atreta retifera. The main factor inferred by Palmer and F\u00fcrsich (1981) to have caused such strong polarisation was the difference in sedimentation, mostly in the form of faecal pellets, with encrusters on lower surfaces being those unable to cope with sediment. Other Jurassic sponges show a similar Fig. 28 .

After Bishop (1988) . polarisation of encrusting skeletobionts, with the distributions of thecideans and bryozoans strongly biased towards undersurfaces (e.g., Pajaud, 1974, Table 1 ). Martindale (1992) described Recent and Pleistocene reefs in Barbados where exposed surfaces have thick crusts of coralline algae whereas cryptic surfaces are covered by thin algal crusts, bryozoans, foraminiferans and serpulid worms. The lower, oral surface of both Miocene and Recent dead echinoid tests is more densely encrusted than the upper, aboral surface (Nebelsick et al., 1997) .",

                "text": "Hardground faunas also commonly show polarisation. In Jurassic hardgrounds, the upper surface is generally dominated by cemented bivalves, erect bryozoans, the crinoid Apiocrinus and the foraminiferan Nubeculinella, whereas underhangs are colonised by serpulids, calcareous sponges, thecidean brachiopods and encrusting bryozoans (F\u00fcrsich, 1979) . Palmer and F\u00fcrsich (1974) have described a particularly good example of polarisation on a hardground from the Bathonian of Bradford-on-Avon, England. The number of species recorded from the upper surface and cavity roofs of this hardground is exactly the same but their identities are mostly different. The biomass on the upper surface is much greater because many of the species here are large arborescent animals which fed at higher tiers ('silvide layers') than the exclusively lowlevel ('crustose layers') suspension feeders on the cavity roofs. Another British Middle Jurassic hardground containing precementational burrows was found to show differences between colonisation of Fig. 29 . Reconstruction of an early Cretaceous cobble dwelling community from Faringdon, England. Robust encrusters, including the oyster Exogyra and bryozoan Reptoclausa, encrust exposed outer surfaces, whereas the cryptic habitats provided by borings (Gastrochaenolites and Trypanites) support more delicate encrusters, such as foraminiferans and the runner-like bryozoan Stomatopora. After Wilson (1986a) . Fig. 30 . Genesis of ostreoliths (free-lying oyster balls) from the Middle Jurassic Carmel Formation of Utah, USA. Frequent rolling ensured no faunal polarisation. After Wilson et al. (1998a,b) . the upper hardground surface, burrow floors and burrow roofs (Kershaw and Smith, 1986) . Oysters and borings covered the upper hardground surface, burrow roofs were occasionally densely encrusted by serpulids, but floors were devoid of encrusters. Examples of polarisation may also be seen in pebble-and cobble-encrusting biotas (e.g., Bryan, 1992) . Striking differences in the biotas colonising exposed outer surfaces of cobbles and cryptic interiors of vacant borings were recorded by Wilson (1986a) in a study of hard substrates in a high energy Cretaceous environment (Fig. 29) . The lack of polarisation in other such biotas has been inferred to indicate rolling of the clasts (e.g., Lee et al., 1997) . Extreme cases of distributional homogeneity are represented by rolling hard substrates that became totally encapsulated by a single species of encrusting sclerobiont. Examples include rhodoliths formed by coralline algae (e.g., Bosence, 1983) , coralliths by corals (e.g., Glynn, 1974; Dullo and Hecht, 1990) , ectoproctoliths (or bryoliths) by bryozoans (e.g., Nebelsick, 1996) , and ostreoliths by oysters (e.g., Wilson et al., 1998a,b; Fig. 30) .",

                "text": "Concavo-convex Palaeozoic brachiopods often show different degrees of encrustation of the two valves. In a Devonian assemblage, Bordeaux and Brett (1990) found that convex valves, which they supposed to have rested on the seabed when the host was alive, were more heavily encrusted than the concave valves, possibly reflecting reorientation after death of the brachiopod. An extensive analysis by Lescinsky (1995) of epibiont distributions on concavo-convex brachiopods (excluding productids) from the Ordovician and Devonian showed that epibionts were more common on convex than concave valves. Many of the brachiopods could be shown to have been alive when encrusted, leading Lescinsky to suggest that living brachiopods rested on the seabed with the convex valve uppermost, the opposite of conventional wisdom (but see Leighton, 1998 ; note also that encrusters commonly grow towards the brachiopod commissure, supporting a concaveupwards life orientation as growth downwards towards the sediment seems less likely). Biconvex brachiopods may also show differential encrustation patterns apparently reflecting the life orientation of the host, as in the case of the Devonian species P. bownockeri where encrusters are commoner on brachial valves that are thought to have been oriented upwards after pedicle atrophy (Kesling et al., 1980) . The distribution of Podichnus, a trace fossil made by brachiopod pedicles, on the surfaces of individuals of the Carboniferous brachiopod Leiorhynchoidea was studied by Alexander (1994) . Most Podichnus were located close to the anterolateral incurrent regions of their hosts and none were observed on the shell posterior. The beaks of the living host shells were interpreted to have been buried in sediment and fouled by larvae that behaved rheotaxically. A comparison can be made with trigoniid bivalves, some of which are semi-infaunal leaving only the posteriorposteroventral region of the shell exposed for colonisation (Villamil et al., 1998) . Watson (1982) Fig. 31 . Polarisation of skeletobionts encrusting and boring the exposed upper surface and cryptic underside of a hypothetical stromatoporoid, shown in vertical section, from the Silurian of Gotland, Sweden. After Kershaw (1980) . described clustering of attached individuals of the inarticulate brachiopod Discinisca around the posterior margins of the bivalve Dacryomya from the Jurassic. The brachiopods are interpreted to have exploited the feeding currents of their semi-infaunal hosts by attaching in this location above the sediment -water interface. Wignall and Simms (1990) have described an example of polarisation of xylobionts attached to a plank of Jurassic driftwood. There is a marked contrast between the upper surface of the wood, colonised by small numbers of oysters and serpulids, and the lower surface where serpulids in particular are much more abundant (Fig. 32 ). Both floating wood and drifting ammonite shells sometimes preserve sclerobionts (bivalves, brachiopods, crinoids and lepadomorph barnacles) which hung pendently from their undersides (Wignall and Simms, 1990) .",

In both cases, the dorsoventral axis pointed downslope (Fig. 33) , thereby decreasing the likelihood of sediment entering the valves. F\u00fcrsich (1979) reported a similar downslope orientation for Atreta on inclined hardground surfaces (e.g., pseudoanticlines formed by warping during cementation), whereas flat hardgrounds usually failed to show any evidence of a preferred orientation in this bivalve. Another cemented bivalve, Spondylus, shows a clear pattern of orientation on Cretaceous rockgrounds and boulders in Bohemia Nekvasilov\u00e1, 1994, 1996) , with umbones positioned in the upper left quadrants of the encrusted substrates. Boulders in Sweden colonised by Late Cretaceous encrusters include inarticulate brachiopods showing strong downslope orientation (Surlyk and Christensen, 1974) . Jurassic thecidean brachiopods cemented to conical corals are oriented with their commissures directed towards the base of the corals (Housa and Nekvasilov\u00e1, 1987; Fig. 34) . Downslope orientation has also been noted in the bivalve Placunopsis matercula cemented to the large bivalve Plagiostoma [Lima] lineata in the German Triassic (Seilacher, 1954) , and in the inarticulate brachiopod Orbiculoidea papyracea pedically attached to ammonites from the German Lower Jurassic (Seilacher, 1982) . Perhaps the oldest occurrence of downslope orientation, termed 'slopelet line docking' by Struve (1980) , occurs in the Silurian brachiopod Liljevallia gotlandica encrusting the undersides of stromatoporoids (Nield 1986a) .",

The usual explanation for this pattern is that the cornulitids benefited from the feeding or respiratory currents of the living host. Duringer (1985) documented radially oriented growth in densely spaced populations of the Triassic encrusting bivalve Placunopsis ostracina. Four-leafed clover patterns (Fig. 36) , in which the umbones of four individuals are touching, were found to be common. It was inferred that such radial patterns developed when the density of larval recruits was high because the bivalves reoriented themselves to maximise perimeter/area ratio. In contrast, low recruitment densities caused bivalves to become oriented with respect to ambient current flow, thereby resulting in parallel alignment.",

There are distinct advantages, however, in studying competition on hard substrate communities. One of the primary limiting resources for these communities was often living space, and sessile skeletal encrusters, and to some extent borers, can show competitive interactions through overgrowths, raised margins, changed growth directions, and other features preserved in fossils (Figs. 37 and 38 ). Encrusting and boring communities have an easily discernible stratigraphy (see Section 3) where we can at least establish a sequence of biotic and physical events.

                "text": "The most common spatial relationship between potentially competing encrusters on hard substrates is the growth of one over the other. The dilemma is trying to deduce whether the two organisms were alive at the time one overgrew the other (live -live interaction), and thus potentially competitive. McKinney (1995a,b) and Fagerstrom et al. (2000) have each provided useful discussions of the ways in which live -live interactions can be discerned in fossil material. The most conclusive evidence consists of: (1) changes in the skeletons (such as raised margins, spine development, or altered growth direction) at the margins where the organisms interacted, followed with lesser confidence by (2) skeletal modifications in only one of the organisms, and (3) lack of erosion or sediment between the top of the overgrown and base of the overgrower. Reciprocal overgrowth (e.g., Lescinsky, 1993, Figs. 2F and 38A) is another sure indication that both organisms were alive but such 'draws' provide no information on competitive dominance unless the areas overgrown by each competitor are compared. Extant hard substrate encrusters are known to compete for space without leaving clear evidence for it in their skeletons (Fagerstrom et al., 2000) , dead encrusters can have pristine skeletons when encrusted by later organisms, and overgrowing encrusters can develop skeletal modifications to the physical characteristics of the substrate they are covering that do not indicate a live -live interaction. Unequivocal competitive interactions among encrusters are seldom demonstrable in the fossil record; see the arguments in McKinney (1995a,b) and the study of recent epibionts on live and dead scallop shells by Lescinsky (1993) . Fagerstrom et al. (2000, p. 20) reached a similar conclusion: ''Prudence suggests that without skeletal distortion in one or both competitors, livedead association is more probable than competition.'' This may be true for encrusters on long-lived substrates but it is less likely for more ephemeral substrates where colonising organisms have roughly equivalent lifespans to the age of the substrate. Statistically significant overgrowth patterns where some taxa are consistently more overgrown than others may be used in a probabilistic way to determine competitive dominance (McKinney, 1995b) even if specific interactions cannot be categorised with certainty as either live -live or live -dead. This is because overgrowth of dead organisms adds noise to the data that can diminish the degree of dominance of one taxon over another but does not reverse the direction of competitive dominance.",

Taylor (1984b) demonstrated again with Silurian encrusting bryozoans a variety of growing-edge effects as the results of competition. Thirdly, Lescinsky (1993) , in a study of Carboniferous epibionts on brachiopods, showed a few competitive interactions among encrusting bryozoans and worms. Several other studies have recorded skeletal overgrowths between species (Palmer and Palmer, 1977; Taylor, 1979b; Alvarez and Taylor, 1987; Hollingworth and Wignall, 1992) or stand-offs (Alexander and Scharpf, 1990; Kidwell and Gyllenhaal, 1998) . Network diagrams can be used to express the realationships found (Fig.  39) . Wilson (1998) studied overgrowths among species encrusting Jurassic hardground cavities and found an inverse correlation between overgrowth index and the coverage of substrate space, a relationship also seen in some modern communities (see Section 6.2).",

Autogenic successions are controlled by recruitment, competition, predation, etc. A physically controlled (allogenic) succession is one in which the community changes in response to a changing environment. The succession of an intertidal community into a subtidal one with a gradually increasing sea level would be an example of allogenic succession.

For example, hardground communities can develop through several stages in response to early diagenetic cementation of the substrate (Goldring and Kazmierczak, 1974; Gruszczynski, 1979 Gruszczynski, , 1986 Walker and Diehl, 1986; Goldring, 1995) , cave faunas can change over time with increasing sedimentation and restriction of the environment (Wilson, 1998) , and reefs and bioherms respond to changes in sea levels and climate (Toomey and Cys, 1979; Crame, 1980; Williams, 1980; Nakazawa, 2001) . Physical changes primarily control these successions, but biotic interactions such as larval recruitment strategies and competition are still critical. The complex nature of the physical and biological factors, though, makes it nearly impossible to distinguish one set from another. The interaction of colonisation and physical abrasion on bored clasts has been modelled by Babic and Zupanic (2000) .",

The most basic type of bioimmuration-an epibiont mould bioimmuration-consists of an imprint of an overgrown epibiont on the underside of the organism that lived on the same substratum and overgrew it (Fig. 42) , for example, a hydroid impression on the attachment scar of an oyster. Epibiont cast bioimmurations may be produced if the epibiont mould between the overgrowing organism and its substrate is infilled with diagenetic minerals. Fouling organisms with hard skeletons may carry a mouldic impression of the substrate on their attached surfaces, known as a substratum bioimmuration. A final type of bioimmuration is a bioclaustration or pseudoboring, formed when a soft-bodied fouling organism becomes embedded in the skeleton of its host. In contrast with other bioimmurations, bioclaus-trations have sometimes been given ichnotaxonomic names. For example, Radwanski and Baluk (1997) erected the ichnotaxon Clavatulicola evaephilus for bioclaustrational furrows in the Miocene gastropod Clavatula which were formed in response to the presence of a soft-bodied symbiont. Parabolic embedment pits-Tremichnus (Brett, 1985; Feldman and Brett, 1998) -in crinoids are also bioclaustrations. Chatterton (1975) described, as Burrinjuckia spiriferidophilia, open-ended tubes formed within the brachial valves of some Devonian brachiopods apparently in response to the presence of a suspension feeding symbiont. These too can be classified as bioclaustrations.",

Sclerobionts that colonised diagenetically unstable substrates, notably aragonitic mollusc shells, or substrates prone to decay (e.g., wood; Evans and Todd, 1997) , otherwise lost to the fossil record, can also be preserved if bioimmured. However, most interest in bioimmuration has focused on soft-bodied epibionts. Examples of bioimmured ctenostome bryozoans, hydroids and pterobranch hemichordates (Rhabdopleura) are common in the Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks of northwest Europe particularly (see Taylor, 1990; Todd et al., 1997) . These colonial animals make good subjects for bioimmuration because their small-sized zooids can be rapidly overgrown before post-mortem deterioration. Each bioimmured fossil records the condition of the colony over a period of time as zooids become progressively overgrown. Upright structures, such as peristomes and erect branches, are flattened down against the substrate parallel to the local direction of overgrowth. Permineralisation of soft parts by pyrite or phosphate often accompanies bioimmuration (e.g., Todd and Taylor, 1992) , possibly facilitated by the enclosed microenvironment of the sandwiched epibiont. Exceptional preservation of articulated animals (stalked barnacles) and soft parts of skeletonised organisms (e.g., brachiopod setae) may also result from bioimmuration (Taylor and Todd, 2001 ). Because the process of bioimmuration resembles the action of a moving flatbed scanner in making an incremental recording, it is potentially possible to use bioimmurations to investigate short-term succession on hard substrates: the youngest parts of the bioimmurer sample the sclerobiont community at an earlier successional stage than the older parts.",

Epibiont shadows of soft-bodied ctenostome bryozoans from the Upper Jurassic are formed because the bryozoan zooids protected the shell substrate beneath them from attack by microendoliths whereas the shell all around the zooids was bored and is noticeably whiter in the fossils.

Rasmussen and Brett (1985) examined the modern cryptic encrusting biotas in submarine caves and on the undersides of ledges offshore of St. Croix, Virgin Islands. They showed that, at least with modern communities, large taphonomic losses occur on the way to preservation. Up to 85% of original area covered is lost, and up to 62% of original species richness. It is not only the non-preservation of soft-bodied forms which accounts for this deficit, but later successional forms may erase traces of the earlier colonists. In addition, the early successional species in this community tended to have mineralised skeletons whereas later species did not. Therefore, the fossil record would be biased towards the former. A taphonomic study by Zuschin et al. (1999) (see also Zuschin and Pervesler, 1996) in the Adriatic demonstrated the expected loss of organisms such as ascidians, anemones and demosponges in the death assemblage, as well as vagile forms with articulated skeletons. Another study in the Adriatic (Nebelsick et al., 1997) modeled the taphonomic processes effecting the tests of dead echinoids and noted how soft-bodied hydrozoans, sponges and ascidians would be lost to the fossil record.",

In the case of encrusted pectinid shells collected from near San Juan Island, Washington, Lescinsky (1993) found that external surfaces of live bivalves were dominated by sponges and agglutinated worms, both having a low preservation potential, plus some barnacles. Little indication of these symbionts is likely to survive into the fossil record. By contrast, the encrusting biota on dead shells consisted predominantly of serpulid worms and bryozoans having good preservational potentials. McKinney (1996) studied encrusters on disarticulated bivalve shells from Bogue Sound, North Carolina, recording the species identifiable before and after hypochlorite treatment which removed those species not expected to survive fossilisation. Bleaching reduced the 23 taxa to 8, with the loss not only of encrusting sponges but also of erect species which formed the highest tiers of suspension feeders in the living community. The area of valve encrustation declined by up to 25%.",

Domichnial (dwelling) borings appear in Lower Cambrian as the simple, cylindrical Trypanites, which was probably produced by many worm-like organisms over time (Kobluk et al., 1978) . These borings are the most common in the Palaeozoic, penetrating calcareous shells, hardgrounds, and carbonate rockgrounds (Palmer, 1982; . Other borings appear in the Palaeozoic, such as Petroxestes (Fig. 3A) , Palaeosabella (Fig. 3B) , Rogerella, Gastrochaenolites ( Fig. 3D ) and various ''sponge'' borings, but they are rare. Mesozoic macroboring is very different in intensity and style. Bivalve borings, especially Gastrochaenolites, are abundant on carbonate hard substrates from the Jurassic to the Recent, as are sponge borings such as Entobia and grazing traces like Gnathichnus. Borings become so common that the substrates themselves are rapidly degraded, especially in tropical and subtropical environments (see for Jurassic examples Andersson, 1979; Chudzikiewicz and Wieczorek, 1985; Gruszczynski, 1986; Garcia et al., 1989; F\u00fcrsich et al., 1994; Bertling, 1999b) . This infaunalisation on hard substrates may be a response to the rise of predators known as the Mesozoic Marine Revolution (Vermeij, 1977 (Vermeij, , 1978 (Vermeij, , 1987 . The equivalent infaunalisation within soft substrates has been thoroughly discussed (Stanley, 1977; Thayer, 1979 Thayer, , 1983 , but this hard substrate pattern in the Mesozoic needs further elucidation (Morton, 1990; . In the Cenozoic, bioerosion rates are especially high on carbonate substrates, with the main borers being bivalves (Kleemann, 1996) , sponges (see Bromley and D'Alessandro, 1984) and polychaete worms (see Bromley and D'Alessandro, 1983) . Perry and Bertling (2000) examined Mesozoic to Recent trends in macroboring in coral reefs, concluding that overall intensity of boring has increased through time. They also described marked changes in the composition of boring communities: bivalves and 'worms' initially dominated (at least until the Late Cretaceous) but were of secondary importance to sponges from the Early Miocene onwards.

The first reported predatory borings are simple round holes in Cloudina skeletons of the Late Precambrian (Bengtson and Zhao, 1992) . There are similar holes in Cambrian brachiopod shells which appear to be predatory (Conway Morris and Bengtson, 1994) . It has proven very difficult to distinguish predatory from domichnial borings in the Ordovician (see Richards and Shabica, 1969; Kaplan and Baumiller, 2000; Wilson and Palmer, 2001) . In fact, the earliest post-Cambrian predatory borings may be the work of naticid-like gastropods in the Devonian (see Leighton, 2001 ). Predatory borings increase in abundance and diversity in the Carboniferous (Baumiller et al., 1999) , a trend which continues through the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.

Thereafter, encrusters show two distinct peaks of diversity and abundance. Those on upward-facing, shallow water carbonate hardgrounds peaked in diversity and abundance in the Late Ordovician and the Jurassic -Cretaceous (Palmer, 1982; . These peaks are coincident with the bimodal abundance of hardgrounds during ''calcite sea'' times and so may represent a significant sampling bias. Encrusters on organic hard substrates peak in species richness during the Silurian -Devonian and the Jurassic. Lescinsky (2001) points out that this pattern may be biased by preferential description of high-diversity assemblages during these intervals, but nevertheless it accords with our experience in the field. More work is necessary to better delineate these diversity patterns. We especially need detailed studies of encrusting assemblages in the Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic.",

                "text": "Carbonate hardground encrusters show an increase in external skeletalisation from the Palaeozoic through the Mesozoic (Palmer, 1982; . Examples include trends in the dominant bryozoans (from groups like trepostomes, where the colony surface was invested by soft tissues, to most cyclostomes and cheilostomes with mineralised outer walls), in the reduction of adpressed echinoderms such as edrioasteroids, and in the appearance of abundant and well-skeletalised encrusting bivalves, brachiopods and serpulid worms in the Mesozoic. This increase in skeletal protection may have been a response to rising levels of predation, especially during the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. Hardground communities also show a rough increase in tiering, especially if borings are considered. Later Palaeozoic hardgrounds, for example, have more erect bryozoans such as fenestrates than their middle and early Palaeozoic equivalents. Jurassic and Cretaceous hardgrounds, though, have fewer erect forms and tend to be dominated by low encrusters like oysters and plicatulids. These same hardgrounds, however, also often have deeper tiers of diverse borings than any preceding them. Lescinsky (2001) has provided the best summary of historical trends in epibiont communities, most of which are consistent with those outlined above on hardgrounds. Epibionts on shells are better known than hardground encrusters in the crucial intervals of the later Palaeozoic -early Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. Lescinsky (1997) , for example, showed that with careful study of many bulk samples, diversity trends can be delineated. He postulated that peaks in epibiont diversity may be related to high levels of nutrient supply and hence productivity. Taylor and Michal\u00edk (1991) , in a rare study of Triassic skeletobionts, demonstrated that most of the common encrusting groups of the Mesozoic appeared by at least the Late Triassic.",

Cryptic spaces provide additional living space and a refuge from most predators and physical disturbance. The price cryptic organisms pay for this habitat includes less light and sometimes lower levels of nutrients (Gischler and Ginsburg, 1996) . Cryptic spaces have varied in their type, availability and abundance over time, and thus cryptic fossil communities will have irregular distributions through the geologic record. Cambrian crypts were most often in archaeocyath reefs and algal mounds, and they tended to be small and ephemeral. Ordovician through Early Carboniferous cavities were primarily formed under hardgrounds and large, massive skeletons like those of tabulate corals and stromatoporoids. Pennsylvanian and Permian reefs provided a large amount of cryptic space within their frameworks, hosting a significant portion of their total diversity. The Middle and Late Mesozoic showed again the importance of hardgrounds for providing cryptic space on carbonate shelves. Modern coral reefs today may have between 30% and 75% of their volume taken up by cavities, and the surface area of these cavities may be two to three times that of the exposed portions of the reef (Logan et al., 1984; Kobluk and van Soest, 1989; Gischler and Ginsburg, 1996) . An endoscopic study of cavities in Red Sea reefs revealed a sponge-dominated community of filter feeders that had a far greater biomass than the community of filter feeders on the reef surface (Richter et al., 2001) . Cryptic organisms are thus prominent in the history of hard substrate communities.",

That may be the case with modern ''hypercalcified'' sponges, which are sometimes thought to be relicts from the Mesozoic (Vacelet, 1983 (Vacelet, , 1991 . Taylor and Palmer (1994) described the preserved sessile fauna on the walls of exhumed Jurassic caves in western France. They found thrombolitic structures and abundant calcified demosponges, calcisponges, thecideidine brachiopods, serpulids, cyclostome bryozoans, and cemented bivalves. The microbes which formed the thrombolites in the Jurassic were present in open and cryptic spaces; today they are confined to caves, meaning they could be considered relict. The other organisms, though, may have always been cryptic and thus not truly relict today. Thecideidine brachiopods, for example, were common in Jurassic caves and other cavities (Taylor and Palmer, 1994; Wilson, 1998) and are just as common today in similar habitats (Harmelin et al., 1985) .",

It is possible that the pervasive lithification of carbonate sediment seafloors at this time provided a selective pressure for echinoderms which could attach to hard substrates, and thus the hardgrounds dramatically widened the hard substrate niche long before shelly substrates became common. The echinoderm stereom structure also promoted rapid substrate cementation. There may be a similar story for the Early Ordovician radiation of bryozoans. Some of the earliest bryozoans have large attachment bases (Hu and Spjeldnaes, 1991) ; suggested that these bases are adaptations for attachment to hardgrounds. Fig. 43 .

( , 1992 showed that hardgrounds and reworked concretions were critical to understanding the basinal history of a Jurassic sequence in western India. Fookes (1995) used such hardgrounds to sort out the sequence stratigraphy of an Upper Jurassic reef complex in eastern France. He could recognise the surfaces because they were ''perforated'' by ''cylindrical bioerosions'' (probably Trypanites), and because of pervasive mineralisation by what appears to be authigenic glauconite (Fookes, 1995, p. 136) . Wilson et al. (1998a,b ) used a similar bioeroded and encrusted surface (though not a hardground) to detect an otherwise unknown interglacial eustatic sea-level change in Late Pleistocene (Eemian) coral reefs of the Bahamas. This disconformity had gone unrecognised because the sediments and fossils are so similar above and below it; it was only revealed when blasting exposed large Gastrochaenolites. Hesselbo and demonstrated that a regional discontinuity within Lower Jurassic marine mudstones was marked by bored and encrusted septarian concretions. The hiatus associated with these hard substrates included three ammonite subzones. The same horizon has been the subject of a recent debate as to whether or not they represent a sea level fall (Hallam, 1999; Coe et al., 2000) . Siggerud et al. (2000) demonstrated the utility of bored limestone pebbles for interpreting wave-ravinement surfaces within an Eocene transgressive systems tract in northeastern Spain.",

Various workers have deduced numerous tectonically produced local sea level changes in the Holocene by examining patterns of bioerosion and encrustation, particularly by light-sensitive coralline algae (Laborel, 1979a,b; Papageorgiou et al., 1993; Laborel-Deguen, 1994, 1995; Pirazzoli et al., 1994 Pirazzoli et al., , 1996 Laborel et al., , 1999 Sartoretto et al., 1996) . Such work in the Mediterranean has been especially important for detecting and estimating the magnitude of historical seismic events (Papageorgiou et al., 1993; Pirazzoli et al., 1994) , which has immediate applications in archaeology. Distinctive assemblages of sessile organisms, including barnacles, can be used to recognise the positions of ancient intertidal zones and hence to chart sea-level changes (Baker et al., 2001 ).",

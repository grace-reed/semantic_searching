The molecular pathways underlying rapid adaptive phenotypic responses to global change remain poorly understood. Here[ _ T D $ D I F F ] , we highlight the relevance of two environment-sensitive molecular elements: transposable elements (TEs) and epigenetic components (ECs). We first outline the sensitivity of these elements to global change stressors and review how they interact with each other. We then propose an integrative molecular engine coupling TEs and ECs and allowing organisms to fine-tune phenotypes in a real-time fashion, adjust the production of phenotypic and genetic variation, and produce heritable phenotypes with different levels of transmission fidelity. We finally discuss the implications of this molecular engine in the context of global change.",

We build on these findings to propose that TEs and ECs can be integrated into a single mechanistic engine potentially permitting organisms to rapidly and lastingly cope with global change.

For instance, rapid physiological acclimation in the Antarctic polychaete Spiophanes tcherniai in response to warm stress is associated with modifications in global DNA methylation patterns [35] . Another example concerns the induction of drug resistance (i.e., hycanthone) in clones of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni previously exposed to sublethal doses [36] . The induced resistance was associated with several histone modifications over the genome and, more particularly, in the gene SmMRP1 encoding a multidrug-resistance-associated protein [36] . These examples illustrate how [ 8 _ T D $ D I F F ] ECs can promote acclimation to global change stressors. Patterns of DNA methylation can also persist across generations and produce heritable phenotypic changes [37] [38] [39] [40] . For instance, Cortijo et al. [38] demonstrated that specific heritable methylation patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana experimental strains accounted for 60-90% of the heritability for flowering time and primary root length. In animals most (but not all) covalent modifications at nucleotides and histone tails are reset in primordial germ cells and in the zygote after fertilization (i.e., epigenetic reprogramming), hence limitingbut not completely preventingthe transmission of epigenetic marks to subsequent generations [39] [40] [41] . For instance, Anway et al. [39] demonstrated that environmental toxins induce heritable altered DNA methylation patterns associated with male infertility in exposed adult rats that are transmitted over at least four subsequent generations unexposed to the stress.",

Particularly, TEs escaping epigenetic silencing might proliferate and contribute to the spread of DNA fragments that can themselves be targeted by subsequent epigenetic regulation [9, 45] . In mice, the insertion of an intracisternal A particle retrotransposon (IAP) upstream of the Agouti gene causes a shift from a wild-type agouti phenotype to a yellow coat phenotype. Yet, when the inserted IAP is silenced through hypermethylation, the agouti phenotype is partly recovered [46] . Interestingly, the methylated status of the IAP element is sensitive to bisphenol A, a widely used chemical in the plastic industries [47] . Neonatal exposure to bisphenol A decreases the methylation of the IAP element, hence switching on its transcriptional activity, resulting in mice expressing the yellow phenotype [47] . . Interestingly, several ncRNAs are encoded by TEs or by endogenous genes that are likely to be derived from TEs [48, 49] . Thus, TEs are key genomic components encoding elements involved in the epigenetic machinery [49] . Another aspect of ncRNAs encoded by TEs is that they can act to repress the proliferation of the TEs from which they originate following a sequence complementary match (i.e., TE silencing) [50] . Thus, epigenetically induced controls on the activities of ncRNAs constitute a pathway to modulate TE activities [49] .",

First, ECs can blindly increase the range of phenotypes relative to environmental changes at the population level, hence randomly generating variants on which selection can act [51] ( Figure 2A ). Second, phenotypes can adjust to (and better fit) the novel environment if [ _ T D $ D I F F ] ECs reveal hidden phenotypes that are genetically encoded and historically present in the population ( Figure 2B ), hence constituting 'environmentally directed' responses of organisms to environmental changes [51] . ECs probably play a major role in storing genetic information for particular phenotypes in a silent state as long as epigenetic marks are faithfully transmitted across generations, hence generating so-called hidden genetic variation [52] .

Moreover, environmentally induced epigenetic changes might also generate transgenerational phenotypic changes by activating TEs, which in turn generates genomic modifications. New phenotypic variants originating from TE mobilization in the germline are stably embedded within the DNA sequence and can therefore be efficiently selected for. Yet, newly inserted TEs constitute specific targets for epigenetic regulation [9] , so that emerging phenotypes resulting from TE mobilization might be at least partly reversible through postinsertional TE epigenetic regulation [47] . As a result, the interplay between EC and TE activity not only generates new phenotypes but also provides new regulatory pathways to modulate the expression of emerging phenotypes [9] and thus appears to be a major driver for the evolution of epigenetically controlled reaction norms.",

Although still controversial, there is increasing empirical support for this idea [6, 40, 62] .

Recent studies partially tackled this question by revealing the existence of circulating ncRNAs expressed in neurons and triggering changes in epigenetic patterns in the distant germline that remain present 25 generations later [62] . In plants, siRNAs expressed in shoot cells (i.e., from photosynthetic organs) can move to root cells (i.e., water-providing organs) and modify DNA methylation profiles in the latter cells, hence providing a coordinating system between functional organs [63] . Similarly, expressed miRNAs in stressed somatic cells can move to germ cells and locally modulate [ 8 _ T D $ D I F F ] ECs, and eventually activate TEs [64] (dashed arrows in Figure 1 ).

TEs and ECs have already been proposed as key players in fostering phenotypic and biological innovations during major ecological transitions [11] [12] [13] [14] . Global change is considered such an ongoing major ecological transition [ The reality of this TE-EC engine is supported by accruing scientific evidence that TEs and ECs are sensitive to several global change stressors and are triggering genomic and phenotypic responses to these stressors. Although the individual effects of TEs and ECs on rapid phenotypic adaptation are increasingly acknowledged [4, 65] , much is to be done to demonstrate causal links between the TE-EC engine and organisms' responses to global change (see Outstanding Questions). To date, rapid and on-demand adaptation to global change has been largely proved in the bacteria world. In particular, integrons associated with TEs are key players in the emergence of antibiotic-multiresistant bacteria, which [ 3 2 _ T D $ D I F F ] constitutes a major public health concern [66] . response to global change we believe organisms should display four characteristics; they must: (i) be sensitive to global change stressors (e.g., chemicals, global warming); (ii) respond phenotypically to these stressors; (iii) be easy to manipulate under experimental conditions; and (iv) dispose of genomic resources to facilitate the monitoring of genomic changes. We propose a series of three organisms (see below) sharing these characteristics that could pioneer empirical research on the links between the TE-[ 1 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] EC engine and responses to global change.",

First, the increasing availability of biotechnologies and databases revealing the genomic distribution of TEs and ECs in a wide range of organisms [67, 68] should help in determining the extent to which these elements are distributed among the tree of life and how they jointly interact with the genomes. Second, a powerful approach to establish causalities implies the use of experimental evolution jointly monitoring modifications at the phenotypic and genomic levels (with a focus on the TE-[ 1 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] EC machinery) in organisms challenged with global change stressors. Asexual organisms would be particularly relevant because the possible effects of gene rearrangements[ 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] , other than those induced by TEs, on emerging phenotypes are drastically reduced. Third, several molecular engineering tools could help demonstrate the causality between the TE-[ 1 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] EC engine and organisms' responses to global change. For instance, the causal implication of [ 8 _ T D $ D I F F ] ECs in inbreeding depression was established in the plant Scabiosa columbaria where a demethylating agent (i.e., 5-azacytidine) restored depressed traits in inbred seeds [69] (see also [70] for a review on molecular engineering involving TEs).",

(A) Under stress,[ _ T D $ D I F F ] the activation of the TE-EC engine in somatic cells induces plastic responses through: (i) DNA methylation and/or modifications of histone tails; (ii) transcription of TE-encoded regulatory noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs); and (iii) lifting of epigenetic silencing and mobilization of TEs in somatic cells, leading to somatic mosaicism. (B) Stress induces epigenetic modifications in germline cells. The resulting phenotypes can be stabilized over generations (transgenerational epigenetic inheritance) through self-reinforcing epigenetic pathways (Box 1). Stress perceived in somatic cells can also induce the production of circulating ncRNAs that may modify the epigenome of remote germline cells [dashed arrow from (A) to (B)]. (C) Stress can induce the lifting of epigenetic silencing of TEs in germinal cells, resulting in the mobilization of TEs across the genome. The resulting phenotypes are thus transmitted to the next generations. However, because newly inserted TEs are targets for epigenetic silencing, the resulting heritable phenotypes are expected to be, in some cases, reversible. Similarly to (B), stress perceived in somatic cells can induce the production of circulating ncRNAs that may modify the epigenome of remote germline cells [dashed arrow from (A) to (C)]. (D) Stress can induce modifications of epigenetic patterns that can result in irreversible genomic changes either directly (mutagenic effect of epigenetic patterns) or indirectly through the release of epigenetic silencing of TEs and the resulting mobilization of TEs throughout the genome. As in (B) and (C), stress perceived in somatic cells can induce the production of circulating ncRNAs that may modify the epigenome of remote germline cells [dashed arrow from (A) to (D)]. Evolutionary Outcomes of Epigenetically Induced Phenotypic Plasticity Under Stress. Upper panels:Individual reaction norms for a given phenotypic trait when the environment changes from E1 to E2. Black and grey dots are individual phenotypic trait values in E1 and E2, respectively. The population distributions of phenotypes in E1 and E2 are represented by the black and grey distributions respectively on the right of each panel. Arrows represent changes in the distribution of phenotypes at the population level after environmental changes. Lower panels: The evolutionary outcomes of the resulting phenotypic changes in terms of fitness at the individual (dots) and population (distributions on the right of each panel) level. (A) Epigenetic changes increase trait variance resulting in an increased fitness variance at the population level. Individuals with the optimal reaction norm are selected by natural selection. (B) Epigenetic changes affect the mean (but not the variance) of the trait towards a new optimum. (C) Epigenetic changes decrease trait variance around a new optimal value, which may lead to phenotypic canalization.",

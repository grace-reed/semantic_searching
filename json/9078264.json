Some extant groups are able to synthesize all of the 20 protein amino acids (plants, and many fungi, bacteria and Protista ; Table 1 ). All animals studied so far, however, lack a number of amino acid synthetic pathways, or the rates of synthesis of these amino acids are insufficient to meet metabolic needs. These amino acids, termed essential, must be obtained by animals from their environment (e.g. food). All vertebrates have the same nine essential amino acids (threonine, valine, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, histidine, lysine and tryptophan), and some have additional essential amino acids (Table 1) . More variability exists within the invertebrates : some (but not all) representatives of the Crustacea, Mollusca and Nematoda have been attributed with the ability to synthesize one or more of the vertebrate essential amino acids (Table 1) . One phylum for which capabilities for amino acid synthesis had not yet been studied was the Cnidaria. The purpose of this study was therefore to examine amino acid synthesis within the order Scleractinia.",

                "text": "Overall, available information on amino acid synthesis shows that the pattern of essential compared with non-essential amino acids is similar among most Metazoa. Possible explanations for this similarity are : (1) animals evolved from early protozoan groups that had already lost or never acquired all the amino acid synthetic pathways ; (2) the loss of these pathways occurred early in the evolution of the Metazoa ; or (3) certain amino acid synthetic pathways may be more prone to loss than others. In general, essential amino acids are those with long, complex synthetic pathways. Random deleterious mutations may be more likely to occur in pathways with many steps than in those with few steps. The cnidarians are among the most primitive extant metazoans in most phylogenetic schema (see, for example, [1] [2] [3] ). In this regard, their pattern of amino acid synthetic abilities amino acids. A total of 17 amino acids, including hydroxyproline, were distinguishable by the techniques used. Of these, only threonine was not found radiolabelled in any of the samples. We could not detect tryptophan or cysteine, nor distinguish between the amino acid pairs glutamic acid and glutamine, or aspartic acid and asparagine. Eight amino acids normally considered essential for animals were made by the five corals tested, although some of them were made only in small quantities. These eight amino acids are valine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine histidine, methionine and lysine. The ability of cnidarians to synthesize these amino acids could be yet another indicator of a separate evolutionary history of the cnidarians from the rest of the Metazoa. might be indicative of their divergence from other metazoan groups relative to the loss of amino acid synthetic pathways.",

Two procedures were used to remove externally attached bacteria : first, immediately before incubation with the radiolabelled compounds, each coral was rinsed vigorously in three successive dishes of sea water filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter ; secondly, before tissue removal was begun (see below), the living surface of each coral was squirted with a stream of cold deionized water until the coral began to release streams of mucus, which was assumed to carry with it surface bacteria. The efficiency of these procedures was assessed twice, first with a set of laboratorymaintained samples of M. fa eolata, and the second time with freshly collected samples of this species from the Florida Keys. The procedures tested were : (1) 0.22 \u00b5m filtration of the sea water, (2) one to five vigorous rinses of the coral in filtered sea water, (3) squirt-bottle rinses of the coral surfaces with chilled deionized water, (4) successive rinses in filtered sea water, followed by a rinse in deionized water, and (5) incubation with either 500 \u00b5g\\ml gentamicin or 500 \u00b5g\\ml streptomycin for 30 min. Bacterial numbers in the sea water before and after filtering were assessed by plating 250 \u00b5l samples of unfiltered and filtered sea water on agar plates (fortified seawater media : 0.05 g of yeast extract, 0.5 g of tryptone, 0.1 g of sodium glycerophosphate and 12.0 g of noble agar per litre of sea water ; [6a] ). The effectiveness of each of the various coral rinses was assessed by gently pressing the living surface of each coral on an agar plate. Untreated M. fa eolata samples served as controls.",

Although translocation of radiolabelled amino acids from the algae to the animal was not assessed in these experiments, the magnitude of their potential contribution was estimated from the percentage of the total radiolabel that was in the algal pellet. Debris pelleted from coral homogenates of the three zooxanthellate species initially contained only 7-13 % of the radiolabel taken up by the whole (animal plus algae) coral association. After washing three times with filtered sea water, these pellets contained only 1-9 % of the total radiolabel. Although washing removed most of the animal debris from the pellets, intact nematocysts and larger cell fragments of animal origin were still visible when examined under a microscope. Thus much of the radiolabel remaining in these pellets could be accounted for by animal contaminants. In addition, the percentage of total radiolabel in the animal supernatant remained unchanged over the 24 h sampling period for the three zooxanthellate species. This contrasts with results from studies with H\"%CO $ # \u2212 , where the animal fraction increases in activity over this time-frame owing to algal translocation (see, for example, [9] [10] [11] ). The small amount of radioactivity in the washed zooxanthellae pellets and the stability of the radiolabel content of these pellets, coupled with the fact that the algae are unlikely to take up much glucose, suggests that the zooxanthellae did not contribute much to the radiolabelled amino acids recovered from the zooxanthellate animal hosts.",

Acid hydrolysis converts glutamine into glutamate (the pair is referred to as Glx), asparagine into aspartic acid (the pair is referred to as Asx), and breaks down tryptophan completely, especially in the presence of carbohydrates [12] , which were plentiful in these samples. Cysteine is also susceptible to degradation in the presence of carbohydrates [12] . A small percentage of threonine and serine, 3 % and 6 % respectively, can be degraded during hydrolysis [12] .

The grand mean was then subtracted from each sample value, and the result divided by the grand standard deviation. This procedure results in the number of standard deviations by which each sample falls away from the grand mean. A Kruskal-Wallis two-way analysis of variance demonstrated that the patterns of amino acid distribution in the composite protein samples were not significantly different between the field-collected colonies of the five coral species, nor between the field-collected and laboratory-maintained colonies of M. fa eolata (P 0.05).",

The results of this study suggest that corals might be able to synthesize many protein amino acids that are thought to be essential in most noncnidarian Metazoa (Table 1 ). This assertion is not entirely new for the Metazoa. Evidence for the synthesis of amino acids usually considered essential also exists for some representatives of the the Crustacea, Mollusca and Nematoda (Table 1) . Interestingly, patterns of amino acid synthesis seem to vary by species rather than by phylum, and might indicate biochemical adaptation of individual organisms. However, the variable patterns of amino acid synthetic abilities within and among groups might also be an artifact of experimental design, as illustrated by two different patterns of amino acid synthesis reported for the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae. Dougherty et al. [16] and Nichols et al. [17] reported that none of the essential amino acids could be synthesized by C. briggsae, but in a later study Rothstein and Tomlinson [18] reported that in axenic culture this nematode could synthesize Tyr, Thr, Val, Met, Leu, Ile, His and Lys de no o. Even Rothstein and Tomlinson [18] , however, observed that synthesis of these amino acids by C. briggsae was curtailed in the presence of penicillin and streptomycin, and that the nematode was unable to grow or reproduce on anything other than complete media. Eight amino acids putatively synthesized by these corals (Val, Ile, Leu, Tyr, Phe, His, Met and Lys) cannot be synthesized by most Metazoa (Table 1 ). This finding might not be as novel as it first seems when recent findings relating to cnidarian phylogeny are considered. Phylogenetic trees based on 18 S rRNA sequences suggest the Cnidaria might be on an early or separate branch from the rest of the metazoans [1] [2] [3] . According to these phylogenetic reconstructions, the Cnidaria are more closely related to the plants, fungi and ciliates than to other metazoans. Schlichter et al. [19] also suggested that the Cnidaria are primitive evolutionarily because their amino acid uptake sites are on their external rather than their internal surfaces. A different or early evolutionary origin of the Cnidaria is consistent with our observations and suggests that the Cnidaria might have diverged from other metazoans before amino acid synthesis pathways were lost.",

Undoubtedly some bacteria were present on the surface of the corals in spite of the rinsing techniques, and no effort was made to remove or inactivate those in polyp coelenterons. Furthermore two of the coral species used, Ac. cer icornis and Porites di aricata, have colonies of rod-shaped bacteria within their tissues that are probably endosymbionts of some sort ( [32] , and A. M. Szmant, unpublished work). Such bacterial colonies have not been found, however, in the other three species used in these experiments (A. M. Szmant, unpublished work) . Given that neither the amount of radiolabelled-glucose uptake nor the pattern of amino acid radiolabelling differed between the two coral species with bacterial colonies and the three without, it can be reasoned that the bacterial colonies were not responsible for a significant amount of the amino acid synthesis. The same logic cannot be applied to bacteria living on internal or external surfaces of the coral tissues. However, tests of the rinsing techniques suggest that 90 % or more of the bacteria were eliminated from external surfaces, and given the relatively large biomass of coral it is unlikely that bacteria remaining on the exterior coral surfaces, together with coelenteric bacteria, could have been responsible for the rather substantial amount of amino acid synthesis from radiolabelled glucose, even considering that bacteria have higher metabolic rates than corals. Even so, we made a rough calculation of the amount of radiolabelled glucose that could have been taken up by surface bacteria, based on (1) bacterial densities on the surface of scleractinian corals (276 cells\\cm#) [33] , (2) K m and V max for the uptake of \uf764-glucose by an oligotrophic marine bacterium [34] , and (3) the experimental values of substrate concentration, incubation time and coral surface areas. Our calculated estimate for bacterial glucose uptake is 0.1 % of the administered radiolabel. This value is likely to be an overestimate because we used the minimum K m and maximum V max from Nissen et al. [34] (adjusted for bacterial cell number), and the maximum substrate concentration for all the incubations. Furthermore we assumed that substrate concentration was constant throughout the incubation period, whereas it decreased by 21-70 %, and we did not account for the removal of surface bacteria by our pre-rinsing techniques. In addition, much of the radiolabelled glucose taken up by bacteria would undoubtedly have been used for bacterial respiration and not for the synthesis of amino acids. Lastly, the amount of radioactivity recovered in the distilled-water rinses (which included coral mucus and associated bacteria) was small, indicating that most of the radiolabelled glucose was taken up directly by the coral.",

The eight ' essential ' amino acids synthesized by these corals are produced from intermediates from all three of these pathways. Valine and isoleucine are synthesized by the same enzymes but from different precursors, and leucine is synthesized by a similar series of reactions. Tyrosine and phenylalanine are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate shunt, and therefore radiolabel in these two amino acids could have been derived from either pathway. Histidine, however, is synthesized entirely from an intermediate in the pentose phosphate shunt, which indicates that radiolabelled glucose was moved through this pathway. Glutamic acid can be synthesized from \u03b1oxoglutarate by the addition of ammonia by the action of glutamate dehydrogenase. In animals, however, glutamate dehydrogenase is generally considered to play a larger role in the oxidation of glutamic acid than in its synthesis [36] . Glutamic acid is usually made by the transamination of \u03b1-oxoglutarate and other amino acids, and incorporation of ammonia into amino acids is mediated by the action of glutamine synthetase. Recovery of radiolabel in glutamine, arginine and proline, which are synthesized from glutamic acid, as well as in glutamic acid, indicates the action of glutamate dehydrogenase in the direction towards glutamic acid synthesis. Miller and Yellowlees [37] noted a high affinity of coral-tissue glutamate dehydrogenase for ammonium, which is consistent with glutamate dehydrogenasemediated glutamic acid synthesis. Furthermore, in other experiments both M. fa eolata and Ac. cer icornis assimilated significant amounts of \"&NH % into animal tissue after being maintained in total darkness for 48 h, by which time their zooxanthellae no longer took up nutrients ( [7] , and A.

It remains to be determined whether attached or coelenteric bacteria are responsible for some of the synthesis. Even if bacteria are in fact responsible for the synthesis, however, this finding is significant from an ecological-unit perspective. If coral gut bacteria or bacterial endosymbionts regularly convert sugars (which reef corals receive from their zooxanthellae) into amino acids, and if corals have access to bacterial products (e.g. digestion of bacteria or bacterial excretion of amino acids into the coelenteron), then in a functional sense corals have a previously unaccounted-for source of protein and amino acids. Despite the apparent ability of corals to synthesize some essential amino acids, rates of amino acid synthesis seem to be greater for those amino acids that are typically non-essential, and slower for those amino acids that are typically essential, with the exception of histidine. The role of synthesis in satisfying metabolic requirements for ' essential ' amino acids still needs to be determined.",

    "abstract": "A method was developed for the quantitative detection of pathogenic human enteroviruses from surface waters in the Florida Keys using Taqman (R) one-step Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with the Model 7700 ABI Prism (R) Sequence Detection System. Viruses were directly extracted from unconcentrated grab samples of seawater, from seawater concentrated by vortex flow filtration using a 100 kD filter and from sponge tissue. Total RNA was extracted from the samples, purified and concentrated using spin-column chromatography. A 192-196 base pair portion of the 5 0 untranscribed region was amplified from these extracts. Enterovirus concentrations were estimated using real-time RT-PCR technology. Nine of 15 sample sites or 60% were positive for the presence of pathogenic human enteroviruses. Considering only near-shore sites, 69% were positive with viral concentrations ranging from 9.3 viruses/ml to 83 viruses/g of sponge tissue (uncorrected for extraction efficiency). Certain amplicons were selected for cloning and sequencing for identification. Three strains of waterborne enteroviruses were identified as Coxsackievirus A9, Coxsackievirus A16, and Poliovirus Sabin type 1. Time and cost efficiency of this one-step real-time RT-PCR methodology makes this an ideal technique to detect, quantitate and identify pathogenic enteroviruses in recreational waters.",

Reports of heavy algal growth and episodes of coral bleaching [3, 4] have prompted several studies of surface water quality [5] [6] [7] . These reports have provided evidence that increased nutrification of these waters brought about by anthropogenic processes have resulted in the deterioration of water quality and coral reef health [5] [6] [7] .",

Analysis of this tree showed it to be in general agreement with some previously published enterovirus phylogenies [36, 37] but in disagreement with others [38, 39] . Two major clades were evident, a large clade containing Coxsackie A16, the Coxsackie B viruses, the Echoviruses and Enterovirus 71 and a smaller clade comprised of the Polioviruses, Coxsackie A21, Coxsackie 24 and Enterovirus 70. Huttunen et al. [36] Fig. 3 . A neighbor-joining tree derived from an alignment of 196 base pairs of the 5 0 UTR from enteroviral standards and our specimens from the Florida Keys. major capsid proteins. The capsid protein dendrograms found Coxsackie A16 and Enterovirus 70 to be in a third clade. Our tree depicts Coxsackie A21 and Enterovirus as sister-group to the remainder of the Poliovirus/ Coxsackie A virus clade in agreement with Muir et al. [37] . Oberste et al. [39] utilized the 5 0 end of the VP2 gene to derive a phylogenetic tree of all enterovirus serotypes. Their tree produced three major clades and placed [20] shows a log/log relationship between cell culture data and quantitative RT-PCR data Fig. 4 . By solving for the X -intercept of the regression equation, one infective unit (MPNCU) corresponds to 55 viral copies detectable by RT-PCR (Fig. 4) . Although it has been long known that many more environmental samples are often positive by PCR than cell culture, this is the first attempt to quantify the relationship between the two methods. Although the samples from the Monpoeho et al. [20] were from sludge and not surface waters, it may be that their findings can be used to relate infectivity to a PCR quantified viral abundance. This is an important exercise because quantitative real-time PCR data can be obtained much faster (o1 day) than cell culture results (weeks to months). It is well known that compromised viral particles and nucleic acids will result in detection by PCR but not by cell culture. It may be that a real-time PCR value of 55 particles in a sample is necessary to have the probability of one infectious particle present. To assess health risk of recreational contact with water containing enteroviral particles, the amount of water ingested by any activity times the concentration of infectious particles needs to be known. If swimmers ingest an average of 30-50 ml of water [40] then real-time PCR concentrations of enteroviruses should not exceed 1.10-1.83 PCR particles/ml, assuming that an infection can result from one ''viable'' (cell culture positive) viral particle. All of our positive samples in the Keys exceeded these concentrations. Other contact activities (jet-skiing, windsurfing, kayaking, etc.) probably result in less water ingestion and a lower risk and may be appropriate for canals and waterways similar to the ones tested in this study. Finally, sludge samples may be recalcitrant to inactivation compared to surface waters, where UV light and temperature may inactivate infectious viral particles at a faster rate. Sludge samples may also be more inhibitory to cell culture (or PCR) than surface waters, and a direct comparison of cell culture and PCR should be made. One such study in Sarasota, Florida found a high fidelity between PCR and cell culture data (88% of the PCR positive samples were also positive by cell culture; [41] ).",

An alternate explanation may be that our positive control (Polio Sabin 1) was identical in the 5 0 UTR to that used in immunizations, and therefore correctly detected such viruses shed into the water. Only amplification and sequencing of other portions of the genomes from the positive samples would verify or negate this hypothesis.",

Infections of S. marcescens are of great concern because of its increasing resistance towards conventional antibiotics. Quorum sensing (QS)-a cell to cell communication-system of S. marcescens acts as a global regulator of almost all the virulence factors and majorly its biofilm formation. Since, the QS system of S. marcescens directly accords to its pathogenesis, targeting QS system will provide an improved strategy to combat drug resistant pathogens. In the present study, QS system of S. marcescens has been used as target and its inhibition has been studied upon exposure to bioactives from coral associated bacteria (CAB). This study also emphasises the potential of CAB in producing bioactive agents with anti-QS and antibiofilm properties. Two CAB isolates CAB 23 and 41 have shown to inhibit biofilm formation and the production of QS dependent virulence factors like prodigiosin, protease, lipase and swarming motility. The study, on the whole explicates the potential of QS system as a target to treat drug resistant bacterial infections.",

                "text": "Serratia marcescens is a Gram negative opportunistic human pathogen responsible for an increasing number of chronic nosocomial infections. 1, 2 It produces a range of secreted products viz. proteases, nucleases, lipases, chitinases, the biosurfactant serrawettin and hemolysin that enhances the virulence of the organism apart from evading it from the host immune system. S. marcescens colonises intra-uterine catheters more habitually thereby causing hospital acquired urinary tract infections. Nosocomial infections of S. marcescens are of vast concern as many such causative agents are multidrug resistant. 1 The ability of S. marcescens to adhere and grow on the surface of medical devices is attributed by its biofilm formation. [3] [4] [5] Biofilms are a complex multicellular architecture, where the bacteria reside inside an extracellular matrix typically made up of exopolysaccharides, proteins and extracellular DNA. 6, 7 Bacteria growing as biofilms are tough to remove from the substratum and are highly resistant to common antibacterial agents and detergents. 7 Recent reports have shown that bacteria dwelling in biofilm are 1000folds more resistant to antibiotics as compared to their planktonic counterparts. 8, 9 The biofilm formation in S. marcescens is a major virulence factor which is controlled by its quorum sensing (QS) system. 10 QS system of S. marcescens controls various virulence factors apart from biofilm formation like swimming motility, swarming, production of biosurfactants, 11 nucleases and a pigment called prodigiosin. 12 It has wide variety of signalling molecules from C4-homoserine lactone (HSL) to C8-HSL. C4-HSL and C6-HSL regulate swimming motility and biofilm formation in S. marcescens, whereas C6-HSL, C7-HSL and C8-HSL regulate sliding motility, synthesis of biosurfactant, prodigiosin and nuclease. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Inability of S. marcescens to form biofilms and, to produce prodigiosin and other exoenzymes were explained in QS mutants that strongly infers the role of QS system in its pathogenesis. 1 At present, a therapy that efficiently target bacterial biofilms does not exist, since the biofilms are inherently resistant to conventional antibiotics. 18 This indicates the need for new sort of drugs active not only against planktonic bacteria but also against drug resistant biofilms. In the light of QS and its potent role in the virulence and pathogenesis of S. marcescens, QS system will be a convincing target to combat drug resistance and severe infections out of it. 7, 19 Anti-QS agents or quorum quenchers (QQ) are of interest since it exerts no selection pressure over the bacteria, that in turn results in resistance. The threat of resistance development with QQ is not common as it attenuates only the virulence factors but not the growth of the pathogen, facilitating its clearance by the host immune system. 20 A variety of bioactive agents, both natural and synthetic in nature were reported in the recent past that has significant antibiofilm activity against Gram positive and negative bacteria. 1, [21] [22] [23] In spite the need for novel QQs with antibiofilm activity against drug resistant bacterial pathogens like S. marcescens are in need, that prompted us to identify novel drug candidates with antibiofilm and anti-QS activity.",

This prompts us to embark on marine microbes, an unexplored environment with various bioactive potential. [24] [25] [26] Few studies have shown that marine bacteria produce bioactive agents which has not been reported from terrestrial ones. 20, [24] [25] [26] [27] The potential of bacteria (Marinobacter sp. and an aproteobacteria) associated with the corals to inhibit the QS dependent virulence factors in an environmental isolate of S. marcescens has been reported recently that further augmented our interest in exploring the CAB isolates. 28 Coral ecosystems hitherto unexplored reserve for microorganisms, are recently reported to have the potential producers of bioactive compounds. The likelihood of obtaining novel bioactive compounds from these coral ecosystems seems high, since many such microorganisms in this ecosystem has not been well characterised. In addition, coral associated bacteria (CAB) play a defensive role in coral reefs by producing secondary metabolites that effectively control the bacterial and fungal pathogens of the host. This as a milieu, the present study intended to assess the anti-QS and antibiofilm activities of a CAB against S. marcescens causing biofilm related infections in hospitalized individuals. This study for the first time reports the anti-QS and antibiofilm activity of marine isolates Delftia tsuruhatensis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia associated with the coral Acropora digitifera from the Gulf of Mannar biosphere reserve.",

CAB 23 and 41 at the concentrations of 1.5 and 2 mg mL \u00c01 , respectively significantly inhibited the production of the pigment prodigiosin to about 60% and 67%, respectively (Fig. 4a ). Production of other virulence factors like protease and lipase have also been inhibited to about 35% and 10%, respectively (Fig. 4b and c ). Increasing the concentration of the principal compound might boost the inhibitory activity of CAB extracts against the production of these virulence factors. Production of biofilm and prodigiosin has been significantly inhibited that suggests that CAB extracts targets the SmaIR QS system which controls the prodigiosin production. 13 CAB extracts have shown the reduction in swarming motility when treated with CAB 23 and 41(at the concentrations of 1.5 and 2 mg mL \u00c01 , respectively) to about 66% and 44%, respectively, which was evident through the direct observation of the plates (Fig. 5a and b) . Swarming assay plates have also shown the inability of S. marcescens to produce prodigiosin upon exposure to CAB extracts. S. marcescens is well known for its swarming motility and it was reported that swarming bacteria will move in multicellular structures and display an acquired resistance to broad spectrum of antibiotics. 42 Hence, CAB 23 and 41 with the potential of inhibiting the swarming motility will be a novel candidate for drugs against drug resistant bacteria.",

Inhibition of QS will be the gold standard method to combat diseases caused by drug resistant pathogens, since the conventional antibiotics that inhibits the growth of bacteria further increases the resistance. Inhibition of QS has no effect on the growth, than inhibiting the virulence of the bacteria, facilitating its clearance by host immune system. To the best of our knowledge this is the first ever report stating the efficacy of coral bacteria to inhibit the QS and biofilm formation in S. marcescens. Further exploration of such novel ecosystems will unveil bacteria with numerous bioactive potentials that can be utilised to address the problems concerning bacterial diseases. Figure 6 . Effect of CAB 23 and 41 on the CSH of S. marcescens. Both the extracts has no significant effect on the CSH of S. marcescens that infers that biofilm inhibition is only because of the anti-QS activity of CAB 23 and 41.",

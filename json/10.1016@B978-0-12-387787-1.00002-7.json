This reef complex extends 250 km southward from Yucatan, Mexico, into the Gulf of Honduras, most of it lying 20-40 km off the coast of Belize. A relatively unspoiled ecosystem, it features a great variety of habitats in close proximity, ranging from mangrove islands, seagrass meadows, and patch reefs in its lagoon to the barrier reef along the margin of the continental shelf. Among its varied macrobenthos, sponges stand out for their ubiquity, range of colours, rich species and biomass, and ecological importance; they populate rocky substrates, some sandy bottoms, and the subtidal stilt roots and peat banks of mangroves.",

At last count, 113 researchers (88 working on site) have focused on the biological and geological role of Porifera in Carrie Bow's reef communities, with the results reported in 125 scientific papers to date. The majority of these sponge studies have centred on systematics and faunistics, including quantitative distribution among the various habitats. Taxonomic approaches have ranged from basic morphology to fine structure, DNA barcoding, and ecological manipulations and culminated in a mini-workshop involving several experts on Caribbean Porifera. Ecological work has covered a broad spectrum as well: bioerosion, silica and nutrient cycling, symbiosis, mutualism, space competition, predation, disease, and the effects on sponge individuals and populations of environmental factors such as light, temperature, salinity, desiccation, substrate, and sedimentation. Many projects were enhanced by scientific illustration, laboratory studies of larvae settlement preferences and development, and investigations of microbial and invertebrate sponge associates, notably symbiotic cyanobacteria, parazoanthid epizoans, and crustacean and ophiuroid endobionts. Of the striking discoveries, the work on alpheid shrimps colonizing sponges off Carrie Bow Cay has yielded the first report of eusociality in marine organisms.",

Formerly British Honduras, it has been an independent state since 1981. In the north, west, and south, it is bordered by Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, respectively, and in the east by the Caribbean Sea. It shares with its neighbours the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, the largest such structure in the Western Hemisphere, which parallels Belize's coastline for some 220 km, nearly the entire length of the country. The shallow lagoon between the mainland and the reef ranges in width from to 40 km and serves as a protected shipping channel.

In the absence of the necessary infrastructure, tourism, too, was slow to develop, attracting mainly visitors on boats or bird watchers and scuba divers who did not mind roughing it a bit. Its remarkable marine environment soon gained the attention of eight marine scientists, including myself, at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Though diverse in our interests-from marine botany and invertebrate zoology to palaeobiology and sedimentology-we all saw a great need for information on the development and biology of coastal marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs, and could find no better place for studies of this nature than the reef systems off Belize, nearly untouched by pollution and only slightly affected by local fisheries. Their habitats also fitted perfectly my own central concern: the biology of reef sponges (Porifera), a prominent member of the reef system.",

There the reef lies about 25 km from the mainland, separated by a 15-m deep lagoon, and features a great variety of reef types alongside mangroves and seagrass meadows, with the nutrient-rich lagoon and oligotrophic ocean close by. In 1972 we established a field station on Carrie Bow Cay, a tiny island on the barrier reef made up of coral rubble (16 48.1 0 N, 88 04.9 0 W). At the time, we could not imagine how long-lasting and scientifically significant this \"temporary\" laboratory would become (R\u00fctzler and Macintyre, 1982a; R\u00fctzler, 2009) . In later years, starting about 1995, we expanded our research area to the Pelican Cays to the south. Part of the region our team helped to define (Figs. 3.1 and 3.2) has been designated the South Water Cay Marine Protected Area by the Belize government.",

As was apparent from the outset, sponges are the principal components of most habitats around Carrie Bow Cay, particularly the forereef (below a depth of 5 m, where it is less exposed to waves), patch reefs, mangroves, and seagrass meadows (Fig. 3.3) . Indeed, sponges are vastly richer in species, abundance, and biomass than even the reef-building corals. Through microbial symbionts, they also facilitate or contribute directly to significant processes, such as primary production and nitrification, water filtration and bacterial retention, and carbonate framework cementation and bioerosion. Moreover, the siliceous skeleton present in most species aids in the cycling of silica in carbonate environments. In addition, being sessile and unprotected by solid structures, many forms produce and release natural products of ecological importance. These considerable contributions, not to mention the dearth of information on them, sparked our efforts in many venues-the literature, field courses, workshops, international symposiato encourage colleagues and students to collaborate in our endeavours or to follow a similar path Feller, 1988, 1996; Feller and Sitnik, 1996; Macintyre and Aronson, 1997; Diaz and R\u00fctzler, 2001; R\u00fctzler, , 2009 .",

An additional aid to research, the station's environmental monitoring program provides semiannual records of benthos composition and production in selected reef, mangrove, and seagrass sites (following the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity-CARICOMPprotocol) and automatic and continuous readings of oceanographic conditions (Koltes et al., 1998; Opishinski et al., 2001) .

The other seven species were collected by the British Rosaura Expedition (1937-1938) but were not listed or described until much later (Burton, 1954) . They consisted of Thenea fenestrata Schmidt, Radiella sol Schmidt, and Dragmatyle topsenti Burton (now Eurypon topsenti (Burton)) collected from 900 m north of Turneffe Islands; Haliclona spiculosa Dendy (now Amphimedon spiculosa (Dendy)), H. tenerrima Burton, and Tedania anhelans Lieberkuehn (presumably T. ignis (Duchassaing and Michelotti)) from shallow water (2-3.5 m) at Indian Cay, Turneffe; and Hymeniacidon glabrata Burton from Belize City harbour (6 m). The bath-sponge varieties reported from many shallowwater locations along the coast of Belize included sheepswool (Hippospongia lachne (de Laubenfels), velvet (Hippospongia gossypina (Duchassaing and Michelotti)), and grass sponge (Spongia graminea Hyatt)-but none were of high commercial quality (Moore, 1910; Stuart, 1948) .",

In the mid-1990s, local fishermen guided us to the nearby Pelican Cays, a group of mangrove islands with deep, clear, craterlike ponds.

                "text": "Our study of this array of fresh material made clear that numerous Caribbean families and genera needed to be revised and revealed more than 30 new species, with many more still under investigation (Figs. 3.5 and 3.6). This work has been of great benefit to several chapters in the Systema Porifera monograph (Hooper and Van Soest, 2002) . In reviewing the Tetillidae, a difficult family because of its great diversity and the variability of spicules, we coupled field observations with close study of a large specimen series obtained by the Mineral Management Service (U.S. Department of Interior) during continental shelf surveys along the southeastern U.S. and Gulf of Mexico coasts in the early 1980s (R\u00fctzler, 1987; R\u00fctzler and Smith, 1992) . Although genera could be well defined by anatomical characteristics and the presence or absence of unusual accessory A B Figure 3 .4 Illustration of Coelosphaera biclavata, first sponge recorded from Belize. (A) The body (without fistules) is reported as 7 \u00c2 mm in diameters, the spicules (B) measure (left to right, top to bottom): isocheles, 13-17 mm; sigmas, 50 mm; rhaphids, 250 mm; tylotes, 300-500 mm. (Adapted from Priest, 1881; plate XXIII, partial.) spicules, some individuals lacked spicule types or combinations used to identify species-or these were too rare to show up in the tissue volume used for standard spicule preparations. Thus it is obviously advisable to study populations whenever possible, or at least take multiple microscopy samples from each specimen. Field experience from numerous West Indian locations-including Bermuda, the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and Belize-combined with highresolution (scanning electron) microscopy and fatty acid chemistry (Vicente et al., 1991) enabled us to clarify the taxonomic status of the common loggerhead sponge, Spheciospongia vesparium Lamarck, and its closest relatives. After studying live specimens in their environment on shallow sandy bottoms near Carrie Bow Cay, we placed the related species, the staghorn sponge S. cuspidifera Lamarck, into a separate, newly established genus, Cervicornia (R\u00fctzler and Hooper, 2000) . Using fluorescent dyes, we found that Cervicornia cuspidifera possesses not only a specialized inhalant, ectosomal tissue complex-the staghorn-like structures protruding from the substrate surface and the only parts of the sponge obtained and described by previous collectors-but also an amorphous choanosomal base buried in sand with which it consolidates and excavates sand and rubble fragments, as well as discharges exhalant water (R\u00fctzler, 1997) . Multidisciplinary work made it possible to treat a number of sponge families comprehensively, particularly those from mangroves of the outer shelf. In our extensive collections of Chalinidae from the channels and ponds of Twin Cays, for example, we found and described in detail eight species in the genus Haliclona, three of them new (de Weerdt et al., 1991) . Another species earlier considered new, H. pseudomolitba de Weerdt, R\u00fctzler, and Smith, turned out to be an unusual form of Chalinula molitba de Laubenfels (de Weerdt, 2000) . The composition of this chalinid fauna differs markedly from that in many other Caribbean mangrove habitats and is closer to the fauna of Florida Keys mangroves, perhaps because of the absence of nearby landmasses (and their runoff). Hence, it was concluded that differences in climatic conditions may be of less importance. (Subsequent studies, however, particularly on the Chalinidae of Panama and Venezuela, suggest that apparent differences may have been the result of superficial collecting rather than of ecological causes, as shown in distribution tables by M. C. Diaz and colleagues, so far unpublished but accessible under \"sources\" at http://www.marinespecies.org/porifera.)",

Working with abundant material from Belize and the large collection obtained from the U.S. continental shelf survey along the southeastern and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the early 1980s, we revised and described 21 species under this family, five of them new (Alvarez et al., 1998) . Following subsequent redefinition of related families, five of the species were allocated to the family Dictyonellidae (order Halichondrida). A new genus had to be created for one species, named Pseudaxinella (?) zeai Alvarez, van Soest, and R\u00fctzler to honour our Colombian friend and colleague Sven Zea (Alvarez et al., 1998) . Since in our field notes it was already named Svenzea, Sven ended up with his name attached to both genus and species, Svenzea zeai Alvarez, van Soest, and R\u00fctzler (Alvarez et al., 2002) , probably a first in nomenclature but well deserved. Along with students and other collaborators, Sven was an active programme participant. Their important contribution to systematic studies included a revision of the Cliona caribbaea Carter complex, a much-discussed group of excavating sponges characterized by simple spiculation of tylostyles, delicate spirasters, and brown to blackish colour (due to symbiotic zooxanthellae). The group was found to consist of three species-C. aprica Pang, C. caribbaea, and C. tenuis Zea and Weil-the latter described as new, which can be distinguished in the field by their shades of the basic brown colour, growth form (papillate, thinly or thickly encrusting), and spicule details (Zea and Weil, 2003) . Another study focused on the genus Agelas, which includes many conspicuous and colourful reef sponges and, using classical taxonomic characteristics, defined 13 Caribbean-wide species (Parra-Velandia et al., 2012) .",

                "text": "When our Brazilian colleague Guilherme Muricy of the Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, studied some of our collections at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, he found a lithistid sponge species, genus Gastrophanella (Siphonidiidae) collected in Belize, to be remarkably similar to one he discovered in a cave in Fernando de Naronha, northeast Brazil. Our material came from caves as well, from a flooded Karst cavern near Columbus Cay (25 km north of Carrie Bow Cay), and from the Blue Hole inside Lighthouse Reef atoll made famous by a Jacques Cousteau television documentary. The species was subsequently described as Gastrophanella cavernicola (Muricy and Minervino, 2000) . A particularly surprising discovery was that the starfish Oreaster reticulatus Linnaeus could distinguish between different sponge species where we experts had failed. This common Caribbean starfish is very abundant in and near the mangroves of Twin Cays and was often seen consuming sponges attached to red-mangrove stilt roots or growing among turtlegrass. One of its prey, observed by collaborator Janie Wulff of Florida State University, was the Caribbean fire sponge T. ignis (Poecilosclerida), which is ubiquitous in these habitats, although not all individuals were being eaten. Those not consumed actually belong to a second sympatric species in the same genus-named Tedania klausi Wulffas established from morphological and ecological characteristics as well as molecular traits (Wulff, 2006a) . Another new species named after the present author-hereby gratefully acknowledged-is Aka ruetzleri Calcinai, Cerrano, and Bavestrello (Phloeodictyidae, Haplosclerida), an excavating sponge found during a visit of an Italian team who also clarified differences in micro-and macrostructure of limestone erosion patterns caused by members of this interesting genus (Calcinai et al., 2007) . Collaborators from Spain discovered an unusual growth form of the common Iotrochota birotulata Higgin (Poecilosclerida), which prompted further collecting and reexamination of similar material from the U.S. continental shelf survey mentioned earlier. Our revision confirmed that we had discovered an undescribed species, I. arenosa R\u00fctzler, Maldonado, Piantoni, and Riesgo, and clarified the taxonomic status of three other Iotrochota, bringing the total for the region to four species (R\u00fctzler et al., 2007b) .",

Its many shapes and colour variants-from purple to pale blue, turquoise, green, and yellow to almost white-can create some confusion, as does the presence of two sizes of microscleres in some specimens and only one size in others. The common species in this environment had always been thought to be L. isodictyalis Carter, but its type material, collected from mangroves in Venezuela (now filled in and paved over) and stored in Britain, appeared to have been lost during World War II, making it difficult to ascertain what species we were dealing with. Through a lucky coincidence in the course of our inquiry, Carter's types from that period turned up at the National Museum Liverpool and were generously made available by curator Ian Wallace. Now able to review all species in the region, including unidentified material from the U.S. continental shelf survey, we redefined some and established and described three new ones (R\u00fctzler et al., 2007c) .",

Subsequently, in collaboration with colleagues from the coast of Catalonia, Spain, we made a few pioneering attempts to solve taxonomic and phylogenetic problems with molecular techniques (Erpenbeck et al., 2007) . One of the sponges selected for this work was Chondrilla cf. nucula Schmidt-a Mediterranean species lacking clear distinguishing features and having its name applied to specimens from the tropical and subtropical western Atlantic. We decided to study this species from the mangroves and reefs in Florida, Belize, and Panama because of its apparent morphological modifications in different habitats. As indicated by mtDNA sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, haplotypes in specimens from mangroves and reefs differed enough to suggest a high level of reproductive isolation between the two populations (Duran and R\u00fctzler, 2006) . This finding prompted careful morphological reexamination and ecological experimentation, which revealed previously overlooked characteristics, justified the description of a new species (Chondrilla caribensis R\u00fctzler, Duran, and Piantoni) and two forms (formae caribensis and hermatypica), and explained mechanisms for the speciation suggested by molecular data (R\u00fctzler et al., 2007a) . Although habitat quality obviously has considerable effect on the distribution and morphology of sponges, genetic study confirms that, even within a small region, populations of a species can become ecologically separated long enough to develop genetic differences.",

Thus far it appears that recruitment and community development rates of the various sessile invertebrates monitored, including sponges, decrease along the gradient from temperate to tropical habitats and are lowest in Belize. No evidence has yet been found that longer availability of space could facilitate invasion of non-native species, possibly because of the high diversity and competitive abilities of sessile fauna and resident predators. On the other hand, it could be argued that invasive species are difficult to identify in a region where many native taxa are still undescribed or little known. At least for sponges, it remains difficult to distinguish between new discoveries and new arrivals.",

Some of our programme participants looked for diversity in sponge larvae in routine plankton tows but found none. Snorkelling through mangrove channels during calm periods, we have noted conspicuous red larvae (later identified to be from Tedania) swimming in a spiral motion while remaining very close to the mangrove stilt roots and other substrates, such as peat banks. Because conventional plankton tows had to take place at a safe distance from the coral framework or mangrove roots, we tried pushing or pulling nets by hand while snorkelling or diving, keeping as close as possible to the substrate contour. Although we caught a variety of sponge, coral, and gorgonian larvae (the principal benthos of the reef), it took considerable time and effort to catch enough material with this technique. We then designed a stationary sampler made of an acrylic cylinder containing an electric outboard motor with a propeller and a standard plankton net and flow-metre attached (R\u00fctzler et al., 1980) . Mounted in a rigid frame and weighed down by a battery pack, it could be positioned anywhere on the sea bottom and could propel water through the net at a given speed and volume, usually overnight. The resulting catch allowed us to study larval behaviour, metamorphosis, fine-structure morphology, histochemistry, and generational transmission of symbiotic microbes (Fig. 3.7) .",

This species reproduces almost year-round, and larvae can be obtained in large numbers by incubating a sponge with mature embryos in its tissue in the laboratory's seawater system. Applying histochemical methods, we found serotonin-like immunoreactivity, particularly in archaeocytes of the parenchymella larvae and settled juvenile sponges (Weyrer et al., 1999) . The discovery of a neuroactive substance in sponges, the only free-living invertebrates lacking a demonstrable nervous system, may bring new insights into the origin and evolution of nerve cells in metazoans. The results of another project mentioned earlier (R\u00fctzler et al., 2003) , which compared cytology, microbial symbionts, ciliary patterns, and larval shape and behaviour between Svenzea and Scopalina, supported our decision from morphology alone to place Svenzea in the family Dictyonellidae. Fine-structure (TEM) study also revealed that the microbes in Svenzea, which hosts a diverse population of symbiotic cyanobacteria and bacteria, become transferred to the next generation via the eggs and larvae. This process was confirmed by an independent genetic study (Lee et al., 2009) and also by our finding from TEM morphological comparison that the symbionts are very different and therefore not derived from microbe populations of the surrounding water column.",

To this end, we first established a transect starting in the lagoon just northwest of the island and running eastward and perpendicularly across the barrier reef. The lagoon bottom here consists of sand, rubble, some seagrass (turtlegrass, Thalassia), and patch reefs here and there composed primarily of massive coral heads (Montastraea, Diploria). Only excavating and small rock-and rubble-encrusting sponges are able to survive in this shallow, agitated zone. The same is true in the shallow backreef, reef crest, and inner forereef in depths of up to at least 3 m. As the obvious and fully exposed organisms captured our initial attention, it was not until much later that we found a diverse population of very thin, colourful sponge crusts and cushions on the undersides of heavy, platy coral rubble and boulders resembling material produced by the elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata Lamarck. Because they are not easily overturned and have large areas of the underside not buried in sediment, these platy slabs provide a shaded habitat exposed to strong water flow but protected from fish grazing. We found another interesting habitat inside conch shells (Strombus gigas L.) discarded by fishermen after they extracted the animal by chopping off the shell's apex with a machete to gain access to the adductor muscle. This creates a second opening in the shell, opposite the aperture, and thus provides sponges with adequate water flow.",

The \"blue hole\" lies due northwest of Columbus Cay, which is located on the lagoon side of the barrier-reef platform, about 24 km north of Carrie Bow. It is a sinkhole leading into a drowned Karst cavern, comparable to the famous Blue Hole in the Lighthouse Reef atoll lagoon off Belize City. The cavern is partly filled with sand, and its entrance is a ragged crack in the seafloor some distance above the sand. The water near the entrance is quite murky, and only a few hardy stony corals and octocorals and sponges typical for lagoon seagrass bottoms occur there (particularly, Aplysina fulva (Pallas), Amphimedon compressa Duchassaing and Michelotti, I. birotulata, and Ircinia strobilina Lamarck). Inside the large domed cave, stalactite-like structures protrude from the entire ceiling. These club-like projections turned out to be cemented serpulid (polychaete) worm tubes, which we named pseudostalactites. We were only able to examine steps in the gently curved ceiling because any vertical walls reaching the floor were too deep and far from the entrance to be reached in single-tank scuba gear. The cave floor consists of a huge sediment cone, up to 30 m deep under the cave entrance and unsuitable for sessile benthic organisms such as sponges. Along the dome ceiling, sponges do not occur beyond 20 m from the entrance. With the lack of water exchange and food supply except during very strong storm surges, as well as the dark conditions, the sponge fauna differs significantly from that of the lagoon bottom outside but includes species common in shaded substrates elsewhere on the fore-and backreef, such as framework crevices and lower surfaces of coral boulders and rubble. Some examples are Geodia gibberosa Lamarck, Placospongia carinata, Bowerbank, Spirastrella coccinea Duchassaing and Michelotti, and C. caribensis (as C. nucula), and two lithistids typical of deep water or dark caves, Desmanthus incrustans Topsent, and the aforementioned new species G. cavernicola (first identified as G. implexa Schmidt).

At that point, only a few of our investigators were prepared to make the relatively long trip on one of our small boats, but as word spread of the spectacular but delicate biota flourishing in a striking environment of mixed mangrove cays and steep coral ridges surrounding numerous deep ponds and lagoons, all barely touched by humans, a multidisciplinary team came together to survey the area's principal habitats, communities, and geological features . Although this archipelago is situated in the main lagoon inside the barrier reef, it is awash with oceanic water and contains an abundance of coral and rubble. The depth of the ponds (as much as 10 m in places) prevents resuspension of most fine sediments during storms. The abundance of nutrients and low level of turbidity seem to account for the high diversity and biomass of the benthic communities there, the most striking of which are the sponges, ascidians, and seaweeds. Within view of the unparalleled species richness and lush sponge growth along the rims of the ponds, we held a workshop for experts focused on collecting and identifying the species and comparing the fauna of three of the Pelicans Cays-Cat Cay, Fisherman's Cay, and Manatee Cay-with that of the muddy mangrove islands more common elsewhere in the lagoon, Blue Ground Range, and Twin Cays, 10-15 km to the north . Workshop participants, all familiar with Caribbean sponge faunas, were Belinda Alvarez (then at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand), Cristina Diaz (then at the University of California at Santa Cruz), Kate Smith (then at the Smithsonian Institution), Rob van Soest (University of Amsterdam), Janie Wulff, Sven Zea (National University of Colombia), and myself. The team collected specimens from depths of 0-2 m and occasionally 5 m in all locations by snorkelling and free-diving (2-h excursions at each location), first photographing them in situ, if possible, and then back at the Carrie Bow lab. Their abundance was ranked, by consensus, between very common and very rare. Most identifications were based on hand sections and spicule mounts made in the field, supplemented by a few follow-up studies upon return. The total count from these locations combined was a surprising 182 species, but even more astonishing was that for a well-studied region like the Caribbean Sea, only 100 (55%) could readily be identified. The remaining 82 taxa were either undescribed species or varieties (formae) too poorly known to be confidently identified. Many of these are still under study or may become part of future revisions.",

Their quantitative and productivity study of sponges from reefs near the mainland and from similar habitats in oceanic conditions further offshore revealed that the Caribbean barrier reef supports on average up to six times more sponge biomass per unit area than its Pacific counterpart and that up to 15 times more organic carbon per unit area is consumed through filter feeding.

One is the coastal or river mangrove, generally found in estuarine environments with a salinity gradient ranging from near oceanic to freshwater. Only a few well-protected marine invertebrates such as oysters and sedentary (tube-forming) polychaetes survive being exposed to brackish water and heavy silting from land runoff; sponges are not among them. The other type is the island mangrove, which is surrounded and flushed by more or less oceanic-quality water, and ranges from small tree clusters to large swamp islands. In Belize, these mangrove islands, the larger ones locally known as ranges, occur primarily on the barrier-reef platform along the outer perimeter of the lagoon Feller, 1988, 1996) . Species richness of the root-fouling community increases with distance from the mainland (Ellison and Farnsworth, 1992) . Although salinity gradients can be strong in island mangroves too, tidal flushing with sea water of normal salinity is adequate to allow almost reeflike flora and fauna to thrive there.

The relative importance of species groups is unclear, however, and can change over time (Farnsworth and Ellison, 1996) . Still, some consistency is evident, despite differences in non-biotic factors and geographical distance between sites. In a comparative study of two adjacent locations, Sponge Haven and Hidden Creek at Twin Cays, and a third site near Bocas del Toro, Panama, 1200 km distant, for example, identical quantitative survey methods applied over 3 years indicated that nine sponge species made up 73-89% of the total sponge volume on censused roots at those locations (Wulff, 2009) . Community changes over time, reflected by shifts in number or volume of sponge individuals, may therefore be misunderstood without some consideration of a species' life history characteristics and responses to environmental properties.",

Mature larvae take 5-10 days to settle after a layer of (bacteria-generated) biofilm is established. Second, larvae of some common sponges, such as Sycon sp., T. ignis, Mycale magniraphidifera van Soest, Haliclona tubifera George and Wilson, and Spongia tubulifera Lamarck, are released during all seasons, but recruitment slows down during the coldest winter months (25 C average, 16 C low). Of the settling plates, the dark, sediment-free substrates (lower surfaces of black, horizontal plates) were 15 times more likely to be chosen for settlement than semishaded vertical surfaces. Fully illuminated surfaces, whether exposed to sediment or not, were not settled by sponges at all. In laboratory experiments, upon release and after a dark period (night), larvae first headed towards light but became negative phototactic after hours in light and before settlement. They were also more likely to settle near adult sponges than disperse to new areas despite good swimming ability. This behaviour is enhanced by prevailing current patterns.",

Colonization on shaded substrates is slower, probably because there are fewer photosynthetic organisms there. In this case, the pioneering microbes are followed by coralline algae, foraminiferans, sponges, sessile polychaetes, bryozoans, and ascidians. Once established, encrusting sponges may spread rapidly (about 10 linear mm per month) and cover a test plate completely after 7 months. Growth may be temporarily delayed, halted, or reversed by competition for space with other sponges (and other organisms), by predators, or by invasion of endofauna such as polychaetes and crustaceans.

New substrates, such as test panels, may also be readily invaded by adult sponges growing nearby, which may span distances of tens of centimetres by means of tissue bridges.

Furthermore, diversity and community structure of the sessile benthos, if carefully assessed, may be used as indicators of degrading environmental conditions. In the relatively pristine mangroves of Belize, the effect of above-average sediment load or change in temperature or salinity, in particular, is readily apparent in shifts in the sponge community. On a Caribbean-wide level, however, the composition of the mangrove-sponge fauna is quite unpredictable, so it is impossible to generalize local observations. Water depth and tidal range control the availability of solid substrates, which, for the most part, consist of Rhizophora prop roots and peat banks lining the shores and tidal channels. The water depth in the study area ranges from 0 to 3 m, and the bottom consists of mud and detritus. A few sponge species here (e.g. Haliclona magnifica de Weerdt, R\u00fctzler, and Smith) have lost their substrate support and have adapted to living buried in mud, with only elongate oscular chimneys protruding from the surface. The upper limit of suitable substrate is controlled by the tide range, which is small on average (15 cm mean) but may ebb to 40 cm and more during spring tides and other oceanographic events. The tidal signature influences the zonation of sponges, depending on their resistance to desiccation, possibly through a mechanism of cellular osmoregulation (R\u00fctzler, 1995) . In the study area, three species can tolerate more than 2 h of exposure to air, the hardiest being Haliclona implexiformis Hechtel, followed by Lissodendoryx isodictyalis and Scopalina ruetzleri (Wiedenmayer). These species were able to withstand tissue-water loss of 66%, 54%, and 38% after 6 h, as well as increases in the practical salinity of pore water ranging from the ambient 35 to 51 and 59. Even the hardiest members of the polychaete and crustacean endofauna had died or left their hosts at this point.",

Water warming and enhanced ultraviolet radiation, as occur during a hurricanealong with increased light intensity and sedimentation-can have a devastating impact on shallow reef corals by inducing bleaching, stress, and eventually death (Shick et al., 1996) . In the short term, sponges seem less affected. Indeed, we were unable to induce bleaching in experimental setups using species with zooxanthellae (Cliona varians (Duchassaing and Michelotti)) as well as zoocyanellae (C. caribensis R\u00fctzler, Duran, and Piantoni).

These interactions were the focus of many projects in the Carrie Bow region.

Ultimately, the fastest-growing species prevail and communitywide diversity is maintained only because substrate is not continuous but consists mainly of separate roots (Wulff, 2005) . In comparing sponge diversity on mangrove roots between Twin Cays and the Pelican Cays, we found the latter to be about 2.5 times richer in species than the former Wulff, 2000) .

She transferred genetically identical replicates (cut and healed pieces from one specimen) of six common and typical mangrove sponges from Twin Cays (including the prominent T. ignis and L. isodictyalis) to the Pelicans and six typical reef sponges taken from roots in the Pelicans (e.g. I. birotulata, A. fulva) to Twin Cays. She also provided caging to protect the samples from predation (with uncaged controls) and new PVC tubing to offer competitorfree space. The unprotected Twin Cays mangrove sponges at the Pelicans were almost immediately consumed by fishes, most notably the grey angelfish (Pomacanthus arcuatus L.), whereas caged specimens grew well as long as they were mechanically protected. Reefs are close to or part of the Pelicans and provide niches or hiding places for most spongivore fishes or invertebrates (such as the starfish O. reticulata), which determine species composition and diversity (Wulff 2000 (Wulff , 2005 . Pelican Cays reef species did poorly at Twin Cays, some already deteriorating in transit. Although the remaining ones readily attached to roots and PVC pipes, most shrank in volume, as they did following death or partial death, and were covered by fast-growing neighbouring mangrove sponges, such as T. ignis, Halichondria magniconulosa Hechtel, and Biemna caribea Pulitzer-Finali.",

                "text": "Aside from predation, which is not necessarily terminal, sponges can be damaged by storms, disease, or other physical disturbances. Yet because they are cellular animals without highly specialized tissues, many recover well, by healing wounds and regenerating lost body parts. In fact, when we cut collected specimens into convenient pieces and reattached them to substrates of our choice, they healed within days unless traumatized by exposure to air or extreme temperatures. Janie Wulff, who frequently uses this method, applied it to study energetic costs of wound regeneration in an ecological context, focusing on mangrove roots with high population density and strong competition for space (Wulff, 2010) . To this end, she wounded representatives of a number of species of different growth forms, some closely related, others not, and investigated how long it took for wounds to heal, how responses compared in species with close evolutionary history (congeners) or with similar growth forms or anatomy, and how regeneration affects processes such as growth, reproduction, and space competition. She found that wounds heal within a few days, but that the rate or mode of regeneration, of filling in missing tissue, could not be predicted from properties such as genetic similarity or rates of normal growth. Species with a rapid life cycle and known to be strong competitors (e.g. B. caribea, Haliclona curacaoensis van Soest, H. manglaris Alcolado) are the least likely to quickly cover substrate space made available to competitors in the course of wounding. By contrast, species with a low recruitment rate (e. g. T. ignis, Spongia obscura Hyatt, H. implexiformis) fill in an exposed substrate patch quickly and hold on to it well. In species targeted by one of the rare mangrove-sponge predators (e.g. Halichondria magniconulosa and H. curacaoensis, preyed on by spotted trunk fish, Lactophrys bicaudalis (L.)), wounds from chunks bitten off are more rapidly filled in by tissue than in species not commonly attacked. In seagrass meadows, sponge diversity and abundance have been shown to increase through collaboration between a reef species (Lissodendoryx colombiensis Zea and van Soest) and typical seagrass species (Clathria schoenus de Laubenfels, C. caribensis, Amphimedon erina de Laubenfels [\u00bcA. viridis Duchassaing and Michelotti ?], and T. klausi) (Wulff, 2008) . These turtlegrass associates overgrow L. colombiensis, thus acquiring stable substrate in a sandy habitat and in turn protecting it from predatory feeding by the starfish O. reticulatus. As an added benefit, Lissodendoryx itself has efficient recruitment abilities and rapid regeneration and growth rates. (Fig. 3.10 ) Many sponges in Belizean shallow-water habitats host inter-and intracellular photosynthetic symbionts, microbes, and algae, which have a large impact on the ecological balance of nutrient-deprived reefs and mangroves (R\u00fctzler, 1990) . The majority of large reef sponges harbour the rather small (up to 2 mm) \"Aphanocapsa feldmanni\"-type cyanobacteria, some identified through 16S rRNA sequences as Synechococcus spongiarum (Steindler et al., 2005) . These sponges include members of the genera Geodia (Astrophorida), Chondrilla (Chondrosida), Neofibularia (Poecilosclerida), Xestospongia (Haplosclerida), Ircinia (Dictyoceratida), Aplysina (Verongida), and more. Much rarer is the considerably larger \"A. raspaigellae\"-type cyanobacteria, found in two newly described species of mainly encrusting Dictyonella (Halichondrida) (R\u00fctzler, 1981; as Ulosa) . A filamentous, \"Oscillatoria/ Phormidium spongeliae\"-type cyanobacterium occurs in high density in Hyrtios violaceus Duchassaing and Michelotti (formerly known as Oligoceras), a common occupant of seagrass meadows in shallow lagoon waters. The same, or a very closely related symbiont, was recently discovered (first in Caribbean Panama) in two new species of the haplosclerid sponges Haliclona walentinae Diaz, Thacker, R\u00fctzler, and Piantoni and Xestospongia bocatorensis Diaz, Thacker, R\u00fctzler, and Piantoni (Diaz et al., 2007; Thacker et al., 2007) , both described from shallow reef and mangrove habitats. We measured photosynthesis and respiration of the three compound species above and compared them with sponges symbiotic with high numbers of unicellular cyanobacteria (high content of chlorophyll a), namely, C. nucula, Neopetrosia subtriangularis Duchassaing, and A. fulva (Thacker et al., 2007; K. R\u00fctzler, unpublished) . Despite great variability, we calculated P:R ratios of 1.5 or more, showing that all qualify as phototrophic species. Nevertheless, even if a few more phototrophic sponges were added to the list, the population is much smaller than that in the oligotrophic zones of Australia's GBR, where 50% of the sponge biomass consists of small phototrophic species (Wilkinson, 1987; Wilkinson and Cheshire, 1990) .",

                "text": "A few of our colleagues tested whether the production of dissolved organic nitrogen (DIN) through nitrification in some of the common symbiotic sponges might influence the nutrient cycle on the reef and in the mangrove. One study concentrated on three common species known to harbour cyanobacteria in high concentrations: S. zeai (as ?Pseudaxinella) from ca. 20 m depth on the forereef, C. caribensis (as C. nucula) from mangrove roots at Twin Cays, and H. violaceus (as Oligoceras violacea) from 2-3 m in turtlegrass in the lagoon; a fourth species devoid of cyanobacterial symbionts, the reef sponge Plakortis halichondrioides Wilson, served as a control (Diaz and Ward, 1997) . In the DIN flux experiments, spongemediated nitrification proved to be an important process in these habitats, and species associated with cyanobacteria showed the highest production rates per weight of oxidized nitrogen reported from any benthic community. P. halichondrioides showed some nitrification activity as well, but to a much lower degree than in the species containing cyanobacteria; it is safe to assume that this nitrification is related to other types of endobiotic bacteria. Another study used molecular methods to detect ammonium-oxidizing bacteria of Nitrosomonas spp. lineage in common sponges from the Twin Cays mangrove (Diaz et al., 2002 (Diaz et al., , 2004b . Microbes of this nature were found in five of six widely distributed sponges: H. implexiformis (Haplosclerida), L. isodictyalis, T. ignis (Poecilosclerida), Geodia papyracea Hechtel (Astrophorida), and C. caribensis (as C. nucula) (Chondrosida). Apparently their occurrence is independent of symbiotic cyanobacteria (regularly present only in the latter two species). Only an undetermined species of Spongia (Dictyoceratida) gave negative results, possibly because of procedural problems in the experiments.",

Since it has already been established that the rootfouling community of sponges and ascidians protects mangroves from exposure to wood-boring isopods (Ellison and Farnsworth, 1990) , some have questioned whether the trees might also receive a nutritional benefit from this association in an oligotrophic environment. Accordingly, specimens of the very common T. ignis (Poecilosclerida) and H. implexiformis (Haplosclerida) at Twin Cays were transplanted from populated to new, bare roots and nitrogen and carbon levels measured in these sponges (as well as in S. (as Ulosa) ruetzleri (Halichondrida) and in parts (rootlets, roots, twigs, leaves) of the new host tree (Ellison et al., 1996) . Wherever sponges were attached, prop-root growth increased significantly, and hair rootlets that permeate mangal epiphytes developed. The latter were comparable to those spreading into the substrate mud where new roots reach the bottom. Furthermore, when attached to the roots, the transplanted sponges grew faster than the controls fastened to plastic pipes. Stable isotope analyses indicated both flow of inorganic nitrogen from sponges to tree and treeproduced carbon into the fouling sponges, thus signalling a facultative mutualistic relationship between trees and sponges. This is a surprising outcome, further supported by controls with the similarly fouling red alga, Acanthophora spicifera Vahl, which did not seem to repay stilt roots for the use of their space as a substrate.",

On the basis of morphological characteristics, established in part by transmission electron micrography, we distinguished two species of the dinophycean algae Gymnodinium. One, G. microadriaticum Freudenthal, occurs in the C. caribbaea complex, brown, papillate, or encrusting sponges, which, according to Zea and Weil (2003) , actually include three species: C. aprica, C. caribbaea, and C. tenuis. Gymnodinium is also found in the inhalant fistules of the endopsammic C. cuspidifera (Vicente et al., 1991, as Spheciospongia; R\u00fctzler and Hooper, 2000) . This zooxanthella appears to be the same as that associated with protozoans, cnidarians (including the reef corals), and mollusks. The other alga, Gymnodinium sp., was found only in C. varians (formerly Anthosigmella). Its symbiotic stage differs from that of G. microadriaticum in size (being about half the diameter) and in some fine-structural details of the nucleus and chloroplast (R\u00fctzler, 1990) . Identification will remain uncertain, however, until free-living and reproductive stages can be obtained (Anastazia Banaszak, personal communication). Although there is no reason as yet to doubt that symbioses with zooxanthellae are species-specific, recent molecular evidence suggests that infraspecific relations might be less rigid. Experiments conducted in the Florida Keys have shown that recolonization of partly bleached (aposymbiotic) C. varians by zooxanthellae does not necessarily involve the original algal strain left in undisturbed tissue areas of the same specimen (Hill and Wilcox, 1998) . In this case, the repopulating algae were more related to a strain found in a sea anemone (Aiptasia pallida) that was attached near the experimental site than to that living in unbleached areas of the same sponge. Unfortunately, the study did not include fine-structure-morphological imaging that could be compared to our observations.",

                "text": "In 1998, an extended period of anomalously high seawater temperatures caused widespread coral bleaching on reefs in Belize and throughout the world (Aronson et al., 2000) . Under the temperature stress, host corals expelled their zooxanthellae and became bleached. To determine whether sponges might be affected in a similar way, we subjected specimens of C. caribbaea (which contains zooxanthellae) and C. caribensis (which contains zoocyanellae) to harsh temperatures. Placed tied down onto floating wooden frames with a stainless-steel mesh bottom, the sponges were kept fully exposed to sunlight but were cooled and fed by ambient water. Bleaching failed to occur, however, and the specimens died after 10-16 days of exposure. Elsewhere-both in the Florida Keys, as mentioned earlier (Hill and Wilcox, 1998) , and in Puerto Rico-some bleaching has been reported, in the latter case involving the species C. varians (with zooxanthellae) and Xestospongia muta and Petrosia pellasarca de Laubenfels (Haplosclerida; with zoocyanellae) (Vicente, 1990) . But unlike corals in the same habitats, sponges appear to experience rather localized bleaching, with only a few individuals of the population being affected. In Belize we saw or were informed about partly or fully \"bleached\" X. muta, but in each case the affected specimens were dead or dying, and the dead parts were held together only temporarily by their skeletons. The causes of these occasional die-offs are unknown but seem unrelated to recorded temperature highs.",

                "text": "Other sponge-endobiotic plants include algae that permeate or replace proper spongin skeletons. Two types of algae-the chlorophyte Ostreobium cf. constrictum and the rhodophyte Acrochaetium spongicolum-are found in the poecilosclerid sponge Mycale laxissima, a dark reddish to brown tubular species growing on shallow patch reefs and in well-flushed mangrove channels near Carrie Bow (R\u00fctzler, 1990) . The sponge is supported by a rigid network of thick (0.3-3 mm) fibres that are cored by staggered bundles of large subtylostyloid spicules. Intertwined filaments of these algae are present along the spicules, boring and permeating the layered spongin of the fibres, and giving the otherwise clear fibres a strong greenish or reddish tint. No data are available on the possible benefit to either partner in this association, and it is unclear how the algae can obtain enough light for survival in such a dense, dark-coloured sponge. From ground and polished sections of samples embedded in epoxy resin, it appears that the strands of overlapping, glassy spicules could function much like a fibre-optics light conduit, as soon confirmed by the report of a similar phenomenon in an Antarctic sponge (Cattaneo-Vietti et al., 1996) . In some instances, relationships with higher algae are even closer, with the branching, calcified plants replacing the spongin skeleton of the sponges entirely. A common example in the tropical western Atlantic is the calcified rhodophyte alga Jania adherens Lamouroux which has become part of the dictyoceratid sponge Dysidea janiae Duchassaing and Michelotti and J. capillacea Harvey substituting for the skeleton of the poecilosclerid Strongylacidon griseum Schmidt. In both compound species, it is notable that the algae conform the shape of the sponges, occasionally protruding during a growth spurt, but then remaining confined within the exopinacoderm of the host. Similarly, the Indo-Pacific haplosclerid sponge Haliclona cymaeformis (Esper) has incorporated the red alga Ceratodictyon spongiosum Zanardini, which is thought to benefit directly from dissolved inorganic nitrogen (ammonia) excreted by the host sponge (Davy et al., 2002) .",

When Barry Spracklin, one of CCRE's earliest volunteer station managers and also a student of hydroid biology, investigated reef habitats off Carrie Bow, he found that of the 45 species collected only one, Halecium bermudense Congdon, which is dominant on the forereef and patch reefs, was regularly associated with sponges (Spracklin, 1982) . An undescribed corynid hydroid, believed to belong to a new genus, also grew on the surface of some sponges: in the reef-crest zone, it was found on the excavating species C. caribbaea Carter, and in the spur-and-groove area of the forereef, it was on Monanchora barbadensis Hechtel (now accepted as Monanchora arbuscula (Duchassaing and Michelotti)). In a survey of hydroid distribution at Twin Cays and of their species composition, zonation, substrates, and quantitative abundance by our Canadian colleague Dale Calder (Calder, 1991a,b,c) , 9 out of 49 species were found growing on sponges, including one described as new, Turritopsoides brehmeri Calder (1988) , and one previously known only from the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean, which turned up in the Twin Cays main channel on the toxic T. ignis. Most other interactions between hydroids and sponges were found to be of a competitive nature, with sponges, algae, and ascidians outcompeting the cnidarians on subtidal redmangrove prop roots by overgrowing and smothering them.",

                "text": "Many reef sponges have a very close association with one of a half dozen species of the epizoic zoanthid Parazoanthus, some drab, others quite colourful, such as bright yellow or red and often a colour contrasting with that of the host (Fig. 3.11A ). These zoanthids seem to be attracted to a select group of sponges, although not all individuals of a population may be affected. Sara Lewis, a graduate student at the time, studied the roles of the two partners of the association (Lewis, 1982) , focusing on the sponges Callyspongia vaginalis (Lamarck) and Niphates digitalis (Lamarck) because they are common on the reef and a high percentage of specimens support the zoanthid Parazoanthus parasiticus (Duchassaing and Michelotti). Both sponges have tubular to vasiform bodies with single distal atrial openings, which makes it convenient to monitor the animals' metabolic activity levels with an unobtrusive thermistor-based flow-metre (Forstner and R\u00fctzler, 1969) . Field observations and experiments showed that the frequency of zoanthid colonization is higher on larger, older sponges, and that, contrary to the original hypothesis, fish predation potential is not lowered, at least not by the fairly inconspicuous zoanthids studied. Also, flow measurements showed that Parazoanthus-populated specimens have a reduced variance of pumping rates, indicating an increased metabolic expenditure of the host. As the zoanthids clearly benefit from gaining competitor-free living space, in the particular species combinations investigated, the functional interactions tend to be of a more parasitic than mutualistic nature. However, the mutualism model may still apply to sponges associated with more brilliantly coloured zoanthids that may slow or prevent predation by fishes. (Fig. 3.11 ) Much attention has been paid to sponges as habitats occupied by various specialists undeterred by repellent metabolites. These include a host of polychaetes, such as syllids-one even named for its habitat, Haplosyllis spongicola (Grube), another, Syllis mayeri, described as a new species from Carrie Bow where it was found in the sponge I. strobilina (Musco and Giangrande, 2005) . Then there are various copepods, decapods (shrimps, crabs), amphipods, brittle stars, and a few fishes (blennies, eels). Many of these tenants do not hesitate to take a few bites out of the host tissue now and again. On the other hand, some turn out to be quite useful in fending off predators or clearing fine sediments off a surface containing incurrent pores.",

The sponge was collected from a reef off Carrie Bow, almost in view of the field station's kitchen and the crustacean named after one of our excellent cooks, Regina, who always kept an eye on nearby divers while she prepared the next meal. The copepod's feeding habits and damage, if any, to the host remain unclear. However, studies of live specimens and electron micrographs have shed considerable light on other tenants, such as the amphipod (Anamixis hanseni Stebbing) found inside some calcareous sponge (as well as in ascidians). Long suspected of piercing and sucking host tissue, it was shown to be commensal in its feeding habit after close examination of the crustacean's modified and reduced mouth parts (Thomas and Taylor, 1981) . While inside their hosts, the animals were found to trap small organic particles on a filter formed by tufts of setae on their gnathopods. Upon sampling many more sponges and other potential hosts for commensal amphipod species, our colleagues Jim Thomas and (then) graduate student Kristina Klebba described several new species from Belize, including Leucothoe ashleyae from C. vaginalis, Niphates erecta Duchassaing and Michelotti, Aiolochroia crassa (Hyatt) (listed as Pseudoceratina), and Amphimedon compressa (Duchassaing and Michelotti); L. kensleyi, named after Smithsonian carcinologist and longtime CCRE staff member Brian Kensley, from C. vaginalis (Thomas and Klebba, 2006) ; L. barana from A, compressa, C. podatypa, I. birotulata, Leucetta imberbis (Duchassaing and Michelotti), N. erecta, S. zeai, and T. ignis; L. garifunae (named for the Garifuna culture, which prevails on the mainland, in Dangriga) from I. birotulata, A. crassa (as Pseudoceratina), and L. imberbis; L. saron from A. crassa (as Pseudoceratina); and L. ubouhu (Garifuna is the term for \"island\") from C. varians, Hyrtios sp., L. isodictyalis, M. laxissima, and Spongia obliqua Duchassaing and Michelotti (as S. officinalis subsp. obliqua) (Thomas and Klebba, 2007) .

One of these, Lysmata pederseni Rhyne and Lin (Lysmatidae), is a common occupant of the tubular C. vaginalis where it often occurs in pairs. In studying the mating behaviour of these shrimps, Antonio Baeza, one of our postdoctoral fellows, found that they are monogamous hermaphrodites and that the pairs consist of either two hermaphrodites or one hermaphrodite and one male (Baeza, 2010) . The hermaphrodites are biased towards the development of female reproductive structures, and the pairs seem to mate with each other exclusively for a long period of time. The monogamous mating behaviour appears to be highly beneficial on a reef, a structured habitat with many predators, where suitable shelters, such as this host sponge, are relatively rare.",

                "text": "In the late 1980s, (then) Smithsonian postdoctoral fellow Emmett Duffy joined our team to study the ecology, behaviour, and genetics of one of the most diverse groups of sponge \"guests,\" the snapping shrimps (Alpheidae). Every diver is familiar with the loud clicking sound that these animals make with their large claw, which makes them look like a miniature version of the Maine lobster. Upon comparing species of the genus Synalpheus living in the sponges S. vesparium and A. clathrodes from Belize, Panama, and Florida, with and without planktonic larvae, Duffy noted that genetic diversity was much higher in the species with lower dispersal potential and developing directly without swimming larvae (Duffy, 1993) . Subsequent research by Duffy and collaborators led to the discovery and description of a number of new alpheid taxa, among them Synalpheus regalis Duffy (1996a) , so named because only a single female (queen) inhabited the colony. This species lives in sponges exclusively and was found in Xestospongia (now Neopetrosia) subtriangularis Duchassaing and Hyatella intestinalis Lamarck on the outer reef ridge off Carrie Bow Cay. Ten more new alpheid species were described by the team over the next decade (Duffy, 1998; Duffy, 1999, 2007; . Eventually, R\u00edos and Duffy had accumulated enough material to recognize that a new genus may be required to separate most Synalpheus species because of two consistent morphological structures on their pereopods, including a brush of setae (R\u00edos and Duffy, 2007) . The proposed new genus, Zuzalpheus, incorporated the Mayan word zuz (brush) in its name-most appropriate for our research area-but because of taxonomic technicalities, this new taxon was not generally accepted by specialists in the group (E. Duffy, personal communication). At least 16 sponge species from the Belize barrier reef off Carrie Bow Cay serve as hosts for Synalpheus, all in the genera Spheciospongia, Lissodendoryx, Hymeniacidon, Agelas, Niphates, Calyx (as Pachychalina), Oceanapia, Xestospongia, Hyatella, and Aiolochroia (as Pseudoceratina). One of the alpheids was the above-mentioned S. regalis, which became famous as the first marine species known to have eusocial organization, where reproduction is reserved for a few individuals in a colony, whereas most other members help raise and defend the offspring (Duffy, 1996b (Duffy, , 2007 . This social organization had hitherto been known from only a few insects (ants, termites, honeybees) and from African mole-rats. Duffy and his group examined many more sponge-dwelling alpheid species, found eusociality to be widespread, and contributed a wealth of data to research on host specificity of the shrimps, their morphological differentiation, evolution, behaviour, and colony assembly, structure, and defence (Duffy and Macdonald, 1999; Duffy, 2002; Duffy et al., 2000 Duffy et al., , 2002 Morrison et al., 2004; Duffy, 2005, 2008; T\u00f3th and Bauer, 2007) .",

When mentioned in the literature, their species are not always listed (Greenfield and Johnson, 1981) , although C. vaginalis is often named, probably because it is easily identified owing to its tubular shape, convenient for hiding (Hendler, 1984; Gilbert and Tyler, 1997) . One of its associates is the ophiuroid Ophiothrix lineata Lyman, whose feeding behaviour has been studied by Gordon Hendler, formerly at the Smithsonian but now an echinoderm specialist at the Los Angeles County Museum (Hendler, 1984) . Using experiments and cinematography, Hendler found that Ophiothrix not only lives in C. vaginalis but also sweeps up detritus particles stuck to the sponge surface and too large to be drawn through the inhalant pores. This sweeping removes silt that slows the sponge's pumping activity and is also of benefit to the brittle star in providing it shelter. Another sponge shown to be desirable as a hideout for brittle stars is Mycale laevis (Carter): a specimen extracted during a collecting trip to southern Belize contained nearly 250 specimens of an Ophiactis (Hendler and Pawson, 2000) .",

A cover of whitish bacterial filaments (Beggiatoa sp.), a sure sign of decay, is particularly noticeable on some of the beautiful large reef sponges. At times, however, it may be impossible to distinguish between disease agents and tissue decay in a community, as in preserved samples of dead X. muta and Callyspongia plicifera (Lamarck) sent to us at the Smithsonian. A few cases of Aplysina red-band syndrome (ARBS), first reported in 2004 in the Bahamas (Olson et al., 2006) and now considered widespread in the Caribbean, prompted extensive reef surveys off Carrie Bow Cay and monitoring of affected specimens (study in progress by D. G. Gochfeld, J. B. Olsen, C. Piantoni, K. R\u00fctzler, R. W. Thacker, and E. Villamizar, and M. C. Diaz) . ARBS seems to be triggered by a filamentous cyanobacterium, still under study. The saprophagous disease community of bacteria, diatoms, ciliates, polychaetes, and others is dominated by the filamentous red alga Polysiphonia, which produces the characteristic red colour. Another syndrome caused by a filamentous cyanobacterium was observed in N. digitalis. Since cases of diseased sponges remain sporadic at this time, the study will be continued when more material becomes available.",

The government of British Honduras (Belize) had established a sponge-planting industry in Turneffe lagoon in 1926, even though the two most promising species-sheepswool (H. lachne) and velvet (H. gossypina)-were considered to be of low or average quality, respectively (Stuart, 1948) . The main objective was to supply cuttings for concessions granted to private individuals. Despite considerable financial investments, the operation was not very successful, partly because of slow sponge growth and the government's inability to provide enough cuttings. By 1939, the established plantations of about 800,000 sponges (one-third wool, two-thirds velvet sponges) were destroyed by a disease attributed to a filamentous microbial organism, possibly a fungus that had spread from the Bahamas through the Florida Keys and Cuba to Belize (Smith, 1939 (Smith, , 1941 Galtsoff, 1942) . Only about 250 kg of the sponges could be salvaged and sold in 1940. Subsequent test plantings of sheepswool cuttings showed a survival rate of only 2% after 5 years, indicating that the blight was still active in the area. The filamentous disease organism could not be positively identified but was thought to be different from bacteria or fungi that appear in sponges after death from other causes, such as extreme fluctuations in salinity. Although records of environmental conditions at the Turneffe Islands culture sites were scarce in those days, local observers had indeed reported a period of exposure to unusually high salinity, attributed to extremely low tides and rainfall and a spell of very hot weather (Smith, 1941) .",

Of the nine locations examined within the area of the old plantings (by divers with mask, snorkel, and fins towed for 30-90 min behind a boat), only one had a sizable population of velvet sponges in depths of 1-2 m. The finding was impressive enough, however, to suggest the potential for reviving a fishery and to call for further surveys to determine the magnitude of the resource. At one location, along the margin of one of the presumed old farms-the exact position and extent of which are not available from the literature-researchers found several of the characteristic concrete disks used by farmers to anchor cuttings from larger sponges until they regenerated and grew back to harvestable size.",

From a review of the literature on commercial species (of the genera Spongia and Hippospongia) throughout the West Indies, his own observations, and information from local fishermen, Vicente (1989) learned that up to the first half of the twentieth century, these sponges were ubiquitous in shallow water and commercially exploited to some degree throughout the area. After a series of widespread mortalities, most populations disappeared from all habitats in the southern parts of the region, particularly the Greater and Lesser Antilles (Hispaniola, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands), and never returned. On the other hand, the equally affected populations in the northern parts of the region (Gulf of Mexico, Florida, Cuba, Bahamas) eventually recovered and could again be commercially harvested. In Vicente's view, the species in these two genera may have evolved under a somewhat cooler climate than exists at present and may have succumbed or become vulnerable to slight but long-lasting temperature elevation in the southern West Indies.

Although the presence of zooxanthellae in the exposed structures may help the uptake of nutrients, the sponge is a fully functional filter feeder and takes in water through pores in the fistules, filters it through the choanosomal parts of the buried body, and expels it through oscula deep below the sand surface.

Tectitethya is built like a regular sponge, conical to cylindrical, massive, usually with just one large osculum and many ostia partly arranged in groups. This species is deeply embedded and anchored in sand and also regularly covered by sediment.

Five (including Haliclona caerulea Hechtel and T. crypta) made no distinction and took up all size fractions occurring in the surrounding sand bottom (Cerrano et al., 2004) .

We also investigated several ecological and palaeoecological factors, such as rates of excavation and production of fine sediments. We had already shown how sponge cells chemically carve out small but distinctive chips from the substrate (R\u00fctzler and Rieger, 1973) and thus contribute significantly to the microgranular fraction (4-30 mm) of the carbonate sediment. By monitoring chip production and the loss of mass of previously weighed substrate, we obtained data on excavating activity and rates (R\u00fctzler, 1975) .

Surprisingly, we found that penetration into dense substrate is quicker, and also that porous coral species are not necessarily the ones that grow faster (Highsmith, 1981) . These traits may be of adaptive value because the endolithical lifestyle is geared to protection, and many predators, like triggerfish or wrasses, have powerful jaws and can easily consume or expose the borers. These conclusions were confirmed by measurements of growth rates, density, and bioerosion in three common massive corals near the Carrie Bow laboratory (Highsmith et al., 1983) . Sponges were found to be responsible for 85-94% of all excavations, and dense species were more bored than porous ones.",

One example is the brownish to blackish (owing to the presence of zooxanthellae) C. caribbaea, a common shallow-water species on reefs near Carrie Bow. Zea and Weil (2003) believe some members of this population belong to another species, C. tenuis Zea and Weil. Following a series of hurricanes preceded or accompanied by very calm seas and high temperatures, we noticed this sponge overgrowing many corals in shallow water, including very large, old, massive species of Montastraea and Diploria. An experimental study showed that the sponge is both undermining coral calices and growing over the live surfaces of corals that are temperature-stressed and unable to fend off the aggressor (R\u00fctzler, 2002c) . Similar research was conducted by Andia Chaves-Fonnegra, for a dissertation with advisor Sven Zea of the National University of Colombia. The species she concentrates on is C. delitrix and preliminary results confirm the suspicion that it has become a threatening bioeroder of corals. These observations add strength to the idea that many kinds of coral stress (temperature, pollution) may lead to irreversible destruction of the reef framework.",

Several species in this genus excavate live coral boulders by carving and etching out single cavities that can attain 10 cm or more in diameter. Their study showed that secondary metabolites (various forms of siphonodictyal, named A-H) produced a dead zone on the live coral surrounding the inhalant papillae and exhalant oscular chimneys, thus keeping the sponge from being overgrown by the host coral. This confirmed previous field observations (R\u00fctzler, 1971) suggesting that a mucuous secretion from the sponge kept the nearby coral tissue in check through the effect of metabolites in the mucus. The same compound may also aid sponge larvae in the initial penetration, which often appears to take place on the top of live corals. The chemical ecologists noted, too, that the metabolites appear to help transport calcium ions, a byproduct of the excavating process, from the sponge's interior to the surrounding sea water. Two decades later, both results-defence against coral overgrowth and removal of calcium ions produced by bioerosion-were independently confirmed by another team working with material from S. coralliphagum (\u00bcAka coralliphaga) collected in the Bahamas (Bickmeyer et al., 2010) .",

To address this question, colleagues from Florida at the time conducted field experiments comparing Belizean and Florida mangrove and seagrass habitats (Bingham and Young, 1991) . Contrary to the results of laboratory experiments presented in the literature, none of the sponges tested in the field repelled nearby settlement of invertebrate larvae. In fact, some ascidians, sea anemones, and oysters seemed to be somewhat attracted to established sponges. As the authors suggest, the laboratory trials may not have been effective in reproducing conditions in the undisturbed habitat. In studying chemical defences and space competition among sponges on reefs in Guam, Thacker et al. (1998) identified allelopathic terpenoid compounds that indeed were effective in space competition and deterred fish spongivory as well, showing that complex mechanisms are involved and thus require much more field research to delineate the compounds and their effects under natural conditions.",

Studies of ecology and ecophysiology will shed more light on the role of sponges in marine communities-particularly in tropical shallow-water coral reefs-during times of climate change, ocean acidification, and increased pollution from growing human populations. They will also make clearer the kind of aquaculture needed to produce sustainable seafood and bioactive compounds. Many aspects of sponge feeding, species interactions, and space competition are weakly understood, as are their suitability as biomonitors or biological filters that may indicate or deal with certain pollutants, such as trace metals and oil seeps or spills. Technical advances and new allocations of resources will enable science to set new boundaries in the study of poorly known marine communities and ecosystems, such as deep reefs and deep-sea bottoms. New findings and study techniques in the field of microbial symbioses will improve the characterization of microbes, permit their possible culture, and clarify their role in sponge-metabolic processes and disease. There is also much to be learned about the kinds and importance of cyanobacteria and zooxanthellae in sponges, not to mention the fate of hosts and symbionts during temperature stress. Sponge diseases and their causes constitute another important topic in itself. Last but not least, sponge silica cycling in the sea merits close attention, with an emphasis on the relatively new field of sponge-generated biocomposits such as carbonate, silica, chitin, and spongin, and various combinations thereof.",

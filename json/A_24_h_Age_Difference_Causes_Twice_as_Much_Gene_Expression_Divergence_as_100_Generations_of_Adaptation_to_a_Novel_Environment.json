Because many biotic and abiotic factors influence gene expression, it is recommended to control them as tightly as possible. Here, we show that a 24 h age difference of Drosophila simulans females that were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) five and six days after eclosure resulted in more than 2000 differentially expressed genes. This is twice the number of genes that changed expression during 100 generations of evolution in a novel hot laboratory environment. Importantly, most of the genes differing in expression due to age introduce false positives or negatives if an adaptive gene expression analysis is not controlled for age. Our results indicate that tightly controlled experimental conditions, including precise developmental staging, are needed for reliable gene expression analyses, in particular in an evolutionary framework.",

The analysis of gene expression patterns in contrasting environments is a highly promising approach to study phenotypic plasticity on a high-throughput scale [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 10] . While such studies typically focus on a single or a few genotypes, another very popular line of research is the comparison of gene expression patterns among individuals with different genotypes or among different species. Such analyses have been used, for example, for the identification of genetic architectures underlying gene expression regulation [11, 12] . Moreover, even the evolutionary forces operating on gene expression patterns have been studied by comparing populations collected from distant habitats [13] [14] [15] [16] or contrasting evolved and ancestral populations [17] [18] [19] .",

                "text": "Similar to the impact of environmental and genetic variation on gene expression, dynamic changes during development also provide exciting research questions (e.g., expression profiles of the life cycle [20] ). Given the well-documented influence of these factors, it is apparent that they need to be tightly controlled for powerful and unbiased gene expression analyses. Because gene expression analyses of natural populations potentially confound genetic variation, environmental heterogeneity, developmental stage, and possibly even tissue heterogeneities [21] , it is advised to measure gene expression in settings that control most, if not all, of these factors. Hence, organisms that can be studied in the laboratory provide the potential for gene expression analyses that are much better controlled and thus more informative, in particular for small expression differences. It has become common practice to control for environmental heterogeneity by maintenance under well-defined conditions for multiple generations to minimize transgenerational effects. More challenging is the control of developmental stage, as genetic variation can also result in changes in developmental rates [22, 23] . Hence, the analysis of different genotypes during developmental stages with rapid transcriptomic turnover is extremely arduous. An alternative approach to account for this problem focusses on developmental stages which are characterized by low turnover in gene expression levels.",

The common garden experiment was set up after five replicates of the evolved population had adapted for 103 generations to a novel hot laboratory environment fluctuating between 18 and 28 \u2022 C in 12 h dark-12 h light photoperiods at a census population size of 1250 adult individuals per population. Five replicates of the reconstituted ancestral population [34] and 10 replicates (two copies of each independently evolved replicate) of the evolved population were reared with controlled egg density (400 eggs/bottle) at the same temperature regimes as during the experimental evolution (28-18 \u2022 C in 12 h day-12 h night cycling environment). After two generations in a common environment, during which most transgenerational effects were homogenized between the two populations, 50 females from each replicate of ancestral and evolved populations were collected one day after eclosure. The females were kept at a density of 50 individuals per vial and were checked for male contamination. At day 5 after eclosure, the collected females from each of the five replicates of evolved and ancestral populations were frozen. At day 6 after eclosure, we froze another sample for each replicate of the evolved population, which was exactly 24 h older than the first one.

PC1 accounted for 36% of total variance and separated evolved samples with different ages. PC2 distinguished the evolved samples from their ancestors but explained only 22% of the total variance, which was about half of PC1 (Figure 2A ). For a more direct analysis of the principle variables in the experiment, we performed a PVCA [41] and obtained very similar results, with an even larger proportion of the variation being explained by age ( Figure 2B ). The contrasting variance explained by the two factors was also reflected in the number and magnitude of expression changes. Comparing the absolute expression changes caused by 24 h difference in age and 100 generations of evolution across all expressed genes, we found that age difference contributed to significantly larger gene expression changes than evolution (Wilcoxon's rank sum test, p < 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u221216 , Figure S2 ). For a more detailed analysis of the underlying genes, we performed a differential gene expression analysis and identified 2051 genes with significant differences in gene expression between populations differing in age by 24 h (FDR < 0.05 and FC > 1.25, contrast: age). Only 934 genes changed their expression significantly between the ancestral and evolved populations of the same age (FDR < 0.05 and FC > 1.25, contrast: evolution).

GO enrichment analysis revealed that genes with increased expression 6 days after eclosure were involved in multiple developmental or pattern formation processes (Table S2) , including gonad development (GO:0008406), neuroblast development (GO:0014019), and antennal development (GO:0007469). Furthermore, 9 out of 11 transcription factors (TFs) regulating leg disc proximal/distal pattern formation (GO:0007479) as well as 5 out of 6 TFs involved in wing disc proximal/distal pattern formation (GO:0007473) were upregulated. Because these TFs may be the upstream regulators activating many developmental genes, we suspect their involvement in the secondary development of adult flies. For example, during the first week after eclosure, the number of mushroom body fibers increase in adult fly brains [46] , which could be reflected in the GO terms of neuroblast development (GO:0014019), neuroblast fate determination (GO:0007400), neuroblast fate commitment (GO:0014017), mushroom body development (GO:0016319), and brain development (GO:0007420). Processes enriched among downregulated genes affect the cell cycle (e.g., DNA replication, mitosis, meiosis) as well as DNA repair (Table S2) , and many of them have been reported to be downregulated during aging [47] [48] [49] .

GO enrichment analysis revealed that genes with increased expression 6 days after eclosure were involved in multiple developmental or pattern formation processes (Table S2) , including gonad development (GO:0008406), neuroblast development (GO:0014019), and antennal development (GO:0007469). Furthermore, 9 out of 11 transcription factors (TFs) regulating leg disc proximal/distal pattern formation (GO:0007479) as well as 5 out of 6 TFs involved in wing disc proximal/distal pattern formation (GO:0007473) were upregulated. Because these TFs may be the upstream regulators activating many developmental genes, we suspect their involvement in the secondary development of adult flies. For example, during the first week after eclosure, the number of mushroom body fibers increase in adult fly brains [46] , which could be reflected in the GO terms of neuroblast development (GO:0014019), neuroblast fate determination (GO:0007400), neuroblast fate commitment (GO:0014017), mushroom body development (GO:0016319), and brain development (GO:0007420). Processes enriched among downregulated genes affect the cell cycle (e.g., DNA replication, mitosis, meiosis) as well as DNA repair (Table S2) , and many of them have been reported to be downregulated during aging [47] [48] [49] . Despite the fact that the 24 h age difference in our experiment represents only a very small fraction of the typical life of a fly, it is remarkable that many of the observed expression changes were consistent, for both genes and GO enrichment categories, with signatures described for flies aging over substantially larger time spans in a large D. melanogaster cohort (Table 1) [33] .

The processes enriched among the upregulated genes included chorion-containing eggshell formation (GO:0007304), eggshell chorion assembly (GO:0007306), and vitelline membrane formation involved in chorion-containing eggshell formation (GO:0007305) (Table S2 ). These changes probably reflect the documented fecundity increase in the evolved replicates [35] . In addition, several RNA metabolic processes such as nuclear mRNA surveillance (GO:0071028) and nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process (GO:0034427) were enriched among the genes with upregulated expression. This may reflect the importance of mRNA quality control in eukaryotic cells in stressful conditions [50, 51] . The 778 genes downregulated during adaptation were mainly involved in cellular signaling processes such as signal transduction (GO:0007165) and regulation of membrane potential (GO:0042391). The GO terms nervous system process (GO:0050877) and mushroom body development (GO:0016319) also point to adaptation processes related to brain functions. In addition to nervous system, enrichment for several other developmental processes including Malpighian tubule development (GO:0072002) and regulation of striated muscle tissue development (GO:0016202) was also decreased during temperature adaptation. Our results suggest that a general delay in multiple developmental processes seems to be beneficial at high temperatures.",

In this contrast, 1551 genes were differentially expressed, and only 291 of them coincided with the contrast involving flies of the same age ( Figure 3A) . Additionally, 1260 genes were private to the contrast mismatched and are involved in a wide range of processes related to tissue development (e.g., gonad development (GO:0008406), Figure 4A ) and cell cycle-related processes (e.g., DNA replication initiation (GO:0006270), Figure 4B ). Most of these GO categories were also detected in the age contrast (Table S3 ). Out of 1260 genes private to the contrast mismatched, 911 (72.3%) were significant in the contrast age ( Figure 3A and Figure S3 ). This shows that the age difference introduced a substantial number of false positives in the mismatched contrast. On the other hand, age also resulted in a large number of false negatives: around 70% (643) of the genes with significant differences in the evolution contrast were missed in the mismatched contrast ( Figure 3A) . These genes are involved in signal transduction (GO:0007165) and nervous system process (GO:0050877) ( Figure 4C , Table S3 ). About half of these 643 false negatives can be explained by age-related gene expression differences in the opposite direction than evolution ( Figure S3 ). Out of 291 genes identified in the evolution and mismatched contrasts, 13 genes changed expression in the opposite direction ( Figure 3C ). Three of these genes are involved in dendrite guidance (GO:0070983, p = 5.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ) ( Figure 4D , Table S3 ). Genes 2019, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 1 Figure 3 . Age confounds the adaptive response in gene expression. (A) Three-way Venn diagram of genes identified by different contrasts. (B) Scatter plot of expression changes (log ) in the contrast evolution (x-axis) and the contrast age (y-axis). Although some adaptive genes were not affected by age (light red), as many as 434 adaptive genes (46%) were affected by age difference. While the age difference may have exaggerated the true signals of adaptive response (dark green), it mostly masked true adaptive signals (dark orange). In addition, 1617 genes showed significant age difference-specific expression changes (light green). (C) Scatter plot of expression changes (log ) in the contrasts evolution (x-axis) and mismatched (y-axis). Consistent true signals are shown with dark red dots, while false positive and false negative signals are indicated in light purple and red, respectively.

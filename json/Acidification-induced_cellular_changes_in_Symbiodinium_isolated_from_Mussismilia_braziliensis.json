Scleractinian corals cannot survive for long periods without their symbionts. These algae, also known as zooxanthellae, on the other hand, thrives outside the coral cells. The free-living populations of zooxanthellae are essential for the resilience of the coral to environmental stressors such as temperature anomalies and ocean acidification.

In this study we aimed to test morphological, physiological and biochemical responses of zooxanthellae from the Symbiodinium genus isolated from the coral Mussismilia braziliensis, endemic to the Brazilian coast, to acidification led by increased atmospheric CO 2. We tested whether photosynthetic yield, cell ultrastructure, cell density and lipid profile would change after up to 16 days of exposure to pH 7.5 in an atmospheric pCO 2 of 1633 \u03bcatm. Photosynthetic yield and cell density were negatively affected and chloroplasts showed vesiculated thylakoids, indicating morphological damage. Moreover, Symbiodinium fatty acid profile drastically changed in acidified condition, showing lower polyunsaturated fatty acids and higher saturated fatty acids contents, when compared to the control, non-acidified condition. These results show that seawater acidification as an only stressor causes significant changes in the physiology, biochemistry and ultrastructure of free-living Symbiodinium.",

This endosymbiotic relationship is particularly important for reef-building corals because they play a crucial role in the construction of the reef ecosystem, whose maintenance depends on this symbiosis [2, 3] . This photosynthetic protist is responsible for providing up to 95% of the energy necessary for the coral, by mediating the translocation of the photosynthetically fixed carbon to glucose, glycerol and amino acids to the host [5, 6] . In addition, the symbiont's cells supply large amounts of oxygen to the host, leading to a significant increase in the rates of mitochondrial respiration, and ATP levels. In scleractinian corals this energy input allows the deposition of calcium carbonate and consequently increases in biomineralization rates [7, 8] .",

When in hospite, they are kept in the cocoid stage and, when free-living, they can be found in either one of these stages. Corals obtain their zooxanthellae either through horizontal or vertical transmissions, depending on the reproduction type: brooders tend to get their symbionts vertically from their progenitors and broadcast spawners tend to acquire the zooxanthellae from the environment [10, 11] . Thus, the availability of free-living populations of zooxanthellae is crucial for both the establishment and the persistence of the symbiosis.",

Therefore, these cells have carbon concentration mechanisms (CCM) which are essential for a high photosynthetic yield [57] [58] . A previous study [59] has shown that free-living Symbiodinium cells (formerly known as clade A2) had a higher photosynthetic yield on pH 7.7, suggesting that a higher pCO 2 could be beneficial to Symbiodinium cells. However, our study showed that after 16 days at pH 7.5 there are enough structural damage on the chloroplast to make the photosynthetic yield to decrease drastically on Symbiodinium. This could be due to less RuBisCO available or even to a less efficient CCM on this particular strain. Concerning the response of in hospite Symbiodiniaceae to an acidic condition, It has been previously demonstrated that the low pH of symbiosome lumen can be beneficial as it promotes the conversion of HCO 3 to CO 2 , which occurs almost instantaneously in the presence of carbonic anhydrases [60] . This process increases the local concentration of CO 2 surrounding the algal cell (in symbiosome lumen), which then diffuses across the cell wall and plasma membrane of the symbiont. Therefore, a low pH condition may not be the unique stressing factor to free-living zooxanthellae. Maybe, the negative response to acidification treatment can be also attributed to other changes in seawater chemistry, to the uncontrolled increase of dissolved CO 2 and to the absence of cellular modifications like those allowing the survival inside host cells and induced by the symbiotic process.",

Here we found a clear growth inhibition on free living Symbiodinium submitted to acidified condition. Moreover, our data showed a negative intrinsic rate of increase on the acidified condition, indicating a population decline. Similarly, previous study showed that the cell cycle dynamics of cultured Symbiodiniaceae also was influenced by heat stress, which specifically caused the cell cycle arrest in G 1 phase [62] . Apart from that, membrane debris observed on CMLS images with NR staining and highly vesiculated cells seen on TEM images also indicate cell death.

Here we found that, after 16 days, the samples from the acidified condition had a decrease of PUFA diversity and content. This, combined with the damaged chloroplasts seen on TEM images, suggests that high pCO 2 atmospheric level affected the chloroplasts to the point of impair the normal FA synthesis. Moreover, some PUFA play important roles in plant cells by protecting and helping the fluidity of the thylakoids membranes and the electron flow between electron acceptors of photosystem II [65] [66] [67] . This could explain the apparent increased percentage of PUFA in the acidified samples from 8 days as an initial response of the cell that might have resulted in the protection of the chloroplast from the cell stress caused by the acidification. Thus, we show that, at least in this particular strain, free-living Symbiodiniaceae could resist a lower pH in a short-term period. Furthermore, the LD's saturation analysis showed a higher saturated content on acidified samples after 16 days, which corroborates to the decrease in PUFA percentage and diversity and the increase in SFA.",

Moreover, these n-6 FA, as well as n-3 FA (such as C18:4n-3 and C22:6n-3) are known to be translocated from symbionts to hosts [70, 71] . Therefore, it has been recently suggested that an appropriate balance of n-3 and n-6 is crucial for the coral holobiont health [68, 69] and, hence, the n-3:n-6 ratio could be a good putative FA indicator [72] . Our data showed that both of the n-6 PUFA that were present in all samples disappeared after 16 days on the acidified condition. This indicates that acidification might interfere not only in the synthesis of essential FA, but also in the free-living symbiont's health as a hole. Moreover, these results, combined with the lipid droplets saturation analysis suggest that, at lower PH, Symbiodiniaceae from the genus Symbiodinium reduce their capacity of producing unsaturated FA.",

We hypothesize that this also happens with Symbiodinium cells under low pH, i.e. the ability of Symbiodinium to synthesize new PUFA is reduced due to damage in the thylakoid membranes. Therefore, the photosynthetic machinery cannot be repaired leading photosynthetic yield to drop.",

These works are in agreement with the G 1 arrest caused by heat stress observed in cultured Symbiodinium [62] . Considering our results that revealed severe photosynthesis impairment and a decrease of important FA species, the inhibition of population growth on the acidified condition could be related to cell cycle arrest. On the other hand, a broad programmed cell death event cannot be disconsidered once diverse environmental stress can lead to this cell condition [77] and also because of the altered chloroplast morphology, considered a hint of this process [78] , in Symbiodinium cells submitted to water acidification. Finally, although Bray-Curtis analysis showed no similarity patterns amongst the samples regarding sterol composition, Dinosterol was not found in samples from acidified condition after 16 days. Dinosterol is considered a dinoflagellate biomarker [79] and the inability to produce it by cells submitted to low pH for a longer period of time may suggest a change in sterol metabolism.",

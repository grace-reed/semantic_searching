Recent studies have shown that OBZ has been detected in women's plasma, urine, and breast milk. However, the effects of OBZ exposure on oocyte meiosis have not been addressed. In this study, we investigated the detrimental effects of OBZ on oocyte maturation and the protective roles of melatonin (MT) in OBZ-exposed mouse models. Our in vitro and in vivo results showed that OBZ suppressed oocyte maturation, while MT attenuated the meiotic defects induced by OBZ. In addition, OBZ facilitated H3K4 demethylation by increasing the expression of the Kdm5 family of genes, elevating ROS levels, decreasing GSH, impairing mitochondrial quality, and disrupting spindle configuration in oocytes. However, MT treatment resulted in significant protection against OBZ-induced damage during oocyte maturation and improved oocyte quality. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial roles of MT involved reduction of oxidative stress, inhibition of apoptosis, restoration of abnormal spindle assembly and up-regulation of H3K4me3. Collectively, our results suggest that MT protects against defects induced by OBZ during mouse oocyte maturation in vitro and in vivo.",

                "text": "The incidence of skin cancer has increased worldwide over the past decades, which has resulted in substantial health and economic burdens [1, 2] . With increasing awareness regarding skin cancer, more than approximately 10,000 tons of ultraviolet (UV) filters are produced for the global market annually and are used to protect skin from direct sunlight [3] . Oxybenzone (2hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl-phenylmethanone, OBZ), also known as benzophenone-3, is an organic UV filter present in plastic surface coatings, sunscreen and personal care products, including lip balm, lotion, hair sprays, and shampoo [4] . Due to the increase in use of OBZ, it has become a ubiquitous environmental contaminant. Some studies have reported that OBZ has been detected in AGING seawater, rivers, lakes, wastewater, swimming pools, and even drinking water [5] [6] [7] . Furthermore, because OBZ can be readily absorbed by human skin, detectable levels of OBZ have been found in human urine, breast milk, serum, cord and blood [8, 9] . Recently, Matta et al. (2019) showed that the geometric mean maximum plasma concentration of OBZ ranged from 740 nM (169.3 ng/mL) to 920 nM (209.6 ng/mL), which exceeded the FDA level for toxicological concern (0.5 ng/mL or 2.2 nM) [10] . Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the potential health risks of OBZ exposure.",

                "text": "Numerous studies have shown the negative effects of OBZ on the reproductive system, where it acts as an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) [11] [12] [13] . In fish, OBZ exposure caused a reduction in egg production and induced egg protein production in males and juveniles [14, 15] . One prior study by Balazs et al. (2016) showed that OBZ exposure increased mortality and developmental disorders in zebrafish embryos [16] . In rodents, OBZ reduced body weight and uterine weight, increased abnormal sperm levels, decreased epididymal sperm density, altered gland morphology and function, prolonged the estrous cycle, and induced idiopathic sudden death in lactating mothers [6, 11, 17, 18] . A recent in vitro study showed that exposure to OBZ (5.8 nM) decreased the total number of oocytes, the number of nests per ovary and the early primary follicle population, indicating that OBZ perturbed the early events of germ cell development in rat whole ovary cultures [19] . In humans, OBZ exposure was associated with pregnancy duration, body weight, head circumference, fetal growth, and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) [13, 20, 21] . Because of the potential risks of OBZ, it has been banned in Hawaii, Florida, US Virgin Islands, Palau, Bonaire, and nature reserve sites in Mexico [22, 23] . To our knowledge, there have been no reports on the toxic effects of OBZ on mouse oocyte maturation, and its specific mechanisms remain unknown.",

Our results showed that OBZ exposure altered histone modifications and caused oxidative stress, which was followed by early apoptosis, decreased mitochondrial quality, and disrupted spindle organization. MT effectively restored the abnormal levels of trimethyl-histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), suppressed oxidative stress, reduced the amount of early apoptosis, and ameliorated the deterioration induced by OBZ exposure in mouse oocytes.",

Our study provided the first evidence that OBZ reduced the rate of PBE in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that OBZ exposure perturbs normal meiotic progression. In addition, the blastocyst formation rate was significantly decreased by OBZ exposure. Similar effects were also reported from previous studies in OBZ-exposed mouse neuronal cells and human 293T cells [21, 33] . It is noteworthy that the human plasma concentration of OBZ ranged from 740 nM to 920 nM, while the FDA safety threshold is 0.5 ng/mL (approximately 2.2 nM) [10] . However, our data from an in vitro study showed that more than 25 nM OBZ exposure led to a significant decrease in the percentage of oocytes extruding the polar body ( Figure  1 ), revealing the need for additional studies investigating the safety of OBZ. In our in vivo study, OBZ exposure did not affect body weight or ovary weight in mice. Interestingly, the mean whole blood concentration of OBZ in OBZ-exposed mice was 0.21 ng/mL, which fell below the threshold, but the PBE rate of oocytes in the OBZ exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group. This observation implies that mice may be more susceptible to OBZ exposure than humans, but that requires further investigation. Research within the last decade has found that MT plays a key role in a variety of physiological functions in tissues and cell types, including ovarian function, oocyte maturation, and embryonic development [34, 35] . In ART, MT would be expected to elevate the pregnancy rate by improving the quality of oocytes as well as promoting the fertilization rate and embryo development [30] . We thus propose that MT can ameliorate OBZ-induced oocyte meiotic failure and decreases in embryonic developmental competence. As expected, the detrimental effects of OBZ on oocyte maturation and early embryo development could be rescued by treatment with low concentrations of exogenous MT (10 -7 M). Moreover, in line with previous studies, the appropriate concentration of MT (10 -7 M) supplementation could alleviate ochratoxin A and paraquat-induced toxicity in porcine and bovine oocytes [24, 35] . These results were also confirmed by our in vivo experiments.",

Research within the last decade has found distinct H3K4me3 landscapes during mouse oocyte growth and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) [37] [38] [39] . Some broad, noncanonical forms of H3K4me3 (exceeding 5 kb) were widely observed in full-grown and mature oocytes. ZGA during the two-cell stage is associated with re-establishment of canonical H3K4me3 marks, which are restricted to the transcription start site of transcriptionally active genes. Unlike in mouse oocytes, H3K4me3 largely exhibits canonical patterns at promoters in human oocytes [40] . After fertilization, pre-ZGA embryos acquire permissive chromatin and widespread H3K4me3 in CpG-rich regulatory regions. Therefore, the distribution of H3K4me3 plays critical roles in oocyte meiotic maturation and subsequent embryo development. In the present study, we found that OBZ exposure significantly decreased the average fluorescence intensity of H3K4me3 and increased the transcript levels of Kdm5b, which is capable of demethylating tri-, di-and monomethylated lysine 4 of histone H3. These findings are in line with previous studies showing that aberrant Kdm5b and H3K4me3 levels could affect oocyte maturation and meiosis resumption [41, 42] . A previous study [43] showed that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) knockdown increased Kdm5b levels and decreased H3K4me3 levels at the promoters of the positively regulated genes in MCF-7 cells. PARP-1 shows a dynamic association with distinct nuclear compartments in the GV of pre-ovulatory oocytes and upon meiotic resumption, with critical components of the meiotic spindle as well as pericentric heterochromatin domains in mature metaphase II eggs [44] . Thus, MT prevented OBZ-induced increase in Kdm5b expression and demethylation of H3K4me3 might associate with reduction of PARP-1 expression. This was consistent with our in vivo experiments and previous studies, which showed that MT rescued abnormal epigenetic alterations in EDC-exposed oocytes [35, 45] .",

Activation of intracellular ROS is highly associated with OBZ-induced toxicity in many cell types [33, 47] . Our results showed that OBZ exposure significantly increased ROS levels and decreased GSH levels compared with those of the control. Furthermore, the expression of Sod1 and Gpx1 decreased in the OBZtreated group. As Sod1 and Gpx1 play important roles in protecting cells from oxidative damage [48] , our results demonstrated that OBZ promoted oxidative stress during mouse oocyte maturation. A recent study demonstrated that a deficiency in fibroblast peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (PPARs) increased oxidative stress in wound microenvironment [49] . It is reported that ROS triggers activation of ERK1/2, PDGF, and PI2K/Akt resulting in increased transcription of PPARs [50] . Moreover, PPARs play a protective role in cardiovascular function by increasing activities of antioxidant genes, such as Sod1, Sod2, and catalase [51] . It is worth noting that melatonin treatment significantly increases the expression of PPAR in mice [52] , rats [53] , and different AGING cells [52, 54] , which indicates the intertwine between transcription regulator and circadian clocks. Therefore, the protective roles of melatonin against toxicity of oxybenzone exposure during in vitro and in vivo maturation of mouse oocytes might be associated with PPAR signaling pathway to reduce ROS production.",

Thus, demethylation of H3K4me3 in OBZ-exposed oocytes may combat oxidative stress. In addition, oxidative stress leads to apoptosis, which is generally activated by EDCs, such as ochratoxin A [24] , bisphenol A [29] , and aflatoxin B1 [56] . We then examined early apoptosis in oocytes through the use of Annexin-V staining, which has a high affinity for phosphatidylserine. The results showed that the early apoptosis levels in the OBZ group were higher than those in the control group. Furthermore, OBZ significantly upregulated Bax, Caspase-3, and P53 and downregulated Bcl2 gene expression ( Figure 3) . Likewise, MT treatment increased the expression of Bcl2 and decreased the transcript levels of Bax, Caspase-3, and P53, suggesting that MT blocked early apoptosis in OBZ-treated oocytes. This is consistent with the findings reported in previous studies [45, 57] . Similar to our in vitro study, MT ameliorated oxidative stress and early apoptosis in vivo.",

Melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) were identified in the mitochondrial membrane and loss of the MT1 enhanced neuronal vulnerability and potentially accelerated the neurodegenerative process [58] . In another study conducted by Onphachanh et al. (2017) [59] , melatonin receptor 2 (MT2) improved neuronal cell survival in response to high-glucose insult through PINK1 activation, stimulation of Akt phosphorylation, and resultant preservation of mitochondrial function. Melatonin treatment or MT2 overexpression suppressed the activation of markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress (cleaved caspase-12 and CHOP) and mitochondria (cleaved caspase-9 and cytochrome c) without affecting cleaved caspase-8 activity [60] . It is noteworthy that MT2 mutation is associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk and obese [61, 62] . Considering the fact that diabetes and obesity is a well-known risk factor for Polycystic ovary syndrome, MT2 might be regarded as a potential therapeutic target when designing clinical trials to examine melatonin-based therapy for oocyte maturation failure. In this study, MitoTracker and mitochondrial membrane potential assays were utilized to explore the distribution of mitochondria and the mitochondrial membrane potential state in oocytes. Our data from in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that OBZ exposure impaired the uniform distribution of mitochondria and decreased mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8m, whereas MT could rescue OBZ-induced mitochondrial defects. These findings are in line with previous studies showing that MT supplementation improved mitochondrial quality during oocyte maturation [24, 63] . However, whether MT1 and MT2 are involved in the protective effects of melatonin on OBZ-exposed oocytes requires further investigation. Mitochondria have been shown to affect spindle alignment in higher eukaryotes [64] , and proper spindle formation is important for the orchestration of meiotic progression. In the present study, we found that OBZ exposure adversely influenced spindle configuration and chromosome alignment. In studies using oocytes from mice and pigs, it has been reported that impaired spindle assembly and alignment can be restored upon in vitro incubation of oocytes in culture medium supplemented with MT [29, 56] . As expected, treatment with MT improved the quality of oocytes by reducing the frequency of spindle defects. These observations were also confirmed by our in vivo experiments.",

We found that OBZ exposure altered histone H3K4 methylation, induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, caused mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired spindle assembly, which further influenced the maturation of mouse oocytes in vitro and in vivo. By applying an appropriate level of MT, we found that the OBZ-induced adverse effects can be effectively reversed. Our study provides insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of OBZ and identified a potential means for melatonin to reduce OBZ-induced damage in oocytes, which may provide a promising reference for further studies to consider the safety threshold of OBZ.",

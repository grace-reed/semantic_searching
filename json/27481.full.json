                "text": "The sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Anthozoa, Cnidaria) is a powerful model for characterizing the evolution of genes functioning in venom and nervous systems. Although venom has evolved independently numerous times in animals, the evolutionary origin of many toxins remains unknown. In this work, we pinpoint an ancestral gene giving rise to a new toxin and functionally characterize both genes in the same species. Thus, we report a case of protein recruitment from the cnidarian nervous to venom system. The ShK-like1 peptide has a ShKT cysteine motif, is lethal for fish larvae and packaged into nematocysts, the cnidarian venom-producing stinging capsules. Thus, ShK-like1 is a toxic venom component. Its paralog, ShK-like2, is a neuropeptide localized to neurons and is involved in development. Both peptides exhibit similarities in their functional activities: They provoke contraction in Nematostella polyps and are toxic to fish. Because ShK-like2 but not ShK-like1 is conserved throughout sea anemone phylogeny, we conclude that the two paralogs originated due to a Nematostellaspecific duplication of a ShK-like2 ancestor, a neuropeptide-encoding gene, followed by diversification and partial functional specialization. ShK-like2 is represented by two gene isoforms controlled by alternative promoters conferring regulatory flexibility throughout development. Additionally, we characterized the expression patterns of four other peptides with structural similarities to studied venom components and revealed their unexpected neuronal localization. Thus, we employed genomics, transcriptomics, and functional approaches to reveal one venom component, five neuropeptides with two different cysteine motifs, and an evolutionary pathway from nervous to venom system in Cnidaria. venom evolution | toxin recruitment | neuropeptide | nematocyst | neuron T he starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (hereafter, Nematostella) has developed into a model system for characterizing the evolution of genes and their functions. It has a noncentralized nervous system, which comprises morphologically distinguishable sensory, ganglion, and nematocyte neuronal types that develop from the same neural progenitor cells (1) . From a transcriptomic perspective, however, several dozen neuronal subtypes were identified (2) . Unlike in bilaterian animals where neurons differentiate from and are located in the ectoderm, the nervous system of Nematostella spans both the ectoderm and endoderm (3, 4) . Ganglion cells are found in both germ layers while sensory cells and nematocytes are present only in the ectoderm. Nematocytes are highly specialized cells bearing a nematocyst, an organelle loaded with proteinaceous venom that can be discharged upon mechanical stimulation (5) (6) (7) (8) . Thus, nematocytes function as microsyringes injecting venom into prey and predators.",

A significant portion of the venom consists of disulfide-rich peptides of \u223c4-kDa molecular mass (11) . Many of these peptides possess neurotoxic activity and act through binding to a target receptor in the nervous system of the prey or predator interfering with transmission of electric impulses. For example, Nv1 toxin from Nematostella inhibits inactivation of arthropod sodium channels (12) , while ShK toxin from Stichodactyla helianthus is a potassium channel blocker (13) . Nematostella's nematocytes produce multiple toxins with a 6-cysteine pattern of the ShK toxin (7, 9) . The ShKT superfamily is ubiquitous across sea anemones (14) ; however, its evolutionary origin remains unknown. Comparative phylogenetic analyses of various venom components suggest several have originated through a process of gene duplication and recruitment from other physiological systems, such as the digestive, immune, and nervous systems (15) . Additionally, new toxins may originate due to divergence from other toxins following the recruitment to venom (16) or de novo (17) .",

Thirty putative neuropeptide sequences belonging to families widely represented in metazoans (such as RFamide, vasopressin, galanin, tachykinin peptides) as well as cnidarian-specific families (for example, Antho-RIamide, RNamide, RPamide peptides) have been identified in the Nematostella genome (21) . All of the reported mature sequences are relatively short (3 to 15 residues) with a C-terminal amidation signal (Gly residue) and absence of Cys residues (apart from two RPamide peptides). Recently, an approach based on tandem mass spectrometry and a novel bioinformatics pipeline identified 20 new neuropeptide sequences in Nematostella (22) . Some of the new peptides were classified as RFamide and RPamide peptides, which were reported earlier, while others did not share similarity to any known cnidarian neuropeptides. While disulfide-rich neuropeptides have not been reported in cnidarians, preproinsulin-like peptide genes have been characterized in Nematostella (23). These insulin-like peptides are disulfide-rich and expressed in exocrine gland cells, with a single member also expressed in small cells adjacent to neurons. Peptides from the insulin superfamily have also been reported in the neuroendocrine system of other animals (24) (25) (26) .",

We used toxin sequences deposited in UniProt (ToxProt) as a query to identify toxin-like sequences in Nematostella using the previously published Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) dataset from mesenteries, nematosomes, and tentacles (PRJEB13676). This search identified Class8-like peptide, a homolog of Avd8e toxin (e-value 7 \u00d7 10 \u221218 ), and Aeq5-like1, a homolog of Acrorhagin 5a from Actinia equina (e-value 0.005) (31) . Using Transdecoder (32), we translated the TSA sequences and obtained 1,126,514 protein sequences, with 653 sequences with the predictive ShKlike cysteine arrangement, 74 of which were predicted to have a signal region. After screening for multiple ShK-like domains, excessive cysteine residues, and sorting through ToxProt BLAST outputs, we identified transcripts encoding six uncharacterized proteins with a cysteine arrangement typical of the potassium channel blocker from S. helianthus known as ShK (13) (ShK-like1, ShK-like2a, ShK-like2b, ShK-like3, ShK-like4, and Class8-like) ( Fig. 1A and Table 1 ). Additionally, we examined the Nematostella single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data (2) where one gene, Nve8041, was expressed in neurons and coded for a protein with the same Cys pattern as Aeq5a and Aeq5-like1; this we designated as Aeq5-like2 ( Fig. 1B and Table 1 ).",

To study the toxic effects of ShK-like1, the peptide was tested on zebrafish larvae: Five larvae were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL ShK-like1 with four replicates. After 1-h incubation, all of the larvae (20 in total) exhibited contraction paralysis and within 2 h they died, while all of the larvae in BSA control survived (Fig. 2C ). These results are evidence of neurotoxic activity of ShK-like1. Alignment to ShK toxin from S. helianthus (Fig. 1A) shows that key residues required for blocking vertebrate potassium channels are missing in ShK-like1, suggesting that it probably acts through a different mechanism (39) . Thus, ShK-like1 is a nematocyst toxin highly expressed at the planula, for which the neurotoxic target is yet to be determined.",

Early ectodermal cells may represent neuronal precursors for sensory cells. In primary polyps, Aeq5-like1 was expressed in ectodermal sensory cells and multiple endodermal ganglion cells that send their processes in different directions all around the body. ShK-like4 was expressed in ectodermal sensory cells in planulae and oral part of polyps ( Fig. 3 -II). Some of the sensory cells appeared to have cilia ( Fig. 3 -II B and F) and processes at their base ( Fig. 3 -II G and H). Class8-like was expressed in multipolar ganglion cells with long branching processes localized in mesoglea ( Fig. 4-I ). Aeq5-like2 was localized to endodermal ganglion neurons, apparently bipolar and following mesentery folds ( Fig. 4-II) . To the best of our knowledge these patterns are quite unique as in most cases, unlike protein-based staining, RNA-based staining of Nematostella neurons does not reveal neurite like structures (40, 42) . For ShK-like2 ISH, we first synthesized an RNA probe that was relatively long (ShK-like2-long, 603 nt) and specific to the full-length ShK-like2b, which also shared significant portion of the sequence (66%) with the ShK-like2a mRNA (Fig. 5 -I and SI Appendix, Table S2 ). The resulting pattern allowed us to conclude that ShK-like2 was predominantly expressed in ectodermal sensory neurons in planulae and endodermal ganglion cells in primary polyps. To determine whether ShK-like2a and ShK-like2b exhibit different expression patterns, we produced probes that were specific for each isoform. Due to relatively short coding sequences, the ShK-like2a probe (ShK-like2a-short, 372 nt) included 84% of specific sequence while the ShK-like2b probe (ShK-like2b-short, 332 nt) possessed 62% of specific sequence with the rest of the sequence shared between the two isoforms (SI Appendix, Table  S2 ). ISH with the specific probes showed that ShK-like2b was first expressed in the early planula in ectodermal cells and this pattern persisted through the late planula stage, while ShK-like2a was first expressed mostly in the endoderm (with rare ectodermal cells) in the late planula. In primary polyps, expression patterns were indistinguishable: both isoforms were highly expressed in endodermal ganglion cells in the body column and tentacles with rare sensory ectodermal cells ( Fig. 5 -II and 5-III). This pattern was confirmed by significant overlap between stained cells in double fluorescent ISH (dFISH), especially in the tentacle and aboral endoderm (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 ). ISH with a probe for ShK-like3 transcript did not show any specific staining (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ). Neuronal expression patterns are summarized in SI Appendix, Table S3 .",

In larvae, ShK-like2b and Class8-like expression were additionally up-regulated in undifferentiated metacells that may correspond to neural precursors. In adult polyps, these data also supported partial overlap between ELAV and the neuropeptide expression that we observed in dISH on primary polyps: ShK-like4 in the C32 neuronal metacell and ShK-like2b in C34. It also suggested an overlap of Aeq5-like1 and ELAV in C30 neurons that we were not able to detect in our dISH experiments. Thus, our data revealed secretory peptides with cysteine motifs of ShK and Aeq5a toxins to be produced by neurons. ShK-like2 Gene Structure and Evolution. Alignment of the ShK-like2a and ShK-like2b transcripts to the genome (43) showed that both isoforms were encoded by the same gene (scaffold_260:199,854-210,905) with alternative transcription start sites (TSS) (Fig. 6A) . The ShK-like2 gene contains four coding exons, where exon 1 and exon 2 are alternating between the isoforms. Transcription starting from putative promoter A leads to ShK-like2a encoded by exons 1, 3, and 4, while alternative transcription activated by putative promoter B results in ShK-like2b encoded by exons 2, 3, and 4. To confirm that ShK-like2b expression was driven by the alternative promoter B localized upstream of exon 2, we generated a transgenic construct bearing the reporter gene mOrange2 (44) under the control of ShK-like2b regulatory elements. Injection of the transgenic construct into Nematostella zygotes resulted in reporter gene expression in ectodermal cells of the planulae (Fig. 6 B-E) .",

In comparison to the control MO, injection of E3I3 and I3E4 MOs on average reduced planulae settlement by 39.4 \u00b1 8.8% (four replicates) (SI Appendix, Table S7 ) and 83.4 \u00b1 9.4% (three replicates) (SI Appendix, Table S8 ), respectively. The difference in the effects may be explained by the difference in efficiency of each MO. PCR analysis showed that I3E4 led to nearly complete elimination of the processed mRNA, while E3I3 MO injection resulted in partial reduction of the processed mRNA and correctly processed mRNA could be detected as well (SI Appendix, Fig. S11 ).",

The research reported here led to the discovery of two neuropeptide types; however, it was initially aiming to find new toxins in Nematostella transcriptome using UniProt sequences annotated as toxins (including \"toxin by similarity\") and a search for secreted peptides with ShKT motif. Unexpectedly, all but one of the retrieved candidates were found to be expressed in ganglion and sensory neurons, not in nematocytes or ectodermal gland cells. This demonstrates that molecules with structural similarities to venom components have wide expression in different cell types in cnidarians, particularly neurons. Thus, many sequences annotated as venom components based on the sequence similarity or toxic activity without dissecting their tissue localization may have different functions. This mischaracterization is a challenge to overcome as the cnidarian venom system is composed of sparse, dispersed cells rather than an anatomically defined venom gland, leading to technical difficulties in studying venom-specific transcriptomes. Techniques enabling studies of cell-specific transcriptomes have only recently become available in cnidarians and will make this task more manageable (2, 52) .",

To the best of our knowledge, the recruitment of ShK-like1 is unique as a case of a toxin evolving from a neuropeptide and evaluated at the functional level of individual genes in an evolutionary context; it is also unique as a study of toxin recruitment in cnidarians. Processes surrounding venom recruitment have been widely debated, with inconclusive or conflicting findings based on a comparative tissue-specific gene-expression profiling and evolutionary genomic approach (53) (54) (55) . The high sequence similarity between mature ShK-like1 and ShK-like2 peptides (51% amino acid identity) and occurrence of ShK-like1 only in Nematostella provides evidence for recent gene duplication and recruitment events. In cone snails, recruitment of insulin from neuroendocrine cells to venom was suggested. While the similarity between the signaling and venom insulins is mostly limited to the conserved cysteine framework, conserved intron-exon boundaries (26) provide evidence for an ancient gene-duplication event. Thus, while in most other cases the protein recruitment pathway was identified at the level of protein superfamily (15), here we pinpoint an ancestral gene giving rise to a previously undescribed toxin. This unique finding allowed us to characterize both the toxin and the ancestral physiological protein in the same species.",

The other copy likely retained its expression pattern, giving rise to ShK-like2. ShK-like3 appears to result from a duplication of an ancestral ShK-like2 gene as well; however, unlike ShK-like1, it became a pseudogene. We have previously described a similar evolutionary pattern of gene gain and loss for another family of Nematostella venom components (56) . The fact that nematocytes represent a highly specialized neuronal cell type in Nematostella (1) may facilitate recruitment of proteins with typical neural functions to venom, and it is plausible that this evolutionary pathway is recurrent in sea anemones. This is further supported by our discovery of two other neuropeptides with ShK cysteine motif (Class8-like and ShK-like4) and multiple venom components with ShK domains, reported earlier (7); however, theoretically the recruitment in the opposite direction (from venom to nervous system) is also possible (57).",

In other reported cases, the similarity was mostly limited to a shared cysteine framework [e.g., snake threefinger toxins (62, 63) ] or three-dimensional structure (64) . An example of short linear neuropeptides recruited to venom in multiple instances is invertebrate tachykinins (65) . However, such events have been rarely described and it is possible that most neuropeptides make poor toxins because they act mainly via G protein-coupled receptors, which deliver signal too slowly to be an effective target for toxins (28) . Additionally, linear neuropeptides might be less proteolytically stable (66) compared to disulfide-rich peptides (67, 68) , limiting their chances of being efficient venom components. Yet, the small number of known linear neuropeptides recruited in venoms might be partially explained by technical difficulties of their detection by similarity search tools due to short length.",

When new peptides are recruited into the venom system as toxins, they may lose their original function. However, when we tested the ability of ShK-like1 to induce effects in Nematostella, it was as effective as ShK-like2 (Fig. 8A) . Thus, it seems that ShK-like1 retained its ancestral activity to affect the Nematostella nervous system, despite the increased activity on fish. This suggests that increasing potency as a toxin against one species does not necessarily result in decreasing its efficacy on another. It is currently unknown what the pharmacological targets or receptors of ShK-like1 and ShK-like2 are and whether these targets are shared between fish and sea anemones. Both ShK-like1 and ShK-like2 lack residues that have been reported to be important for potassium channel-blocking activity of ShK (Fig. 1A) (39) and therefore they probably act through a different mechanism. Several examples of sea anemone peptides with an ShK fold but lacking potassium channel blocking activity have been reported recently (69, 70) .",

Neuronal localization of peptides of this type has not been reported before. Because multiple disulfide-rich venom components (including ShK toxin) are neurotoxins targeting neuroreceptors, the molecules may potentially act through binding to endogenous receptors in Nematostella.",

One previously reported example is Agatoxin-like peptides in the insect neuroendocrine system, where the sequence similarity to the corresponding spider toxin is quite high (74) . The most characterized group of toxin-like neuroregulators are mammalian prototoxins with significant structural similarity to snake three-fingered toxins (63) . Members of these family can be secreted or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (which makes them similar to the membrane-bound Aeq5-like2).

Total RNA from Nematostella larvae, adults, and female body parts was extracted and cDNA was synthesized as described earlier (9) . We designed qPCR primers specific to the ShK-like2a and ShK-like2b transcripts (SI Appendix, Table S3 ). To quantify transcripts, the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (ABI instrument, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. ANOVA was used to determine if the expression of ShK-like2a and ShK-like2b was significantly different across development and tissues. Ct values were used to calculate relative abundance of the transcripts. DEXseq analysis (45, 89) was performed using a Nematostella transcriptome assembled de novo with Trinity (v2.6.6) (32), previously published raw reads (PRJEB13676) (90) , and the Trinity SuperTranscripts pipeline (32, 89) . Nematostella raw reads (38) generated across development were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (PRJNA418421 and PRJNA419631) and mapped to the SuperTranscripts assembly using STAR (91) .",

The number of alternative signal peptides for each ShK-like2 homolog identified in each genus (transcriptome or genome) is represented by ovals (orange, 2; blue, 1; gray, no homologs); the asterisk denotes that full-length sequences were obtained by joining shorter fragments manually. (B) Alignment of ShK-like2 homologs from different sea anemones. The alignment was built using Clustal Omega online tool with minor manual adjustments. Exon-intron structure is conserved between Nematostella, Actinia, and Exaiptasia (in red) and shown above the alignment.

In particular, soilborne pathogens cause important losses, with fungi being among the most aggressive. Biological control, the use of specific organisms that interfere with plant pathogens and pests, is a nature-friendly ecological approach to overcome problems caused by standard chemical methods of plant protection. Trichoderma spp. are opportunistic fungi found in a large variety of ecosystems. Some strains have the ability to reduce the severity of plant diseases by inhibiting plant pathogens in the soil or on plant roots through their high antagonistic and mycoparasitic potential (47) . Trichoderma spp. produce numerous bioactive secondary metabolites which are species and strain dependent, including volatile and nonvolatile antifungal substances (38, 46) . Some Trichoderma rhizosphere-competent strains that can colonize root surfaces have been shown to have direct effects on plants, increasing their growth potential and nutrient uptake, fertilizer efficiency utilization, percentage and rate of seed germination, and induced systemic resistance (ISR) to diseases (37) .",

Many fungi isolated from various marine habitats have been found to be taxonomically closely related to species that are well known from terrestrial environments (16, 29, 31, 48, 50) . Paz et al. (29) isolated 85 fungal taxa from the Mediterranean Sea sponge Psammocinia sp., mainly by using a sample-compressing method in combination with fungicide-amended media. Abundant terrestrial taxa, such as Acremonium and Penicillium, were found along with potentially undescribed Phoma and Trichoderma species. The role (if any) of the fungi found in the Psammocinia species has yet to be elucidated. Since sponges are filter feeders, it is conceivable that fungal propagules have been filtered from the water (and some of these may originate from land, via dust and runoff) and are lodged in the sponge tissues, thus having no active role in the biology of the sponge (as has been suggested in the case of the coral pathogen Aspergillus sydowii, which is found in Spongia obscura [11] ). The aim of this study was to characterize the marine Trichoderma isolates to assess the potential of marine-derived isolates as halotolerant biocontrol agents.",

PDA-filled and empty HS vials were used to record background (blank) chromatograms to evaluate substances originating from the culture medium, bleeding of the GC stationary phase, or the SPME fiber coating. The analytical procedure and conditions used were the following: samples were placed in 20-ml-headspace vials and equilibrated in the incubator at 50\u00b0C for 10 min; to sample the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), an SPME fiber (65 m polydimethylsiloxane-divinylbenzene [PDMS-DVB]; Supelco) was exposed in the incubated vial at 50\u00b0C for 20 min, and the analytes then were desorbed from the fiber at 240\u00b0C in a split/splitless injector equipped with a 0.75-mm-innerdiameter liner in split (1:5) mode.

The isolates were identified as members of four established common species, most of which exhibit high opportunistic activity. Strains of H. atroviridis/T. atroviride and T. harzianum sensu lato species complex (H. pseudoharzianum nom. prov.) (10) are well known to be applied as biocontrol agents due to their high antagonistic potential. Moreover, the T. longibrachiatum-H. orientalis species pair has been frequently identified as the causal agent of invasive Trichoderma mycoses (8, 19) . Considering the high numbers of marine sponge T. longibrachiatum-H. orientalis isolates, we can hypothesize that the associations between this species pair and animals are not uncommon, but are until now, except with humans, not well studied.",

Regarding the number of identified species, the diversity of Trichoderma species in the Psammocinia sp. sponge samples is relatively low. However, considering the extreme environmental conditions, e.g., osmotic pressure and the physical effects of the water filtration through the sponge's oscula, the sponge may well be defined as an extreme environment for fungal inhabitation. The strains isolated from a large number of Psammocinia sponges indicate that the biodiversity in marine sponges is not random and could be determined by the low species variability, so only the aggressive opportunistic species survive in these extreme conditions. However, it is interesting that, despite this low species richness, three of the isolates represent two putatively new phylogenetic species, Trichoderma sp. O.Y. 14707 and Trichoderma sp. O.Y. 2407. The latter species is most closely related to H. strictipilosa, while Trichoderma sp. O.Y. 14707 is recognized as a new phylogenetic species. In both cases, none of the strains belonging to these two species revealed special traits that would lead us to speculate that they are limited to this environment. Furthermore, given the fact that some Trichoderma strains have been reported to be potential agents of human mycosis in immunocompromised individuals (8, 19) , proper risk assessment analyses is warranted prior to biocontrol use in agriculture.",

The extent of physiological modifications accompanying the adaptation of these fungi to the marine environment has yet to be fully elucidated. The implications of the changes may extend beyond halotolerance and may include additional characteristics advantageous to biocontrol in changing environments. These may be differentially expressed on the basis of the host-pathogen system and the surrounding conditions. Such advantages may prove beneficial in light of the complexity of the alterations accompanying the use of saline water (including variations among sources of saline water) for irrigation, ranging from effects on soil properties to rhizosphere communities to the physiological state of the plant as well as pathogens. Regardless, adaptation to higher salt concentrations can be used to reduce the probability of fungal/ bacterial contamination in Trichoderma stocks intended for liquid formulations in the on-site cultivation of strains (14) . Thus, the maintenance and/or cultivation of such strains in salt-amended medium also may be an avenue for exploiting the characteristics of marine-derived Trichoderma spp.",

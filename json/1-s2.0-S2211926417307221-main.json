    "abstract": "Wild and cultivated populations of Pyropia haitanensis have frequently experienced extremely low pH conditions in the last few decades. This could potentially threaten the development of the aquaculture of this economically important marine crop. To gain a broader perspective, we investigated the short-(4 h) and long-(7 days) term responses of CO 2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) of P. haitanensis thalli to large variations in pH. Our study found that a pH of 4 and 5, which mimicked the decreased pH caused by acid rain, resulted in decreased photosynthesis and respiration while leading to the death of P. haitanensis thalli. Thus, acid rain would result in a decline in P. haitanensis production and threaten wild seaweed sources. However, a pH of 6 and 7 enhanced the growth of P. haitanensis thalli by > 30%, mainly because increased CO 2 levels favored photosynthesis, while the algae need to effectively maintain intracellular pH homeostasis to support rapid growth rates. The contributions of extracellular carbonic anhydrases (eCAs) to photosynthetic rates remained at > 77% when pH \u2265 7, regardless of the treatment time. However, at pH 6, the contribution of eCAs to photosynthesis increased from 25% for a short-term treatment to 66% for a long-term treatment. Thus, except for work on carbon assimilation, this study proposes that the CCMs component involved in the movement and metabolism of inorganic carbon may play an important role in pH homeostasis. In addition, pH 9 also led to the death of P. haitanensis thalli, which is consistent with observations of the natural distribution of this algae and hints that P. haitanensis thalli prefer to use inorganic carbon via eCAs when pH \u2265 7. The present study suggested that the actual variation in pH experienced by marine organisms needs to be considered in the experimental design of related studies.",

Up to 1806 thousand tons in fresh weight were harvested in 2014 [1] , making Pyropia aquaculture one of the largest man-made marine ecological experiments [4] . The large-scale cultivation of seaweed could improve the coastal environment by mitigating eutrophication and controlling harmful algal blooms [5] . Seaweed aquaculture has great potential in acting as a CO 2 sink to prevent or mitigate ocean acidification [6] ; and two Asian countries, China and Indonesia, are currently the top contributors [1] . P. haitanensis, a species endemic to southern China, provides an annual harvest that accounts for about 70% of the total Pyropia harvest in China [7] . The effects of variations in pH on marine crops have received considerable attention, but most studies have focused on the problem of ocean acidification which represents a small decrease in pH of~0.3-0.4. This small decrease in pH and relative changes on dissolved inorganic carbon are based on the predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [8] ; although this decrease is much smaller than what has occurred under actual field conditions.",

In an emersed condition, macroalgae are exposed to air so that atmospheric CO 2 becomes the only exogenous carbon source. CO 2 diffuses about 10,000 times faster in air than in water [10] . Although the red algae Bostrychia scorpioides cannot absorb atmospheric CO 2 through stomata like higher plants, its photosynthetic rates at an emersed condition with water film on the surface of the thalli was the same as that of the submersed condition [11] , or even higher if the pH of water film was 10 [12] . Aside from ocean acidification, another serious consequence of burning fossil fuels is the formation of acid rain. In South China, major areas have experienced severe acid rain with average values of precipitation with pH < 5 during the past decades including three main P. haitanensis production areas in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces [13, 14] . Furthermore, aerobic respiration of organic carbon could result in a decrease in the pH of estuary seawater down to 5.5 [15, 16] . Farmers prefer to culture Pyropia at estuary areas where relatively high levels nutrients could promote the growth and yield of these algae [17, 18] . As a result, both wild and cultivated P. haitanensis crops have frequently experienced extremely low pH levels in recent decades.",

However, because differentiating the isolated effects of complex seawater carbonate chemistry has proved to be difficult, researchers face the challenge of explaining the different mechanisms involved in creating the effects of ocean acidification. Based on the primary metabolic targets, carbonate chemistry parameters can be divide into two categories: pH and dissolved inorganic carbon [21, 22] . The former could influence intracellular pH homeostasis which in turn affects metabolism depending on the intracellular pH, such as occurs in the calcification of corals and coccolithophores [23] [24] [25] [26] . Obviously, the latter will influence the algal CO 2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). The effects of changed dissolved inorganic carbon on photosynthetic rates were extensively studied during recent decades [9, [27] [28] [29] . Most algae quickly adjust their CCMs to respond the enhanced CO 2 concentrations, and photosynthesis has generally been favored. Furthermore, just like the interactions of pH and dissolved inorganic carbon in the seawater [10] , these two also interacted with each other to maintain intracellular pH homeostasis [30, 31] .",

Strain Z-61, a major cultivated strain in Fujian Province, China, was cross-bred from wild strains by the Laboratory of Germplasm Improvements and Applications of Pyropia at Jimei University, Fujian, China. The irradiance was 50 \u03bcmol photons m \u2212 2 s \u2212 1 with 12/12 h light/dark cycles, and the temperature was held at 21\u00b0C. The cultures were continuously aerated with filtered-sterilized air and the medium was refreshed every 2 days. Healthy thalli with a length of~15 cm were randomly selected for the pH exposure experiments. Six different pH levels, using whole numbers ranging from 4 to 9, were adjusted by adding 1 mol/L HCl or 1 mol/L NaOH to fresh medium as appropriate. The thalli were immediately transferred to sealed glass bottles filled with medium. The pH expose experiments were carried out in 5 L borosilicate bottles with the medium changed every day. The daily pH shifts of all the treatments were < 0.5. To investigate the effects of large pH variations on P. haitanensis thalli, two treatment times 4 h and 7 days were applied to mimic the normal exposure times of thalli to acid rain. Generally, P. haitanensis inhabits at the middle and high tide regions which means that the thalli are emmersed for about 4 h during which the thalli may expose to acid rain. In Fujian province, the main P. haitanensis production area, periods of rainy days could last up to 7 days during the first month of the thallus growth stage.",

This could be attributed to the negative effects of the above three pH treatments on photosynthesis and respiration (Figs. 2 & 3) . Recently, farmers and aquaculture technicians have frequently reported that cultivated P. haitanensis thalli appeared to have had an extensive rot after several rainy days induced by a typhoon [38] . Fujian Province in South China is a continuous severe acid rain area with multi-year averaged pH values generally lower than 5 [13, 14] . Our results suggest that the severe acid rain during the cultivation seasons is possibly one of the major reasons for the declines in production and the degradation of wild sources of P. haitanensis in the last few decades. In addition, moderate decrease in pH to 6 and 7 resulted in significantly increased growth rates of this species, which is consistent with its observed photosynthetic response. Some marine macroalgae have shown an ability to tolerate a large decrease in pH; for example, the photosynthetic rates of a marine red algae, Kappaphycus alvarezii, increased with a moderate decrease in pH (down to pH 6) in 4 hour of incubation [32] ; a brown algae, Sargassum vulgare, may have already adapted to life at a lowered pH (down to 6.7), as shown based on it photosynthetic activity and activities of oxidative metabolic enzymes [33] ; a coralline red algae and a green algae Ulva prolifera showed tolerance to low pH in that they could increase the pH of surrounding seawater within sealed bottles from < 4.4 to~8 by sacrificing their CaCO 3 skeleton and photosynthesis, respectively [34, 35] .",

                "text": "As for the effects of pH on Pyropia, previous studies have mainly focused on its physiological responses to ocean acidification (relative small decreases in pH by~0.3-0.4 unit and an increase in CO 2 levels t\u00f5 800-1000 \u03bcatm). The photosynthesis and growth of P. haitanensis increased by ocean acidification under nutrient-enriched conditions [39, 40] . P. yezoensis, another most important cultivated Pyropia species, showed positive growth rate responses to increased CO 2 of 1000 and \u03bcatm [41] . These results are consistent with the conclusion of a review paper that summarized that effects on pH on non-calcifying macroalgae showing it would be favored by ocean acidification [20] . Thus, the increasing levels of atmospheric CO 2 and acid rain, two consequences of burning fossil fuel, would potentially favor and inhibit, respectively, the aquaculture industry of the economically important red algae P. haitanensis. However, the complex environmental changes may have effects on our predictions [3, 42] . The present study emphasized the importance of consideration of the actual variation in pH experienced by marine organisms in studies which focus on the ecological effects of increasing atmospheric CO 2 . The CO 2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) of Ulva intestinalis could have effectively worked in strongly alkalinized seawater with pH > 10; that was believed to be a major reason why this species of macroalgae dominates in rockpools [43] . However, for those species of macroalgae that could not survive in rockpools, their inorganic carbon use mainly depends on extracellular carbonic anhydrases (eCAs) which is inefficient at increasing the CO 2 at site of Rubisco under high pH. In the present study, we found that the contributions of eCAs to photosynthetic rates remained > 77% when pH \u2265 7, regardless of the treatment time. In this way, we propose that the direct absorption of HCO 3 \u2212 in P. haitanensis thalli has only a minor contribution to photosynthesis especially when seawater pH \u2265 7. That is possibly a major cause of the sensitive responses of this algae to pH 9 (Fig. 1) . Observations on the natural distribution of P. haitanensis confirmed the above speculation showing that the inhibition of P. haitanensis thalli has generally been observed on rocks but the species avoids places that will be submersed in the seawater of rockpools during low tide (Supplementary Figs. 1 & 2) . Using photosynthesis, populations of two red algae, P. yezoensis and P. haitanensis, along with a green algae, Ulva, could cause a significant increase in the pH of surrounding seawater in small containers or rockpools [43] [44] [45] . Because photosynthesis of P. haitanensis would be limited by low HCO 3 \u2212 concentrations in alkalinized seawater, these algae could not gain a competitive advantage over the green algae Ulva in rockpools ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ).",

In addition, the expression levels of Ph\u03b1CA1, Ph\u03b1CA2, and Ph\u03b3CA1 were significantly higher in the thallus stage than in the conchocelis stage, and the other three \u03b2 type CAs were expressed at relative lower levels [47] . Although both pH 6 and 7 dramatically increased the seawater CO 2 concentrations (Table 1) , only pH 6 significantly increased the net photosynthetic rates in the short time of incubation experiments (Fig. 2) . These results suggest that photosynthesis of P. haitanensis thalli was not saturated with the CO 2 concentration of 6575 \u03bcatm at pH 7. In addition, the gene expression of the HCO 3 \u2212 transporter was inhibited by pH 7 (Fig. 4g) ; at that pH the thalli still need eCAs to catalyze HCO 3 \u2212 converted into CO which in turn fuels photosynthesis. Photosynthesis benefited from the high CO 2 of 33,089 \u03bcatm at pH 6, and the eCAs made only a minor contribution, which suggests photosynthesis prefers to directly use CO 2 in short-term incubation. Previous studies have reported that Pyropia employs two kinds of carbon fixation mechanisms: a C 3 pathway and a C4-like pathway; the later could be evoked by desiccation [48, 49] . In this study, we investigated six important genes related to photosynthetic carbon fixation (Fig. 6) , including a feature gene of the C 3 pathway (PhRubisco) and two feature genes of the C4-like pathway (PhPEPC and PhPEPCK). Since decreased pH favored the growth of P. haitanensis thalli, we can deduce that photosynthesis benefited from the increase of CO 2 , which may be the reason why the expressions of carbon assimilation genes were mismatched with the effects of pH 6 and 7 on photosynthetic rates.",

Meanwhile, for both pH 6 and 7, the inorganic carbon sources for photosynthesis were mainly uptaken via extracellular CAs (> 66%, Fig. 2) . Thus, between short and long time incubation at lowered pH, the responses showed dramatic differences on both the gene expression and physiological levels. Recent studies separately analyzed the effects of disturbed pH and dissolved inorganic carbon to quantify the effects of ocean acidification on marine algae [21, 22] . However, in the present study, the different responses of CCMs to lowered pH at different time scales hints that CCMs may not be influenced by dissolved inorganic carbon alone.",

Protons play a crucial role in all cellular biochemical reactions [30] . Under physiological conditions, higher eukaryotes including mammals, plants, eukaryotic algae and bacteria generally exhibit strict cytosolic pH homeostasis at a pH of around 7.2 even when the extracellular pH is far from neutral [30, [50] [51] [52] [53] . For example, the plant cell wall is maintained at an acidic pH of 5 [51] , the typical seawater pH of open oceans ranged between 7.9 and 8.2 and depends on sample location and time [54] . Even when the pH decreased from 7 to 2, the acidophilic green algae Chlamydomonas sp. sustained an average cytosolic pH of 6.6 [53] . Obviously, the cytosolic pH would influence the metabolism of a cell, but the mechanism controlling the maintenance of the cytosolic pH at such a conserved value under normal conditions needs to be explained. In addition, the relative complexity of highly compartmentalized eukaryotic cells, with different pH levels in the various compartments, makes it difficult to study the regulatory mechanisms of cytosolic pH. A recent study reported that a neutrophilic green algae Chlamydomonas reindardtii could proliferate at pH 5-8, and its acidophilic relative C. esitogma proliferated at pH 2-6 [55] . These studies indicate some algae are tolerant of large variation of pH.",

                "text": "However, to maintain cellular pH homeostasis at pH 6, P. haitanensis thalli must rapidly efflux H + when bathed in strongly acidified seawater. Roos and Boron [31] suggested that the long-term cellular pH buffering capacity depends on movement and production of HCO 3 \u2212 , an effective proton buffer which is the major chemical used to reduce the effects of challenges on the intracellular pH. Our data also support a functional link between the increased growth rate and up-regulated gene expressions of CCMs and carbon fixation. Based on our physiological and molecular analyses, we propose the following model (Fig. 8) . Although CO 2 is electroneutral and membrane permeant, the diffusion rates of this small molecule are regulated by biological membrane system [30, 57] . The high seawater CO 2 concentration would lead to an increase of the cytosolic CO 2 concentration, which could potentially decrease the intracellular pH [31] . The extremely high CO 2 in the seawater will convert into HCO 3 \u2212 and this process will be greatly accelerated by extracellular CA; then HCO 3 \u2212 will being moved inside the cell through the HCO 3 \u2212 transporter. The conversion of CO 2 and HCO 3 \u2212 via intracellular CA can prevent the influx of CO 2 and reduce the effects of protons on pH homeostasis. If the intracellular pH was affected, the cellular metabolisms would be disturbed and the growth rates under pH 6 should not higher than pH 8. In addition, the algae also apply a C4-like pathway to use cytosolic HCO \u2212 for photosynthetic carbon fixation. This model was supported by the high inhibition of AZ on photosynthesis at pH 6 ( Fig. 2d) , and the enhanced expressions of related genes (Figs. 5 & 7) .",

Our results showed that pH 4, 5, and 9 resulted in the death of P. haitanensis thalli, but pH 6 and 7 showed positive effects on growth. This study suggests P. haitanensis thalli could maintain intracellular pH homeostasis at pH 6 and 7 to support rapid growth rates. The different responses of CCMs to shortand long-term pH 6 treatment hints that CCMs not only respond to the changed inorganic carbon induced by decreased pH, but also play a role in intracellular pH homeostasis to relieve the effects of decreased pH. However, the actual pH variations were ignored in most of the studies which focused on the ecological effects of increasing atmospheric CO 2 Fig. 8 . Model indicating the role of CO 2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) on pH homeostasis in P. haitanensis thalli under pH 6. The CCMs improve photosynthesis by increasing the concentration of CO 2 at the site of Rubsico, and initiate from absorbing CO 2 and HCO 3",

In addition, the influx of CO 2 is limited by the cell membranes to avoid the effects of high concentration of CO 2 on intracellular pH [30, 57] . Generally, many types of algae employee H + channels to maintain intracellular pH hemostasis; for example, they absorb H + from surrounding seawater to offset the effects of photosynthesis on pH [50] . The interconversion of CO 2 and HCO 3 \u2212 via intracellular CAs (iCAs) can prevent CO 2 influx and reduce the impact on pH homeostasis.

Six carbonic anhydrase genes (Ph\u03b3CA1, Ph\u03b2CA1, Ph\u03b2CA2, Ph\u03b1CA1, Ph\u03b1CA2, and Ph\u03b1CA3), one HCO \u2212 transporter gene (PhBIC), and six key enzyme genes of photosynthetic carbon fixation (PhRubisco, PhcpFBP, PhcFBP, PhSBP, PhPEPC, and PhPEPCK) were selected to analyze their responses to changed pH. qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression levels of selected genes. The reactions of qRT-PCR were carried on 96-well plates using an ABI 7300 Realtime PCR Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Reactions were performed in 25-\u03bcL volumes containing 12.5 \u03bcL of 2 \u00d7 SYBR green MasterMix (ToYoBo, Osaka, Japan), 0.25 \u03bcL (20 mmol/L) of each sense and antisense primers, 2 \u03bcL of the diluted template, and 10 \u03bcL of RNA-free water. The ubiquitin conjugating enzyme gene was chosen as an internal control gene. The sequence of each primer is shown in",

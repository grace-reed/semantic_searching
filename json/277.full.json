                "text": "Despite the great ecological importance of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these relationships are established, maintained, or disrupted (Davy et al. 2012) . This situation has resulted in part from the difficulties inherent in studying corals directly (Weis et al. 2008) . Thus, we and others have turned to the small sea anemone Aiptasia, which is normally symbiotic with dinoflagellates closely related to those found in corals (Lajeunesse et al. 2012) but offers many experimental advantages (Weis et al. 2008) . In particular, Aiptasia lacks the calcareous skeleton that hinders biochemical and microscopic analyses of corals, grows rapidly by asexual reproduction under standard aquarium conditions to form large clonal populations, can be induced to spawn and produce larvae throughout the year in the laboratory (S. F. Perez and J. R. Pringle, unpublished data) , and (importantly for this study) can be maintained indefinitely in an aposymbiotic (bleached) state so long as it is fed regularly (Schoenberg and Trench 1980) . The intracellular localization of the dinoflagellate (Figure 1 ) raises some key questions about regulation of the symbiosis. First, how does the host recognize, take up, and maintain appropriate symbionts without generating a deleterious immune response that could result in a failure of algal uptake, digestion of the algae after uptake, or apoptosis of the host cells? Second, what metabolites do the two organisms exchange across the symbiosome membrane, and how? It seems likely that the symbiotic state involves both transporters and regulation of metabolic pathways that are distinct from those found in aposymbiotic animals. Third, what changes in transport occur at other membranes? For example, although both gastrodermal and epidermal cells in aposymbiotic anemones presumably excrete ammonium as a toxic waste product, as do other aquatic invertebrates (Wright 1995) , at least some of that ammonium must be redirected to the dinoflagellates in symbiotic anemones (Pernice et al. 2012) . Particularly intriguing questions are how the epidermal tissue layer is nourished (as it lacks both dinoflagellate symbionts and direct access to food particles in the gastric cavity) and whether the nature and mechanisms of this nourishment change upon the establishment of symbiosis.",

This transcriptome was then used as a reference to compare global transcript abundances between symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones. Previous studies have identified few genes that were differentially expressed between the two states, possibly because of the insensitivity of the technologies used, the small fraction of cells that contain dinoflagellates, and/or a lack of probes for the relevant genes. In contrast, we identified nearly 1000 genes with significant expression differences, many of which were large. Many of these expression differences suggest interesting and testable biological hypotheses.",

These two cell layers are separated by the largely acellular mesoglea.

Contigs were aligned locally in both directions and clustered together if the alignment consisted of $20% of the total length of each contig and the sequence was $99% identical over the alignment. These parameters were chosen because they produced valid clusters on a test dataset from zebrafish in 93% of cases (with the remaining cases being mostly the near-identical paralogs common in teleosts because of genome duplication) (E.

The basic principle of TopSort is that if there are N features for each element in a dataset, each element can be represented as a point defined by these features in N-dimensional hyperspace. If classes of elements are distinguishable by the N features, then there should be an N-1-dimensional hyperplane that cuts the space such that one class can be separated from the others. If elements are clustered such that they are separable by another shape in N-space (e.g., a hypersphere), then an appropriate transform of the hyperspace to another space will make them separable by a hyperplane. The features used for TopSort were GC content, amino acid and codon biases (where a strong BLAST hit allowed a reliable prediction of reading frame), phylogenetic classification of the top five best BLAST hits to the nr database (scoring each hit as cnidarian, non-cnidarian animal, dinoflagellate, non-dinoflagellate alveolate, plant, fungus, bacteria, or none-of-the-above), and best BLAST hit to a custom database composed of the sequences of known origin that were not chosen for either the training or test set. BLAST hits to the species from which the training and test sequence sets were derived were discarded to avoid the potential development of a classifier that was highly accurate on the test and training sets but useless for a novel dataset.",

We aligned the genomic read-pairs to our contigs and obtained the mean count of read-pairs for each contig from the six libraries.

However, this clade B strain may have many sequence differences from the clade A strain found in CC7 anemones, so it seemed conceivable that low levels of Symbiodinium in the putatively aposymbiotic anemones from which the genomic DNA was derived might lead to misclassification of dinoflagellate transcripts as cnidarian. We determined that 15,499 of the 23,794 contigs classified as dinoflagellate by TopSort had zero genomic reads mapping to them, whereas the median of the mean read counts for the contigs classified by TopSort as cnidarian was $200.

Based on this analysis, the genes encoding 60S ribosomal protein L11, 40S ribosomal protein S7, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5, and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase were selected as standards. The stabilities of these genes in experiment 3 were confirmed using geNorm before calculating a normalization factor from the geometric mean of their expression values (Vandesompele et al. 2002) (Table S1 ). The expression levels of all 29 genes were then normalized via the normalization factor, and relative expression values were calculated using the following equation: 1/(1 + Primer Efficiency)^C T . Log 2 fold-changes in expression in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic anemones were then calculated as the quotients of the relative expression values from the aforementioned equation.

Sequences of reliably known origin were used to create training and test sets, and each contig was scored on several metrics (see Materials and Methods).

Thus, we also aligned reads from Aiptasia genomic-DNA sequence libraries to the transcriptome (see Materials and Methods). Approximately 94% of the contigs classified by TopSort as cnidarian had supporting genomic evidence, as compared to only $5% of contigs classified by TopSort as noncnidarian (Table 2 , columns C-E).

In contrast, some accession numbers were hit by much larger numbers of representative contigs (Table 5 ). Although there are several possible explanations for such cases (including the existence of extended gene families, complex alternative splicing, and/or somatic differentiation), we suspect that most reflect a failure of contigs derived from the same gene to cluster with the algorithm used, perhaps because of repeat structures within the genes. In any case, if we assume (as a worst-case scenario) that all such cases result from such failures to cluster, and that the failure rate was identical between the successfully annotated and unannotated contigs, then we can infer that the numbers of \"unigenes\" (sequences derived from distinct genes) present in our dataset are $14,500 for Aiptasia and $14,000 for Symbiodinium, representing substantial fractions of the total gene numbers expected from information on other eukaryotes (see Discussion).",

Although the two experiments identified many of the same genes, there were also differences that probably reflect both the noise inherent in such analyses and actual differences in expression attributable to the different experimental conditions. However, we hypothesized that any genes involved directly in the maintenance of symbiosis (e.g., genes encoding proteins found specifically in the symbiosome) would show similar expression differences in both experiments. Therefore, we identified these contigs (Table 6 , column D) and focused on them in subsequent analyses.",

Consistent with a previous study of the anemone Anemonia viridis (Ganot et al. 2011), we identified multiple transcripts encoding Npc2-like proteins in the Aiptasia transcriptome and in the transcriptomes of three other cnidarians. A multiplesequence alignment and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis identified two subclades, suggesting that there has been at least one duplication event in the Anthozoan lineage ( Figure 2A ). One subclade (including the Npc2A proteins of both A. viridis and Aiptasia) clustered with the canonical Npc2 proteins found in most animals (including mammals and Drosophila), whereas the second subclade contained both the A. viridis (Sabourault et al. 2009; Ganot et al. 2011) and Aiptasia Npc2D proteins that are upregulated during symbiosis. Strikingly, all of the proteins in this second subclade have sequence alterations at conserved positions in the sterol-binding site ( Figure 2B ). Mutations to alanine at these positions are known to disrupt cholesterol binding in human cells (Ko et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2010) , raising interesting questions about the roles of these proteins in symbiotic cnidarians (see Discussion).",

                "text": "Lipid metabolism: There appear to be systematic changes in lipid metabolism between symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones. Four genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty-acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a fatty-acid elongase, and \u0394 5 -and \u0394 6 -fatty acid desaturases) were upregulated 3.5-fold to 6.2-fold (Table S4 , lines 1-4), and at least nine genes encoding proteins putatively involved in lipid storage or its regulation were also differentially regulated (Table S4 , lines 5-13). In addition, many genes involved in b-oxidation of fatty acids were upregulated in symbiotic anemones (Figure 3 and Table S4 , lines 17-21, 23, 24, and 30). Although some of the fold-changes were not large, the consistency is striking, and gastrodermal and epidermal cells may well differ in their expression patterns in ways that obscure the full extent of the changes in a particular cell population (see Discussion). Finally, although the glyoxylate cycle (which allows cells to achieve a net synthesis of longer carbon chains from two-carbon units such as those derived by b-oxidation) is not generally present in animal cells, we identified genes putatively encoding its two key enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase (Table S4 , lines 31 and 32), consistent with a previous report of the presence of this cycle in cnidarians (Kondrashov et al. 2006) . Although the malate-synthase transcript showed no statistically significant differential expression, the isocitrate-lyase transcript was upregulated 3.9-fold in symbiotic anemones. Interestingly, we did not see significant upregulation of the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for metabolizing mediumchain and short-chain fatty acyl-CoA (MCAD, SCAD, crotonase, and M/SCHAD in Figure 3 and Table S4 , lines 25-28), suggesting that the metabolic change accompanying the establishment of symbiosis primarily involves long-chain and/or very-long-chain fatty acids.",

(A) Consensus phylogenetic tree constructed from alignments ( Figure S1B ) of 25 Npc2-like proteins (see Materials and Methods). Oscarella carmela, a sponge, served as the outgroup, and the single human Npc2 protein, the single mouse Npc2 protein, and one of the eight Drosophila melanogaster Npc2 proteins were included in the analysis. The cnidarian sequences included are from two corals (Acropora digitifera and Montastraea faveolata), three anemones (Aiptasia sp., Nematostella vectensis, and Anemonia viridis), and a hydrozoan (Hydra magnipapillata). The Npc2-encoding transcripts found to be upregulated in symbiotic anemones, which fall outside the clade containing the mammalian and Drosophila sequences, are shown in red with their foldchanges ( Table 7, downregulated transcripts encoding glutamate dehydrogenases (Figure 4) , which normally catabolize glutamate to a-ketoglutarate and ammonium in animal cells (where the concentrations of ammonium are typically too low to allow the reverse reaction to proceed effectively). The subcellular localization program WoLF PSORT (Horton et al. 2007) predicts that the downregulated and upregulated enzymes should localize to the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively, consistent with a previous report that corals contain both mitochondrial and cytosolic glutamate dehydrogenases (Dudler et al. 1987) . It seems likely that these initially rather puzzling observations (upregulation of one glutamate dehydrogenase and downregulation of another; upregulation of enzymes both of glutamate synthesis and of glutamate breakdown) reflect the differing metabolic needs of different cell types, and/or of different compartments within the same cells, in symbiotic anemones.",

Based on the failure to find a gene encoding cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) in the A. digitifera genome, it was hypothesized that cysteine is an essential amino acid in cnidarians that must be obtained directly from either prey or the symbiont (Shinzato et al. 2011) . However, we found an Aiptasia transcript encoding a CBS (best BLAST hit, rabbit CBS, Q9N0V7; E-value 9e2166), suggesting that anthozoans resemble other animals in their ability to synthesize cysteine from methionine. The CBS transcript was downregulated 2.1-fold in symbiotic anemones, perhaps reflecting a decreased need for cysteine synthesis in the host because it is being supplied directly by the dinoflagellate. Conceivably in more obligately symbiotic corals, the enzyme is never needed and the gene has been lost altogether. It should also be noted that cysteine synthesis via the CBS pathway is a drain on the homocysteine pool, which otherwise remains available for the synthesis of methionine and the SAM cycle. The concordant upregulation of four genes encoding enzymes of the SAM cycle ( Figure 5 ) suggests that it may assume an increased importance in symbiotic animals, although the very wide range of possible methylation targets makes it difficult to guess at the precise biological significance of this regulation. The apparent switch of pathways used for synthesis of methionine from homocysteine ( Figure 5 ) may also reflect an alteration in the kinetics and/or localization of the SAM cycle.",

                "text": "These questions about methionine and cysteine metabolism raised a broader question about the degree to which the amino-acidbiosynthetic capabilities of anthozoans resemble those of bettercharacterized animals, in which 12 of the 20 amino acids needed for protein synthesis cannot be synthesized from central-pathway intermediates and so must be obtained (directly or indirectly) from the diet. To address this question, we asked if the elements of aminoacid-biosynthetic pathways were present in the Aiptasia transcriptome. As expected, it appears that Aiptasia should be able to synthesize the eight generally nonessential amino acids from intermediates in the central metabolic pathways (Table S5, lines 1, 2, 22-36) . In addition, like other animals, they should be able to synthesize arginine from ornithine via the urea cycle (Table S5 , lines 37-42), although a net synthesis of ornithine and arginine would not be possible because of the apparent lack of either an acetylglutamate kinase or an ornithine acetyltransferase (Table S5 , lines 43 and 44). Similarly, although the Aiptasia transcriptome revealed genes encoding various enzymes involved in interconversions within other groups of amino acids, key enzymes needed to synthesize these groups of amino acids from central-pathway intermediates appear to be missing (Table S5, lines 15-17, 45-79) . Thus, Aiptasia, like other animals, apparently must obtain 12 amino acids (or their amino-acid precursors) from their food, their dinoflagellate symbionts, or both. This conclusion is generally compatible with radiolabeling studies suggesting that leucine, isoleucine, valine, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine are all translocated from the dinoflagellates to the host (Wang and Douglas 1999) .",

Moreover, one of the two upregulated genes encodes a predicted guanylate cyclase, which may have many functions unrelated to oxidative stress. The other upregulated gene is one of a pair encoding distinct Aiptasia proteins ( Figure S2A ) that had a human peroxidasin as their top blastx hit (Table S6 , section A). However, a function for these proteins in coping with oxidative stress is doubtful for two reasons. First, the second gene is downregulated in symbiotic animals ( Figure 6A ). Second, despite the blastx results, neither of the Aiptasia proteins contains the peroxidase domain found in canonical peroxidasins with peroxidase activity (Nelson et al. 1994) ( Figure S2, A and B) Inflammation, tissue remodeling, and response to wounding: Of the 15 differentially expressed genes associated with this cluster of GO terms, eight were downregulated and seven were upregulated in symbiotic animals ( Figure 6B ). Despite this heterogeneity, a suggestive pattern was observed in which genes encoding proteins whose homologs are considered pro-inflammatory were mostly downregulated, whereas the three genes encoding proteins whose homologs are considered anti-inflammatory were all upregulated ( Figure 6B and Table  S6 ). The pattern appears even stronger when it is noted that one of the three upregulated genes with a putatively pro-inflammatory function encodes just one of at least three distinct Aiptasia plasma-kallikrein homologs ( Figure S2C ), the other two of which are downregulated ( Figure 6B) , and that the upregulated ficolin may function specifically in recognition of Symbiodinium (Logan et al. 2010) rather than just as a general activator of the complement innate-immunity pathway. Thus, a downward modulation of the host's inflammatory response may contribute to allowing the persistence of dinoflagellate symbionts.",

The animal and algal transcripts were separated bioinformatically using the TopSort algorithm, which we developed for this purpose, and comparisons to genomic sequence obtained from fully aposymbiotic animals. Although the assemblies appear to be of high quality overall, there remain some areas where improvements could be made. For example, it remains unclear both why reads from some genes assembled into multiple contigs that clustered based on regions of nucleotide identity (up to 230 contigs in a cluster) and why a few accession numbers have so many representative transcripts aligning to them. Because it seems unlikely that alternative splicing and gene duplications alone could explain the magnitude of the effects observed, we presume that they result from some combination of these factors and the inherent complexities of de novo transcriptome assembly. For example, two of the contig clusters with the most members encode putative actins and olfactory C proteins. In most animals, actins are encoded by families of genes and expressed at high levels, whereas olfactory C proteins are members of very large gene families. Highly abundant transcripts may have some error-containing reads that recur with sufficient frequency that they are assembled into distinct contigs, and gene families with many members could generate chimeric contigs if they have identical subsequences that are longer than the k-mers used for assembly. In addition, templates derived from more than one gene may arise during the reverse-transcription or PCR steps of library preparation; the resulting fusion reads may lead to incorrect assembly of contigs, as well as increase the proportion of such contigs substantially when the Oases merge function is used [from 3.6% to 12.2% in one reported case (Chu et al. 2013) ]. The question about accession numbers can perhaps be explained by similar mechanisms. One approach that might help with these problems would be to assemble the reads initially with a greater k-mer length and coverage cutoff to obtain fewer misassemblies for the most abundant transcripts and gene families, remove the reads that map to these transcripts, and then assemble the remaining lower-coverage reads with less stringent thresholds.",

To this end, the performance of TopSort could probably be improved in one or more of several ways. First, it could be retrained with a new dataset that includes transcriptome or genome sequence from an axenic clade A Symbiodinium strain (to improve recognition of contigs from the clade A strain resident in Aiptasia stock CC7). Second, it could be extended such that it assigns contigs not just to the four groups used to date (cnidarian, dinoflagellate, fungi, and bacteria) but also to other groups (such as diatoms and ciliates) that may be present in nontrivial amounts in the guts and/or mucous layers of the anemones; this would also require retraining with a dataset that included unequivocal sequences from those groups. Third, the classification metrics could be extended to include other sequence features found to be specific to the phyla of interest [such as the spliced leader sequences thought to be present in many dinoflagellate transcripts (Zhang et al. 2007) ]. In addition to improving the performance of TopSort, its assignments could also be tested further using alignment to transcriptome or genome sequence from a clonal, axenic Symbiodinium strain (preferably of clade A), essentially as we have already done using Aiptasia genome sequence. Ultimately, however, some contigs may remain ambiguous in assignment until assembled genomes of both partner organisms are available for alignment.",

First, the numbers of unigenes found here for both symbiotic partners ($14,000 by conservative estimate) are significantly less than those expected for the full genomes. For Symbiodinium, this probably reflects, at least in part, the existence of many genes that are expressed at significant levels only in free-living and/or stressed organisms. For Aiptasia, it presumably reflects the absence in the current transcriptome of genes that are expressed at significant levels only in specialized and nonabundant cell types (e.g., in nerve and muscle), at other stages in development (e.g., in embryos and larvae), or under other environmental conditions. Second, only 62% and 74% of representative Aiptasia transcripts could be annotated using the SwissProt and nr databases, respectively, and these numbers were even lower (35% and 49%) for Symbiodinium. This incomplete annotation presumably reflects the poor representation in the databases of genes and proteins unique to these relatively understudied organisms, as well as the great phylogenetic distance of the dinoflagellates from more intensively studied groups. Finally, the Symbiodinium transcriptome reported here has not yet been analyzed in depth. However, we should soon be able to use this transcriptome to make interesting comparisons of gene expression in this Symbiodinium strain growing in culture vs. in hospite, in this strain after exposure to various stressors, and in different Symbiodinium strains grown in this same host, as well as to make informative comparisons to the genomic and transcriptomic sequences that are currently becoming available for other Symbiodinium types (Bayer et al. 2012; Shoguchi et al. 2013) .",

Because mammalian GLUT8 is localized to the endosome membrane (Augustin et al. 2005) , it is likely that one or both of the Aiptasia GLUT8 orthologs localize to the symbiosome membrane ( Figure 7A ), a hypothesis that should be readily testable by immunolocalization studies once appropriate antibodies are available. The putative Na + -glucose/myo-inositol co-transporter might also be involved in glucose transport across the symbiosome membrane. It should be noted that there must also be a Symbiodinium protein that transports large amounts of glucose into the symbiosome lumen ( Figure 7B) ; it should be possible to identify the corresponding gene(s) among those expressed differentially in Symbiodinium cells growing in hospite relative to those growing in culture.",

Nourishment of the epidermal cells is a major issue because these cells neither contain dinoflagellates nor have direct access to food, but they presumably require large amounts of energy for maintenance, reproduction, nematocyst replacement, and mucus production [which is extensive and has been reported to consume as much as 40% of the energy available to corals (Crossland et al. 1980) ]. Thus, one or more of the upregulated glucose transporters might be found in the basolateral membranes of the gastrodermal cells ( Figure 7, C and D) , the basolateral membranes of the epidermal cells ( Figure 7E ), or both.

Thus, it is conceivable that the upregulation of genes encoding proteins of fatty-acid metabolism and transport reflects a significant role of fatty acids in this transfer ( Figure 7F ). Importantly, however, (1) we saw upregulation of genes of both fattyacid synthesis and fatty-acid breakdown (suggesting that gastrodermal and epidermal cells may be behaving differently) and (2) in most animals, high levels of glucose (such as those expected in the cytoplasm of gastrodermal cells harboring dinoflagellates) inhibit b-oxidation and stimulate fatty-acid synthesis (Randle 1998) . Thus, we think it more likely that gastrodermal cells synthesize fatty acids from the glucose provided by the dinoflagellates during the day ( Figure 7G ), store them in neutral fats or wax esters (Crossland et al. 1980; Harland et al. 1993) , and subsequently mobilize them to serve as an energy supply at night and/or for transfer into the mesoglea ( Figure 7H ) and thence into the epidermal cells ( Figure 7I ). The epidermal cells would metabolize the fatty acids by b-oxidation ( Figure 7J ) to provide energy and acetyl-CoA building blocks. The apparent upregulation of the glyoxylate cycle (Figure 7K ) (see Results) would be explained by the need of the epidermal cells to synthesize carbohydrates, amino acids, and other compounds from acetyl-CoA. Testing of these hypotheses should be possible by immunolocalization of the relevant proteins, in situ mRNA hybridization, and/or examination of gene expression in separated gastrodermal and epidermal tissue layers.",

We have confirmed and extended these findings by showing that Aiptasia and several other cnidarians also contain multiple genes encoding Npc2-like proteins. In a phylogenetic analysis, one of the Aiptasia proteins clustered with the mammalian and Drosophila proteins and shares with them key residues implicated in cholesterol binding. Four other Aiptasia proteins, including the one whose transcript is massively upregulated in symbiotic anemones (Npc2D), belong to a separate subfamily that also contains the upregulated A. viridis Npc2D; members of this subfamily do not share the residues implicated in cholesterol binding ( Figure 2B) . In contrast, we identified only one Aiptasia gene encoding an unequivocal Npc1-like protein; its expression did not change between aposymbiotic and symbiotic animals. These observations suggest the following speculative model ( Figure 7L) . A Symbiodinium-encoded sterol transporter (e.g., an Npc1-like protein) is present in the dinoflagellate plasma membrane and passes one or more dinoflagellate-synthesized sterols to the Aiptasia-encoded Npc2D, which is localized specifically to the symbiosome lumen. Npc2D in turn passes the sterol(s) to the Aiptasiaencoded Npc1 in the symbiosome membrane, which passes them to a sterol-carrier protein in the cytosol. If the same Npc1 protein functions in different membranes, in concert with all of the different Npc2 partners, and in other cell types as well as gastrodermal cells containing dinoflagellates, then this could explain why its transcript is not significantly upregulated upon the onset of symbiosis.",

The membranes of Aiptasia, like those of other animals, presumably contain cholesterol as an essential component. This cholesterol could be obtained from food, by de novo synthesis, or by modification of one or more of the distinctive, non-cholesterol sterols (dinosterol, gorgosterols) produced in large quantities by many dinoflagellates (but not by other marine algae that have been investigated) (Giner and Wikfors 2011) . Based on its sequence ( Figure 2B) , Aiptasia Npc2A seems the most likely to be involved in cholesterol traffic per se, whereas Npc2D (and Npc2B, Npc2C, and Npc2E: Figure 2A ) might all be involved in traffic of various other dinoflagellate-produced sterols. The latter might serve only as precursors of cholesterol, but a more intriguing possibility is that one or more of these molecules serves as the signal that a symbiosis-compatible dinoflagellate is present in the phagosome/symbiosome.",

Thus, at least some of the many inorganic-nutrient transporters and transport-related proteins that are upregulated in symbiotic anemones (see Results) are presumably localized to the symbiosome membrane or lumen ( Figure 7M ). However, it seems virtually certain that the onset of symbiosis also induces changes in inorganic-nutrient transport across the various plasma-membrane domains. For example, aposymbiotic anemones presumably excrete CO 2 and NH 4 + across the apical membranes of both epidermal and gastrodermal cells, whereas symbiotic anemones presumably reduce such excretion at least from the gastrodermal cells, and may even achieve a net uptake of both compounds from the environment. Although the possibilities are too numerous and too complicated for ready depiction in Figure 7 , determining the cellular (gastrodermal, epidermal, or both) and intracellular (symbiosome membrane, apical plasma membrane, basolateral plasma membrane, and/or other) localizations of the differentially regulated transporters and transport-related proteins should begin to answer many of these questions with a clarity that has not been possible before.",

                "text": "The changes in NH + movement upon symbiosis establishment also bear on the probable linkage between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In this regard, two non-mutually exclusive models have been put forward. The \"nitrogen-recycling model\" focuses on the possibility that continued host catabolism of amino acids produces NH 4 + that is supplied to the dinoflagellate, which in turn releases amino acids for use by the host (Figure 7N ) (Cates and McLaughlin 1976; Szmant-Froelich and Pilson 1977; Wang and Douglas 1998) . In contrast, the \"nitrogen-conservation model\" focuses on the possibility that the fixed carbon provided by the dinoflagellate leads to a suppression of host amino-acid catabolism and therefore of the generation of NH + to be used by the dinoflagellate or excreted (Rees 1986; Rees and Ellard 1989; Wang and Douglas 1998) . Our data provide support for aspects of both models. In particular, we observed upregulation of the genes of the GS-GOGAT cycle (the first dedicated step of NH 4 + assimilation in animals) in symbiotic anemones, indicating that the release of metabolites from the dinoflagellate promoted synthesis, rather than catabolism, of some amino acids. ( \u00c3 The simultaneous upregulation of a presumably catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase might be taken as countervailing evidence, but this observation is difficult to interpret without knowing in which cell type(s) and cytoplasmic compartment(s) this upregulation occurs.) Meanwhile, we also obtained strong support for previous evidence that cnidarians, like other animals, can only synthesize eight of the 20 amino acids found in proteins from intermediates of the central metabolic pathways. The remaining 12 amino acids must thus be obtained either from food or from the dinoflagellates, and our observation that the host genes for at least nine amino-acid transporters are upregulated in symbiotic anemones (see Results) suggests strongly that the dinoflagellates indeed contribute to the host'samino acid supply. It should be informative to determine the localizations and amino-acid specificities of these host-encoded transporters as well as to identify any amino-acid transporters expressed differentially by Symbiodinium during growth in hospite (because it is unlikely that free-living dinoflagellates would export amino acids into the surrounding sea water).",

                "text": "Response to oxidative stress: Both a priori logic and considerable experimental evidence support the view that possession of an intracellular photosynthetic symbiont imposes oxidative stress on the host, particularly under conditions in which chloroplast damage may result in enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (D'Aoust et al. 1976; Lesser 1997 Lesser , 2006 Venn et al. 2008) . If not detoxified, ROS can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids (Lesser 2006) , and it is widely believed that ROS production under stress is the major trigger of symbiosis breakdown during bleaching (Lesser 1997 (Lesser , 2006 (Lesser , 2011 Jones et al. 1998; Downs et al. 2002; Venn et al. 2008; Weis 2008) . Surprisingly, however, our results provide no support for these views. Although a catalase gene is expressed at high levels in symbiotic anemones (Sunagawa et al. 2009 , and see the RNA-Seq read counts provided in File S2 and File S3), as it is in other animals (Kodzius et al. 2004) , both it and most of the other differentially regulated genes in this GO category were actually downregulated in symbiotic animals, and the two that were upregulated do not seem likely to be involved in ROS detoxification (see Results). Previous studies of other species of anemones have also found host genes thought to be involved in ROS detoxification (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase) to be downregulated in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic individuals (Rodriguez-Lanetty et al. 2006; Ganot et al. 2011) . Although other studies have indicated that symbiotic cnidarians have higher superoxide-dismutase activities than their aposymbiotic counterparts (Dykens and Shick 1982; Furla et al. 2005) , it was not determined whether the enzyme was of host or dinoflagellate origin. Thus, it is possible that the hosts are protected from ROS by symbiont-generated antioxidants and can reduce the expression of their own enzymes (Rodriguez-Lanetty et al. 2006) . These other studies, like ours, were conducted under conditions thought to be nonstressful, and it is possible that a different picture would emerge under stressful conditions. In that regard, however, we have also recently observed that bleaching under heat stress can occur rapidly in the dark, when photosynthetically produced ROS cannot be present (Tolleter et al. 2013) .",

In invertebrates, including anthozoans, the inflammation-like response involves both cellular and humoral aspects, including the infiltration of immune cells such as amoebocytes and granular cells (Patterson and Landolt 1979; Mydlarz et al. 2008; Palmer et al. 2008) , phagocytosis and/or encapsulation of foreign material (Patterson and Landolt 1979; Olano and Bigger 2000; Petes et al. 2003; Mydlarz et al. 2008) , and the production of cytotoxic molecules such as ROS, nitric oxide, lysozyme, antimicrobial peptides, and intermediates of the phenoloxidase cascade (Hutton and Smith 1996; Perez and Weis 2006; Mydlarz et al. 2008; Palmer et al. 2008) . Our data suggest that the establishment of symbiosis is associated with an overall attenuation of the inflammatory response (see Results), presumably to allow the dinoflagellate to coexist peacefully with the host rather than being attacked as a harmful invader. Other studies also support this conclusion and suggest that it may be a general feature of the means by which animal hosts accommodate symbiotic microbes. For example, when symbiotic and aposymbiotic Aiptasia were challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the former produced much less nitric oxide than did the latter (Detournay et al. 2012) , and in two hard-coral species with inflammatory-like responses, dinoflagellate densities were lower in the \"inflamed\" than in the adjacent healthy tissues (Palmer et al. 2008) . Similarly, successful colonization of squid light organs by symbiotic bacteria is associated with an irreversible attenuation of host nitric-oxide production (Davidson et al. 2004; Altura et al. 2011) .",

SRB1 is a member of the CD36 protein family and is a transmembrane cell-surface glycoprotein that has been implicated in multiple functions, including lipid transport (Figure 2 , Table 7 , and associated text), cell adhesion, wound healing, apoptosis, and innate immunity (Areschoug and Gordon 2009) . Perhaps of most interest is its role in Plasmodium infection, because the apicomplexan parasites are a sister taxon to the dinoflagellates (Baldauf 2003) . SRB1 has been shown to boost host hepatocyte permissiveness to Plasmodium infection, promote parasite development by acting as major lipid provider, and enable adhesion between Plasmodium-infected and uninfected erythrocytes, thus allowing for movement of parasites between host cells (Adams et al. 2005; Rodrigues et al. 2008; Yalaoui et al. 2008) . It is possible that SRB1 has similar functions in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, and further investigation of its function by protein localization and knockdown of function should be highly informative.",

However, the possible role of apoptosis in maintenance of a stable symbiotic relationship has not been addressed experimentally. Others have suggested that apoptosis might contribute to the dynamic equilibrium between host and symbiont cell growth and proliferation that is presumably necessary to ensure a stable relationship (Muscatine and Pool 1979; Fitt 2000; Davy et al. 2012) , and our observation that 13 apoptosis/cell death-related genes were differentially expressed (some massively so) in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic anemones is broadly consistent with this possibility. However, the complexity of the apoptotic pathways and the fact that a single protein can have either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic function depending on its localization and/or the presence or absence of other specific signals makes it impossible to draw firm conclusions from gene expression data alone.",

These proteins are capable of inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis by at least two different pathways (Zhang et al. 1999; Sinha and Chaudhary 2004; Burkly et al. 2007; Sabour Alaoui et al. 2012) , as well as of activating the multifunctional NFkB and MAPK pathways (Sinha and Chaudhary 2004; Burkly et al. 2007) , so that they may coordinate multiple biological processes to regulate symbiotic stability. Interestingly, genes encoding TNF receptors and receptor-associated proteins were also prominent among the genes found to be upregulated in corals living under chronic mild heat stress (Barshis et al. 2013) .",

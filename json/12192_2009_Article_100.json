    "abstract": "The effect of increased light intensity and heat stress on heat shock protein Hsp60 was examined in two coral species using a branched coral and a laminar coral, selected for their different resistance to environmental perturbation. Transient Hsp60 induction was observed in the laminar coral following either light or thermal stress. Sustained induction was observed when these stresses were combined. The branched coral exhibited comparatively weak transient Hsp60 induction after heat stress and no detectable induction following light stress, consistent with its susceptibility to bleaching in native environments compared to the laminar coral. Our observations also demonstrate that increased light intensity and heat stress exhibited a greater negative impact on the photosynthetic capacity of environmentally sensitive branched coral than the more resistant laminar coral. This supports a correlation between stress induction of Hsp60 and (a) ability to counter perturbation of photosynthetic capacity by light and heat stress and (b) resistance to environmentally induced coral bleaching.",

Coral bleaching, which results in massive death of coral beds, is currently a major international concern. This phenomenon can be triggered by a range of environmental conditions (Brown 1997) . Among the different causes of coral bleaching, thermal stress from global warming and the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is thought to be a likely major contributor to coral damage (Brown 1997; Stone et al. 1999; Bruno et al. 2001) . The most widespread coral bleaching incidence has been associated with thermal stress of corals by ENSO that resulted in an increase in seawater temperature over a broad geographic area (McPhaden 1999; Saxby et al. 2003) .",

Investigations of Hsps in most organisms have not examined increased light intensity as a stressful stimulus, whereas there have been frequent studies on the effect of temperature elevation. However, bright light has been shown to be a damaging agent in the rat retina, and prior whole body hyperthermia and intravitreal injection of Hsp70 confer protection against light damage of the retina (Barbe et al. 1988; Yu et al. 2001) . The observation that light intensity affects the health of coral beds (Hoegh-Guldberg and Smith 1989; Lesser and Farrell 2004) and a recent report demonstrating the effect of light on heat shock protein Hsp60 homologs in cyanobacteria (Kojima and Nakamoto 2007) influenced the design of our present coral investigation that focuses on Hsp60 and includes, as stressful conditions, both light stress and elevation of water temperature.",

Transient Hsp60 induction was also observed after an increase in light intensity alone. In contrast to the transient nature of induction triggered by a single stress, the combination of heat and light stresses induced a sustained expression of Hsp60 at 48 h in Tur. A very different response was observed for the branched coral (Sty). A weak Hsp60 induction was noted in Sty at 24 h after temperature elevation, but no detectable induction was apparent after light stress (Fig. 1) . Following the combined stress of heat plus light, a weak signal was detected in Sty at 24 h but not at 48 h. These observations were substantiated using a second antibody specific for Hsp60 (SPA-805 from StressGen as listed in \"Materials and methods\"; data not shown). The two coral species were specifically selected because they exhibit marked differences in their ability to survive stressful conditions in the natural environment, with the laminar coral (Tur) being more resistant to environmental perturbations than the branched coral (Sty; Riegl and Velimirov 1991; Loya et al. 2001 ).",

Major differences in Hsp60 inducibility are apparent in the two coral species, selected for their different tolerances to environmental perturbation. The laminar coral demonstrated a robust transient induction of Hsp60 in response to both light and heat stress in contrast to the branched coral. This observation is consistent with the relative susceptibility of branched coral to bleaching triggered by environmental conditions resulting in the massive death of coral beds of this species (Riegl and Velimirov 1991; Loya et al. 2001) . Our observations also demonstrate that increased light intensity and heat stress exhibited a greater negative impact on the photosynthetic capacity of environmentally sensitive branched coral than the more resistant laminar coral. Interestingly, an Hsp60 homolog has been proposed to protect photosynthetic apparatus from thermal denaturation through association with Rubisco activase (Salvucci 2008) .",

Sublethal light stress encountered at midday periods of peak light intensity could trigger Hsp60 synthesis in the laminar coral and protect it from adverse environmental conditions, whereas lack of Hsp60 induction in the branched coral could render it more sensitive to damage. We suggest that Hsp60 induction levels could be a potential indicator of resistance to stress-induced coral bleaching in diverse coral species. The mechanism of resistance may or may not involve the classical heat shock response and cytoprotection in the form of thermotolerance. Hsp60 could protect the photosynthetic machinery using a different mechanism other than thermotolerance.",

Both organisms are classified as Cnidarians. We identified interesting features of Cnidarian Hsp60 by comparing amino acid sequence of Hsp60 homologs. The Ala amino acid insertion in the apical domain of sea anemone Hsp60 is particularly interesting.

The higher number of C-terminal Gly-Gly-Met repeats observed for sea anemone Hsp60 is intriguing. The structure and function of this motif is not fully elucidated (Gupta 1995; Sanchez et al. 1999) ; however, it could potentially alter the internal cavity of the GroEL heptameric ring at the level of the equatorial domain (Saibil et al. 1993; Thiyagarajan et al. 1996) . We also note the replacement of a conserved Tyr by His in one of the eight essential hydrophobic amino acids involved in polypeptide binding in sea anemone Hsp60. Although the physiological significance and potential benefits of these sequence variations in Cnidarian Hsp60 are not fully understood, changes in these critical domains could potentially affect the regulation and hence kinetics of Hsp60-mediated protein folding in corals.",

The three major domains of GroEL are the equatorial domain (yellow boxes with solid triangle, alignment positions 1-189 and 421-590), the hinge domain (pink boxes with solid squares, alignment positions 190-224 and 410-420), and the apical domain (dark green box with solid circle, alignment positions 226-408). The two red boxes correspond to GroEL amino acids R452 (asterisk, alignment position 487) and E461 (number sign, alignment position 496) that take part in salt-bridge formation, which stabilizes the double-ring structure in GroEL. The six blue boxes (open circle, within alignment position 233 to 298) represent the eight hydrophobic amino acids that are required for the binding of the unfolded polypeptide to the interior wall of the cavity created by the GroEL-GroES complex. The insertion of a small amino acid at alignment position 339 is shown using a cyan box (open triangle, alignment positions 338-340; Gly insertion in human, Ala insertion in sea anemone).

    "abstract": "Giant clams are one of the most important animals in coral reef ecosystem, and its growth and reproduction are being threatened by heat stress due to global warming. In the present study, the symbiont density, the crucial enzyme activities and the transcriptome were investigated in the outer mantle of giant clam Tridacna crocea after the acute exposure of high temperature. The density of symbiotic zooxanthellae decreased significantly during 12-24 h, with the minimum level (7.75 \u00d7 10 5 cell cm \u22122 , p < 0.05) at 12 h after heat stress. The activities of superoxide dismutase in the heat stress group was significantly lower than that in the control group at 24 h after heat stress, while no significant change in the activities of catalase was observed during the entire stress process. The activation level of caspase3 began to increase significantly at 12 h (1.22-fold, p < 0.05), and reached the highest level at 24 h (1.38-fold, p < 0.05) after heat stress. Six paired-end libraries were sequenced in two groups, including the heat stress and control group at 12 h after heat stress. Through the assembling of 187,116,632 paired-end reads with lengths of 2 \u00d7 150 bp, a total of 26,676 genes were obtained which derived from giant clam. Bioinformatics analysis revealed 47 significantly upregulated and 88 significantly downregulated genes at 12 h after the treatment. There were 12 overrepresented GO terms for significantly upregulated genes, mostly related to unfolded protein binding and ATP binding, whereas no GO term was overrepresented for significantly downregulated genes. These results collectively suggest high temperature could induce excessive oxidative stress through the repressed antioxidant ability, the apoptosis activated by the unfolded protein response, and further the collapse of the symbiosis between host and symbiont, which has been threatening the growth and reproduction of the giant clam T. crocea.",

The elaborately symbiosis endows giant clams with the successful adaptation to well-lit and oligotrophic waters in coral reef ecosystem. Unlike the intracellular symbiosis in stony corals, symbiotic zooxanthellae reside extracellularly inside a tubular system permeating the outer mantle of giant clams [2] . The symbionts provide giant clams with nutrients through photosynthesis, which can constitute up to 100% of the host's energy requirements [3] . In exchange, giant clams provide the symbionts with essential nutrients such as inorganic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in support of their metabolism and growth [4] .",

The shells of giant clams can provide substrate for epibionts and contribute to the complexity of the coral reef structure, while their mantle cavities harbour substantial commensal and ectoparasitic organisms [10, 11] . Furthermore, giant clams can expel Symbiodinium, faeces and gametes to feed other organisms in the coral reef ecosystem [9] . Because the shifts of the mean annual sea surface temperature due to global warming have caused the outbreak of coral bleaching that increase both in frequency and severity, coral reef ecosystem has also been degrading over the past three decades [12] . The destruction of environmental condition in coral reef ecosystem has threaten the growth and reproduction of giant clams [13] , and therefore their conservation, reproduction and adaptation have been paid more attentions for the restoration and protection of coral reef ecosystem [14] .",

It has been observed that the exposure to increased water temperature could cause significant respiration increase with a high photosynthetic rate in giant clam Tridacna squamosa [15] , and induce the change of fatty acid diversity and the expression upregulation of genes involved in lipids in giant clam Tridacna maxima [16] . Heat stress in combination with an irradiance increase has been reported to cause the loss of symbiont, the retention of small symbiont and the chlorophyll content decrease of remaining symbiont in giant clam Tridacna gigas, which further resulted in the collapse of the clamzooxanthella symbiosis, and finally the bleaching of giant clam [17] . Furthermore, it has also been considered that heat stress could lead to two sequential cell death processes for the symbionts in giant clam Tridacna maxima [16] , and total mortality of trochophores in giant clam Tridacna squamosal [18] [19] [20] . These studies have described the responses of giant clam to heat stress in the morphology and metabolism level, however, the detailed physiological mechanism underlying the heat stress response of giant clam and their bleaching remains unclear.",

The giant clam has been reported to suffer from the serious bleaching and even death, and this mass bleaching accompanied with high sea surface temperatures [17] . To understand systemically the potential effects of high temperature on the physiology and symbiosis of giant clam, the symbiotic zooxanthella density, the crucial enzyme activities and the metatranscriptome were investigated in the giant clam T. crocea after the acute exposure to high temperature. The present study would provide insights to further understand the physiological mechanisms underlying heat stress response of giant clam and its potential environmental adaptability.",

High temperature is one of the most important factors for the bleaching of giant clam, which has threatened its survival and reproduction [31] . The bleaching is also caused by the collapse of the symbiosis between giant clam and zooxanthella, and characterized by the subsequent loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae [32] . In the present study, the change in the density of symbiotic zooxanthellae was determined in the outer mantle of the giant clam T. crocea to illustrate the effect of high temperature on the symbiosis of giant clam and zooxanthella. The symbiont density decreased significantly after heat stress, compared by those in the blank and control groups. It revealed that the heat stress could cause the decline of symbiont density in the outer mantle of the giant clam, demonstrating that the balance of clam-zooxanthella symbiosis could be disrupted by heat stress. The symbiosis collapse was similar with the observation in stony coral [33, 34] . It was reported that when the temperature exceeds a certain degree, the enzymes participating in photosynthetic reaction will cease functioning, which can result in a lack of available oxygen and the accumulation of waste products in the mantle. The clam then would respond by expulsing the zooxanthellae from its tissue so as to reduce its metabolism [35, 36] . In addition to this, it might also result from excessive oxidative stress during heat stress, which was supported by the recent report that the expressions of genes involved in ROS pathways were upregulated in giant clam T. maxima under high temperature [16] . The excessive oxidative stress would result in the expulsion of symbiotic zooxanthellae from the outer mantle of the giant clam. The rest of symbionts might not produce enough nutrient substances containing energies to meet the demand of the host, which would threat the growth and reproduction of the giant clam T. crocea.",

Both SOD and CAT are main antioxidases in the redox system, and catalyze the deoxidation of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Results showed that the SOD activity at 24 h after heat stress was significantly lower than that in the control group, while no significant change in the CAT activities was observed during the entire stress process. It demonstrated that the SOD and CAT activities did not increase significantly in the giant clam T. crocea after heat stress. However, it was inconsistent with the previous observations where the expressions of antioxidase genes were upregulated in giant clam Tridacna maxima after heat stress [16] . The disparity in the observations could result from the differences in seawater temperature used and the sampling time, since the upregulated expression was observed between 3 and 13 days after heat stress (29\u00b0C). The present results revealed that the antioxidant ability could be repressed in the outer mantle of the giant clam during the early stage of heat stress (32\u00b0C). Environmental stressors generally induce the level of reactive oxygen species through respiratory burst in the internal environment of the organism. Therefore, the repression of antioxidant ability implied that there was excessive oxidative stress in the outer mantle after heat stress, which could also be supported by the overrepresented GO terms related to unfolded protein binding in the transcriptome analyses. Furthermore, the unfolded protein response might be activated, similar with the observation of the heat stress response in mollusc Mytilus galloprovincialis and Laternula elliptica [37, 38] .",

GO overrepresentation analyses of these differentially expressed genes were conducted to further understand the transcriptional change of the giant clam after heat stress.

It demonstrated that acute heat stress could induce the production of unfolded protein and the utilization of ATP in the giant clam T. crocea. The emergence of unfolded proteins could result from the massive oxygen free radicals produced by the respiratory burst under environmental stress, such as elevated temperatures [44, 45] . In general, molecular chaperones such as heat shock proteins can bind to the unfolded or misfolded proteins, and help these proteins regain nature conformation and recovery of its biological activity with the energy supply from ATP [46] . Therefore, some GO terms related with ATP binding were also overrepresented for the significantly upregulated genes in the present study, further revealing that the repair mechanism of unfolded proteins was activated in the giant clam T. crocea after heat stress. Furthermore, no overrepresented GO term was observed for significantly downregulated clam genes at 12 h after heat stress.

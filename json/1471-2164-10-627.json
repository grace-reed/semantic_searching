    "abstract": "Background: Coral reefs are expected to be severely impacted by rising seawater temperatures associated with climate change. This study used cDNA microarrays to investigate transcriptional effects of thermal stress in embryos of the coral Montastraea faveolata. Embryos were exposed to 27.5\u00b0C, 29.0\u00b0C, and 31.5\u00b0C directly after fertilization. Differences in gene expression were measured after 12 and 48 hours. Results: Analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated that increased temperatures may lead to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and a structural reconfiguration of the cytoskeletal network. Metabolic processes were downregulated, and the action of histones and zinc finger-containing proteins may have played a role in the long-term regulation upon heat stress. Conclusions: Embryos responded differently depending on exposure time and temperature level. Embryos showed expression of stress-related genes already at a temperature of 29.0\u00b0C, but seemed to be able to counteract the initial response over time. By contrast, embryos at 31.5\u00b0C displayed continuous expression of stress genes. The genes that played a role in the response to elevated temperatures consisted of both highly conserved and coral-specific genes. These genes might serve as a basis for research into coral-specific adaptations to stress responses and global climate change.",

The optimum temperature for adult scleractinian corals is between 25\u00b0C and 29.0\u00b0C [1] . As climate change becomes an increasing threat to the biosphere, corals are among the first organisms to suffer from the consequences of global warming [2] . Heat stress in reef-building corals affects the coral hosts and their algal symbionts, but the relative sensitivity of both to thermal stress is uncertain [3] . The first visual sign of heat stress to the coral holobiont (i.e. host, symbionts, and associated microorganisms) is bleaching, i.e. the loss of photosynthetic symbionts [4] .",

From a molecular and genetic perspective, coral embryos/larvae represent an interesting system, as many species initially lack endosymbionts. Hence, it is possible to measure the effect of temperature on corals without the confounding factor of symbionts and their different physiologies. Studies on coral larvae show that increasing temperatures affect fertilization, embryogenesis, development, survival, and settlement [15, 16] . However, molecular studies that assess transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression upon increasing temperatures in coral embryos and larvae have not yet been published.",

Transcriptomic changes were assayed with microarrays at 12 and 48 hours after fertilization. Based on our analysis of differentially expressed genes we devised a model that proposes that genes that play a role in system perturbation, system maintenance, and system regulation are affected upon heat stress. This study is the first transcriptome-wide analysis of heat stress in coral embryos and our data provide first insights into the relevant genes and adaptive capabilities of coral embryos in light of projected increases in seawater temperatures.",

Albeit offset by 4 and 2.5 hours to the samples on the microarray, the developmental stages of these embryos should reflect the embryos that were used for microarray analysis. We were not able to identify developmental differences based on larval morphology in regard to the different temperatures. However, tools for external classification of developmental stages are limited. Hence, changes in development probably exist that are not detected morphologically, but confound gene expression nevertheless. Studies have shown that some coral species do show faster development upon increasing temperatures, whereas others do not [15, 16] .",

[15] observed an increase in frequency of abnormalities in embryos of Acropora millepora when exposed to temperatures of 32\u00b0C or higher, but in our case the number of misshapen embryos was not consistent with an increase in temperature. However, proper larval development is critical for larval settlement, which in turn is required for individuals to be incorporated into a population. We have not followed up development of larvae until settlement, but the number of misshapen embryos indicates that it is a confounding factor to gene expression measurements. ",

For embryos kept at 31.5\u00b0C, we identified 218 differentially expressed genes after 12 hours, and 285 after 48 hours (Additional File 1). Genes were defined as up-or downregulated in regard to the expression of that gene in the 27.5\u00b0C temperature sample. Please note that the fertilization temperature was 30\u00b0C, and thus higher than two of the experimental temperatures (27.5\u00b0C and 29.0\u00b0C) and lower than the third (31.5\u00b0C). Gene expression might be partially affected by this circumstance as larvae at 27.5\u00b0C and 29\u00b0C experienced a higher initial incubation temperature, and larvae at 31.5\u00b0C experienced a lower initial incubation temperature. This might especially affect the 12 hour time point as larvae were kept at the treatment temperatures for only 10 hours. Annotated differentially expressed genes were assorted manually into different categories depending on their function or process they are involved in (based on BLAST, HMMER, GO, and InterPro results). Genes were associated with the following categories: response to stress, response to oxidative stress, apoptosis, immune system, cytoskeleton, proliferation/growth/development, ribosomes/translation, degradation, metabolism, electron transport, transport, signalling, RNA, DNA, and regulation of transcription (Additional File 2). These categories were then assembled into the three main groups of (1) system perturbation, (2) system maintenance, and (3) system regulation. The system perturbation group contained all the genes that became differentially expressed as a direct consequence of temperature exposure, i.e. genes assorted to a response to stress, a response to oxidative stress, apoptosis, cytoskeleton, and the immune system. Genes that were assorted to cytoskeleton, proliferation/ growth/development, ribosomes/translation, degradation, metabolism, electron transport, and transport were united into the group system maintenance. This group contained all those genes that play roles in housekeeping processes or processes related to continuation of the biology of a cell. All genes that were assorted to signaling, RNA, DNA, and regulation of transcription were referenced in the group system regulation as these proteins play roles in regulatory processes in a cell.",

This could be due to a maximum temperature increase of up to 31.5\u00b0C. Most studies on proteins have not reported the expression of heat shock proteins at temperatures lower than 33\u00b0C [5, 8] . In addition, our arrays contained only homologs of a 90-kda heat shock protein (HSP90) (AOSF1451) and a 97 kDa heat shock protein (CAOO2018). Both genes displayed higher expression in embryos kept at 31.5\u00b0C after 12 hours, but not significantly so (data not shown). We did, however, identify heat shock transcription factor 1 (CAON1605) to be upregulated after 12 hours at 31.5\u00b0C. Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) regulate the induction of many HSPs and other proteins [19, 20] . In particular, HSF1 has been indentified as the primary transcription factor responsible for the transcriptional response to heat stress in mammalian cells [21] . In addition, our set of differentially expressed genes indicated increased rates of protein misfolding, degradation, and DNA damage as stated in succeeding sections. Hence, we assume that the treatment temperatures applied were high enough to have structural effects on nucleic acids and proteins. This in turn suggests that both temperatures, 29.0\u00b0C and 31.5\u00b0C, are stressful, and that rather the buffering capacity of heat shock proteins was being compromised in this experiment.",

At both temperatures cytochrome p450 (CAON1879), soma ferritin (CAON1101), catalase (AOSF550), and peroxidasin-like protein (AOSF997) were upregulated as a consequence of exposure to increased temperatures. The upregulation of oxidative stress genes indicates that, as in adult corals, an increase in temperature leads to oxidative stress in coral embryos [11] . Whereas cytochrome p450, soma ferritin, and catalase displayed a similar change in expression at both temperatures, peroxidasin-like protein was highly upregulated (> 12-fold) in embryos exposed to 31.5\u00b0C. Peroxidasin is a supposedly multifunctional protein that plays a role in several biological processes such as oxidation reduction, removal of apoptotic cells, and cross-linking and stabilizing of the extracellular matrix [22] . We suggest that peroxidasin-like protein might provide a useful candidate as a coral heat stress biomarker for the following reasons: 1) Peroxidasin-like protein seems to be concordantly upregulated in embryos exposed for prolonged periods of time to elevated temperatures, 2) it showed a difference in upregulation depending on the temperature level that embryos were exposed to which gives rise to the possibility to not only assess current stress levels, but past stress levels, and 3) it has been shown to be upregulated upon heat stress in adult coral [6] . Further studies on peroxidasin-like protein with a higher number of samples and coral species must be conducted in order to yield insights into the identity and applicability of this protein as a heat stress biomarker.",

Downregulation of ribosomal proteins as a consequence of heat shock has been shown in Drosophila melanogaster and yeast [30, 31] . Most of the genes in the category degradation were ubiquitin-related genes. Protein degradation is considered a general consequence of heat stress as elevated temperatures lead to increased rates of misfolding. In accordance with our findings of a downregulation of protein biosynthesis (which would indicate a downregulation of overall metabolism), we found a stronger down-than upregulation of metabolism-related genes. We also found a downregulation of genes related to electron transport in oxidative phosphorylation that might further indicate that metabolism is downregulated.",

                "text": "Based on our analysis and assignment of annotated differentially expressed genes, we devised a model of heat stress in coral embryos (Figure 2 ). Upon temperature increase, cells respond with regulation of genes playing a role in system perturbation, system maintenance, and system regulation. Heat stress induces differential expression of stress-responsive genes. This in turn results in differential expression of genes involved in the response to oxidative stress as heat stress stimulates the production of ROS [37, 38] . High levels of oxidative stress in turn have been linked to programmed cell death pathways and cytoskeletal changes [39] . Furthermore, heat stress causes a general downregulation of metabolic processes in coral embryos. As a consequence, ribosome biosynthesis, metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated. These processes are all interconnected. Additionally, heat stress causes misfolding of proteins, which in turn affects the regulation of the protein degradation machinery. On an upstream level, Histone proteins regulate downstream gene expression, and zinc finger proteins might modify those in turn. Please note that this model is based on incomplete transcriptomic data and manual assortment of differentially expressed genes, and therefore subject to change. Furthermore, due to logistical constraints, we were not able to include true biological replicates. Ideally, three to five independent replicated cultures should have been analyzed per treatment and time point to evaluate the potentially contribution of so-called \"jar effects\" (i.e. the differences between supposedly identical cultures) into the observed gene expression variation. Although jar effects represent a problem for our analysis, we hope that most of the observed gene expression patterns represent the true response to the treatments, because 1) our results are in correspondence with results from other heat stress studies in other organisms, 2) we find a stronger stress response in larvae treated at higher temperatures, and 3) a similar study that we conducted with Acropora palmata larvae in which we did assay biological replicates gave similar results (data not shown). We therefore acknowledge that implications drawn from these data are limited and follow-up studies (e.g. qPCR) with proper biological replication are necessary to validate results and conclusions presented here. Future efforts should concentrate on comparing transcriptomic responses to different stressors in coral embryos in order to identify a set of common and specific key response genes. These key genes could then serve as a repository for stressor-specific biomarkers as well as for research into coral-specific adaptations to stress responses and global climate change.",

For this reason, we exposed our embryos to a more constant and gentle increase in water temperature rather than a short term heat shock. Despite the lack of biological replicates in this study, our data indicate that effects of temperature on coral embryos depend on the duration and the degree of temperature change. Embryos at 29.0\u00b0C are physiologically responsive and show expression of stress-related genes, but seem to be able to counteract the temperature situation over time. Embryos at 31.5\u00b0C, however, are not able to recover during prolonged exposure periods and continuously express stress-related genes.",

Subsequent embryonic and larval rearing and experimental procedures were carried out at the Unidad de Sistemas Arrecifales of the Instituto de Ciencias del Mar y Limnolog\u00eda (ICMYL) of the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM). Spawn collection and fertilization were carried out at 30.0\u00b0C, and followed previously published protocols [40, 41] . Two hours after eggs were fertilized, embryos were transferred into bins containing 5 \u03bcm filtered seawater (FSW) and were raised at 27.5\u00b0C, 29.0\u00b0C and 31.5\u00b0C. Our temperature exposure system is described in detail in [42] and controlled temperature to to \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C. Batch cultures of embryos for this work were contained in 500 mL plastic containers suspended in the temperature baths by a foam rack. Each container was seeded with ca. 5,000 embryos, and embryos for a given temperature were raised in three different containers. Water in the containers was changed twice per day with water that was preheated to the treatment temperature prior to use. Approximately 500 embryos from each of the three containers for a given temperature were sampled and combined after 12 and 48 hours. This gave rise to a single sample of 1,500 embryos for each temperature and time point that was used for subsequent RNA isolation. Each of these RNA isolations was used for 3 technical microarray replicates. Embryos were immediately transferred into RNAlater (Ambion), and incubated overnight in the refrigerator. Subsequently, soaked embryos were frozen at -80\u00b0C and returned to the laboratory for analysis. To examine the time course of development, approximately 100 embryos were sampled from each temperature every 4 to 12 hours along the developmental time course. Embryos were sampled from the 500 mL culture containers from the same embryo pool as the microarray samples. Embryos were fixed in 2% Glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer and kept at 4\u00b0C. The samples were then returned to the laboratory for microscopic examination to determine developmental stages. Experimental research followed internationally recognized guidelines according to CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), permit number: MX-HR-007-MEX. No ethical approval was required for any of the experimental research described here.",

Spotted cDNAs were chosen from EST libraries described in Schwarz et al.

All clones are accessible via our database at http://sequoia.ucmerced.edu/SymBioSys/ index.php.Total RNA of approximately 1,500 frozen coral embryos was isolated using Qiazol lysis reagent (QIA-GEN) according to manufacturer's instructions. Embryos were homogenized for 2 minutes using a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec) with 0.1 mm and 0.55 mm silica beads to break up cellular structures. RNA pellets were cleaned further with RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen). RNA quantity and integrity was assessed with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, respectively. For all experiments, 1 \u03bcg of total RNA was amplified using the MessageAmp II aRNA kit (Ambion). For cDNA synthesis, 3 \u03bcg of aRNA per sample were primed with 3.5 nmoles of random pentadecamers for 10 minutes at 70\u00b0C. Reverse transcription (RT) lasted for 2 hours at 50\u00b0C using a master mix containing a 4:1 ratio of aminoallyl-dUTP to TTP.

The hybridization mixtures were boiled for 2 minutes at 99\u00b0C, then allowed to cool at room temperature for 5 minutes. The cooled hybridization mixtures were pipetted under an mSeries Lifterslip (Erie Scientific), and hybridization took place in Corning hybridization chambers overnight at 63\u00b0C. Microarrays were washed twice in 0.6 \u00d7 SSC and 0.01% SDS followed by a rinse in 0.06 \u00d7 SSC and dried via centrifugation. Slides were immediately scanned using an Axon 4000B scanner.

Typically, they function in energy conversion, oxidizing substrate and using this reducing power to generate an electrochemical gradient that spans the inner mitochondrial membrane. Directly or indirectly, this gradient is used to perform the vast majority of work in the cell. An emerging consensus suggests that mitochondria, hydrogenosomes, and related organelles are vestiges of bacteria that became endosymbionts early in the history of eukaryotes [1, 2] . In such early eukaryotes, selection may have favored divergent traits in host and symbiont. Likely, selection favored symbionts that could manipulate their host cells to their own advantage [3] . For instance, releasing ATP to the host would result in a faster host replication rate, thus providing more habitat for the symbionts. Alternatively, releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the host might trigger sexual recombination and genetically novel host cells for the symbionts to inhabit.",

The role of mitochondria in patterns and processes of development can be similarly illuminated. The ancient synergisms and antagonisms between mitochondria and their hosts may underlie the release of metabolites or metabolic by-products that in turn trigger patterns of growth, differentiation, movement, and death in host cells. At the same time, there remain important functional consequences of such metabolic signaling, thus superimposing an ever-shifting selective milieu over these putative vestiges. The premise of this review is that modern studies of the role of mitochondria in development can illuminate both historical vestiges and current selective forces. Relatively simple and in some ways primitive animals such as cnidarians may be particularly useful in such investigations.",

Often, cnidarians alternate between a more-or-less sessile polyp stage and a swimming medusoid stage. In many cases, the polyp stage forms a colony; in such a colony, polyps are connected by a common gastrovascular system. Perhaps the best-known examples of such colonies are the reef-building corals, which are also notable because of their habitat of hosting symbiotic algae [4] .",

A favorite experiment of late-19th century biologists involved cutting the base of the stalk of the hydroid Tubularia and removing the hydranth (the mouth and tentacles) at the other end. This undifferentiated stalk could then serve as the basis for a variety of experiments. For instance, if one end was buried in sand, the other end invariably developed a hydranth, regardless of the original polarity. Various competing explanations for this and similar results were developed. Proponents of metabolic hypotheses suggested that the sand blocked the diffusion of oxygen to the buried end. A metabolic gradient thus formed and influenced the observed pattern of development. Alternatively, others suggested that a diffusible factor released from the stalk itself accumulated near the buried end and inhibited the development of a hydranth.",

Such experiments did stimulate further work on metabolic gradients in cnidarians and other organisms as well. Foremost among researchers studying these gradients was Charles Manning Child. Child and his long-time collaborator, Libby Henrietta Hyman, demonstrated gradients in the effects of metabolic poisons (e.g., cyanide) and in oxygen uptake (using Winkler titrations) in a number of cnidarians, e.g. [6] . Nevertheless, by the 1940s this work fell into disrepute and was largely abandoned by developmental biologists. While some attribute the demise of Child and his theories to the rise of genetics [7] , the still nascent understanding of mitochondrial bioenergetics was no doubt a contributing factor. Only in the 1960s and 1970s (e.g. [8] ) was a sufficient understanding of bioenergetics developed to allow firmly grounded experimental approaches to illuminate the actual effects of mitochondria on development. In the last decade, elaboration of the role of mitochondria in programmed cell death [1] has further diminished the skepticism of main-stream developmental biologists and further opened the door to broader considerations of the effects of mitochondria.",

                "text": "Indeed, the long-discredited views of Child and co-workers have a compelling rationale. Consider cnidarian polyps growing in the ocean. Such polyps are typically very long-lived. For instance, clones of hydra may be immortal [9] as may be anemones and corals [10] . In the laboratory, we have used a clone of the same hydroid colony for over 15 years of experiments [11] , and this is not uncommon [12] . So cnidarian polyps growing in the sea may persist for a very great while. Nevertheless, the environment certainly may vary. The polyp stage is typically sedentary, so responses to the environment must occur by growth and development or differentiation of some sort. What better signal than substrate or metabolic by-products, or both? In the case of a colony, for example, polyps that receive sufficient food can trigger greater development in these areas, while polyps that are underfed can suppress further development while nonetheless continuing to sample the same area lest it become more productive. Similar logic applies to solitary polyps which can either replicate clonally in the same area or initiate gamete production or a medusoid stage for dispersal and sexual reproduction. For instance, a solitary polyp in a rich habitat should rapidly replicate itself to take advantage of the favorable conditions. A polyp in a poor or stressful habitat, on the other hand, should initiate sex or dispersal, or both. In this way, escape from the poor or stressful habitat can be accomplished by physical dispersal or by producing novel genotypes that can better cope with the stress.",

In the case of mitochondria, substrate is oxidized and electrons are carried to the electron transport chain by cofactors such as NADH and FADH 2 ( Fig. 1 ). Oxidation of these cofactors leads to the sequential reduction of the electron carriers. Typically, diatomic oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor. However, if the electron carriers become highly reduced, some electrons may be diverted to oxygen before the final step of electron transport. This results in reactive oxygen species, broadly defined as partially reduced forms of oxygen (see [15] ). If both substrate and oxygen are plentiful, and there is metabolic demand from the cell and organism, the formation of ROS is maintained at moderate levels (\"state 3\"). If substrate is in short supply (starvation), ROS levels are minimal (\"state 2\"). If metabolic demand is low, ROS levels are maximal (\"state 4\"). Thus a signaling system based on mitochondrial ROS can effectively monitor and distinguish among these and other divergent environmental circumstances [16] .",

While these algae are clearly much more recent symbionts than mitochondria, and while their primary function is photosynthesis not respiration, metabolic signaling and metabolic signals (particu-larly ROS) nevertheless seen to be central to coral bleaching [4, 18] . Thus studies of bleaching require a broader understanding of the general patterns and processes of redox signaling in cnidarians. Here the logic of mitochondrial signaling is outlined in the context of the biology of both solitary and colonial polyps, and recent studies of such signaling, for the most part focused on ROS, are reviewed. Both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial ROS (including those from algal symbionts) are considered and integrated into the same framework. Finally, possible limitations of metabolic signaling are pointed out, and it is suggested that reliance on ROS in development may in some circumstances be subject to evolutionary constraints. In particular, host-symbiont signaling with algal ROS in anemones and corals may preclude extensive use of mitochondrial ROS in colony patterning. Conversely, utilization of mitochondrial ROS in patterning of colonial hydroids may preclude establishing algal symbiosis.",

Such favorable conditions could in part be indicated by mitochondrial redox state, e.g., state 3. Changing conditions can also be indicated by metabolic signaling, e.g., starvation (state 2) or little metabolic demand (state 4). As suggested above, in solitary polyps changing conditions typically trigger dispersal, sex, or both. Thus it would not be surprising to find that mitochondrial redox state regulates the transition between forming more polyps and forming sexual or dispersal stages. While studies of redox state have not been done in this context, there are some suggestive studies of the effects of ROS in solitary polyps.",

In Aurelia, the medusae form from the polyp stage by strobilation. During this process, the body of the polyp segments into several pieces with each one developing into a free-swimming medusa. As expected, environmental factors (temperature, light, and nutrition) are known to influence this process. Iodide ions seem to be necessary as well. In an important integrative synthesis, Berking et al. [21] show that in the polyps, metabolic ROS convert iodide into iodine, and it is the latter that triggers strobilation. Since mitochondria are the major source of such metabolic ROS [22] , it is reasonable to expect that they provide the ROS that oxidize iodide [21] . It might be that once a polyp ceases growing, metabolic demand diminishes and mitochondria enter state 4. High rates of ROS formation then ensue, and strobilation is triggered. If mitochondria are the source of the ROS, any number of experimental perturbations could be used to examine the effects of enhanced or diminished mitochondrial ROS [23] , and a corresponding effect on strobilation would be expected. While straightforward, such experiments have not yet been carried out.",

The various species and strains of Hydra include a variety of fresh-water polyps that entirely lack a medusoid stage. In response to environmental factors (e.g., temperature), Hydra will initiate gamete production directly. Shortly after zygote formation a resting stage is typically formed which is capable of over-wintering. Although little attention has been given to either metabolic signaling or the effects of ROS on the development of these organisms, there have been some suggestive findings. In normal polyps, activity of peroxidase, an enzyme that reduces hydrogen peroxide (a form of ROS) to water, strongly localizes to certain cells located in the \"foot\" or base of the animal. This association is sufficiently strong so that peroxidase activity can be used as a marker for tissue of this body region [24] . In Hydra, Jantzen et al. [25] noticed that lithium treatment resulted in expression of this characteristic peroxidase activity in various patches of tissue throughout the body column. They investigated whether this effect indicated a change in pattern formation (i.e., the upper parts of the polyp were becoming \"foot-like\") or alternatively a general up-regulation of anti-oxidant enzymes in response to lithium treatment. Their data suggest that peroxide may have a role in mediating the response of Hydra to lithium, although the nature of this mediation still remains unclear. Peroxide may affect signal transduction, or may trigger cell death thus inhibiting normal pattern formation, or both. The source of this peroxide is also not clear. While Jantzen et al. [25] used cyanide (which binds to complex IV, see Fig. 1 ) to inhibit the electron transport chain, such inhibition will often tend to enhance the production of mitochondrial ROS (because the electron carriers become highly reduced, i.e., inhibition mimics state 4). Thus the finding of cyanide insensitivity does not necessarily rule out a mitochondrial source for ROS.",

In turn, \u2424-catenin interacts with FOXO transcription factors, which are also regulated by insulin and oxidative-stress pathways [29] .

Yet the environmental circumstances under which a colony is growing can change relatively quickly even in seemingly homogenous tropical environments (e.g., following storms). Since cnidarians are typically carnivores, patterns of prey availability may be particularly important. As well, cnidarians that encrust surfaces may need to detect and integrate environmental signals that indicate when continued growth is favorable versus when resources should be allocated to gamete or medusa production (in parallel to the situation of solitary polyps). Metabolic signaling can successfully guide colonies in all of these circumstances. For instance, if the pattern of food availability shifts from one part of a colony to another, metabolic signals can be used to suppress growth and even trigger regression in the former area while stimulating growth in the latter area. Similarly, a growing colony will experience metabolic demand, shifting the redox state in the direction of oxidation (state 3). On the other hand, when the available surface is completely covered, metabolic demand will slow and the redox state will shift in the direction of reduction (state 4). Such signals could be used to trigger a shift in energy allocation from outward growth to, for instance, medusa production.",

In species of hydractiniid hydroids, workto-date suggests that the mitochondrion-rich region functions as a valve between the polyp and the rest of the colony (Fig. 3) . When mitochondrion-rich cells relax, the valve closes; when these cells contract, the valve opens. While during the feeding response the valve is closed, shortly after feeding the valve opens in concert with polyp contractions, and food is distributed throughout the colony by the gastrovascular fluid.

A number of studies [11, 23, 35, 36, [39] [40] [41] suggest the following view of how metabolic signaling can be integrated into adaptive colony development. Consider a colony encrusting Fig. 3 . Schematic of longitudinal section showing the hypothesized function of mitochondrion-rich cells in cnidarians. Successful feeding is followed by contractions of these cells (A). In concert with the musculature and hydrostatic skeleton of the polyp (above) and the rigid perisarc of the stolon (below), these contractions draw the band of tissue at the base tighter, opening the lumen, and allowing foodrich gastrovascular fluid to enter the stolon. When these mitochondrion-rich cells cease contracting (B), the tissue relaxes, closing the lumen. a hermit crab shell, a typical habitat for hydractiniid hydroids: given the vagaries of hermit crab behavior and resulting water currents, some polyps may feed while others do not. In areas of a colony that do not directly feed, polyps undergo minimal contractions, and there is little metabolic demand. Nevertheless, these areas of the colony are supplied with substrate via stolons from well-fed polyps. In unfed polyps there is thus sufficient substrate and little metabolic demand, and mitochondria (particularly those of mitochondrion-rich cells) enter the resting state (state 4). ROS emissions are maximal, and these ROS may suppress further local development of polyps and stolons. On the other hand, polyps in areas of the colony that are well fed contract maximally. Metabolic demand is maximal, and the redox state of mitochondria, particularly those in mitochondrion-rich cells, shifts in the direction of oxidation. ROS emissions are moderate and further development of polyps and stolons is no longer inhibited. Hence the colony develops in areas where food resources are most abundant.",

At the level of a cell, addition of substrate would typically shift the redox state in the direction of reduction. However, because feeding triggers gastrovascular flow [34] , in this system addition of substrate triggers contractions and metabolic demand in the mitochondrion-rich cells. The result is a shift of their redox state in the direction of oxidation, the opposite of simple, cell-level predictions. Regulation of redox state thus occurs at the level of the group of cells, and such regulation is influenced by the cells' grouplevel task. Since the observed response is distinct from that of single cells, this has been termed \"multicellular redox regulation\" [41, 42] .",

Typically, the mitochondrion-rich cells show the highest levels of ROS (Fig. 4) . Polyps also show moderate levels, while stolons are usually completely devoid of ROS with the exception of low levels near the tip (Fig. 5) . Nevertheless, if a colony experiences . Colony is growing on cover glass and is viewed from below with an inverted microscope. After the colony was treated with a nitric oxide donor and stained with H2DCFDA, the stolon tip produced high levels of reactive oxygen species and regressed. stress, colony-wide gastrovascular flow tends to diminish or cease. Depending on the severity of the stress and the extent to which gastrovascular flow is diminished, ROS and related reactive nitrogen species (RNS, e.g., nitric oxide) will then appear in some or all of the stolon tips (Fig. 5) . It is not known if the source of these ROS and RNS is mitochondrial. Subsequently, the affected stolon tips will regress [11] . This is a particular example of what seems to be generally found in cnidarians and other simple organisms as well. As described by Buss [43] : \"Clonal organisms typically possess one or more clonewide fluid-conducting systems. . .. The functioning of these systems will generate local patterns. . .. If such features can be detected and the signals transduced to effect expression of patternforming genes, global rules responsive to local state arise.\" ROS thus seem capable of inhibiting growth at moderate levels while actually triggering regression at still higher levels. Both cases, however, tend to result in adaptive growth and development: on the one hand, poor micro-habitats suppress proliferation of polyps, while on the other especially unfavorable habitats trigger active regression and centralized growth in the more favorable core area.",

Braverman treated colonies of a hydractiniid hydroid with carbon dioxide (the end product of aerobic oxidation of substrate) and found that a greater number of polyps developed medusae than in untreated controls. While Braverman argues for a direct effect, it is also possible that an increased concentration of CO 2 has a number of indirect effects (e.g., on pH and dissolved calcium). Thus CO 2 may actually trigger a more generalized stress response. However, earlier workers [30] and indeed Child himself devised a number of ingenious experiments that may argue against a general response. Other data suggest that gamete production may be enhanced by metabolites of the mitochondrial citrate cycle and that nutritive and reproductive polyps may have different enzymatic profiles from feeding polyps [46] . Thus a connection between metabolism and sexual development may exist in these hydroids, although further work is needed to clarify the nature of this connection.",

At the same time, these reefs provide vital ecosystem services to human society, including fisheries, coastal protection, building materials, new biochemical compounds, and tourism.

Many features of corals and anemones -absorption and concentration of inorganic carbon and various forms of nitrogen, tolerance to damaging sunlight, well-developed anti-oxidant defenses, and so on -facilitate and protect the symbionts [4] . The algae in turn provide the animal host with the products of photosynthesis. It is likely that the host and symbiont form an extensive web of metabolic interactions; bleaching may result from the partial or complete disruption of this web of metabolic signaling. Algae produce ROS which can contribute to photo-oxidative stress in the host [49, 50] . Anti-oxidant capabilities of the host likely developed in this context [4, [51] [52] [53] . At the same time, the host itself seems to produce high levels of RNS as a sort of \"eviction notice\" during the bleaching process [18] . Multiple mechanisms may thus be involved in bleaching culminating in host-cell detachment, expulsion through the host-cell membrane (exocytosis), digestion, and cell death [54] .",

Corals have been primarily studied in the field, although notable laboratory studies have also been done [55, 56] . Anemones, however, lack crucial features of corals: they are not colonial and thus do not have connections between polyps-a colonial gastrovascular system. Such a gastrovascular system may mediate bleaching by moving detached host cells and zooxanthellae released by exocytosis through and ultimately out of the colony [57] . The effects of temperature on a colonial gastrovascular system have been studied in hydractiniid hydroids [58] . Higher temperatures induce chaotic gastrovascular dynamics, and such dynamics may underlie bleaching episodes. Hydractiniid hydroids, however, lack algal symbionts and therefore do not bleach. Crucial studies of the gastrovascular system of corals have thus been hindered by the absence of a sufficiently tractable laboratory model.",

                "text": "Metabolic signals may under some circumstances lack specificity. Consider the lack of oxygen and the lack of metabolic demand: both will shift the redox state of mitochondria in the direction of reduction. The metabolic signals will thus be similar, even as the necessary responses are very different. While incorporating temporal dynamics into the signaling mechanism may provide a solution to this particular problem, the general point nevertheless remains. Consider for instance a cnidarian host subject to metabolic signaling from both mitochondria and algae. In some instances, the subcellular localization of ROS may help distinguish between the two sources. However, if the signaling occurs between mitochondrionrich cells and neighboring cells as described in Section 3, subcellular localization of the organelles would likely not provide effective discrimination. In such a case, there may be little possibility for a signaling mechanism that distinguishes ROS from mitochondria and ROS from algae. The use of the ROS in signaling from one of these sources may thus largely preclude the use of ROS from the other source. This may have served as a constraint in the evolution of both anthozoans (anemones and corals) and hydrozoans (including Hydra and the hydractiniid hydroids). Consider that representatives of the anthozoan sister group (the medusozoans, which include hydrozoans and scyphozoans) employ muscular activity both in the swimming of medusae [59] and in the circulation of gastrovascular fluid as described above in Section 3. While anthozoans certainly use muscles to retract, this may be a relatively simple activity compared to using co-ordinated colony-wide muscular contractions to propel gastrovascular fluid. Indeed, anthozoans typically exhibit cilia-driven gastrovascular flow [60] . Without a sophisticated nervous system, accomplishing muscle-driven flow may require mitochondrial signaling. Corals and anemones may not be able to do this, because their algal symbionts rely on the same metabolic pathways as mitochondria. Thus such host-symbiont signaling may have served as an important constraint in anthozoan evolution. At the same time, hydroids that use muscular contractions to drive gastrovascular flow may be precluded from establishing lasting symbioses with algae. Indeed, the best-known hydroids with photosynthetic symbionts are the \"green hydras.\" Since these are not colonial, they do not have sophisticated patterns of muscle-driven gastrovascular flow. While there are colonial hydroids with Symbiodinium symbionts [61] , the characteristics of the gastrovascular flow in these colonies remain unknown. Exploring metabolic signaling in such symbiotic colonial hydroids would provide an obvious test of this hypothesis.",

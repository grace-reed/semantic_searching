    "abstract": "Background: While studies of non-model organisms are critical for many research areas, such as evolution, development, and environmental biology, they present particular challenges for both experimental and computational genomic level research. Resources such as mass-produced microarrays and the computational tools linking these data to functional annotation at the system and pathway level are rarely available for non-model species. This type of \"systems-level\" analysis is critical to the understanding of patterns of gene expression that underlie biological processes. Results: We describe a bioinformatics pipeline known as FunnyBase that has been used to store, annotate, and analyze 40,363 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the heart and liver of the fish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Primary annotations based on sequence similarity are linked to networks of systematic annotation in Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and can be queried and computationally utilized in downstream analyses. Steps are taken to ensure that the annotation is self-consistent and that the structure of GO is used to identify higher level functions that may not be annotated directly. An integrated framework for cDNA library production, sequencing, quality control, expression data generation, and systems-level analysis is presented and utilized. In a case study, a set of genes, that had statistically significant regression between gene expression levels and environmental temperature along the Atlantic Coast, shows a statistically significant (P < 0.001) enrichment in genes associated with amine metabolism. Conclusion: The methods described have application for functional genomics studies, particularly among non-model organisms.

These and many other functional genomics studies rely on full genomic sequence to establish well-annotated databases. Yet, microarrays based on EST collections are increasingly being used for diverse species, from honey bees to fish [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] and including simple diploblastic organisms [21] . These studies within a diversity of organisms provide insights not provided by 'model' species (species that are genetically well defined or with annotated genomes [22] ). For example, 'non-model' organisms have provided insight into the natural variation in gene expression [23] , social castes among bees [24, 25] , hypoxia [26] , and physiological responses to variation in the thermal environment [27, 28] . To investigate adaptive variation in gene expression we use the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus (killifish) [23, 29] .",

Populations are large (>10,000) and affected by historical, demographic and selective constraints, providing a framework for the partitioning of variation in gene expression within and among populations. Additionally, the well-established phylogenetic relationship among Fundulus species can be used to discern adaptive changes [23, 33, 34] .

Currently, TIGR and NCBI provide gene indices for 28 and 23 animal species, respectively. Yet, there are 63 animal species with more than 10,000 ESTs [37] . The number of species with ESTs >10,000 has continued to grow, and there was approximately a 20% increase in the preceding three months. While annotation from these resources can be accessed through web-based homology searches, for many laboratory collections of ESTs it is difficult to use existing tools to achieve a systems-level view of gene functions and relationships. Rather than simply browsing functional information over the web for a different group's project, laboratories that produce novel EST collections and microarrays require customized databases providing access to integrated functional annotation as expression data are being analyzed.",

Perhaps ironically, the greatest challenge for functional annotation based on similarity searches is an overabundance of data. There are a number of databases to chose from, and often the single best hit from a given database search is not the most informative. FunnyBase implements a strategy to make maximum use of systems-level functional information from Gene Ontology (GO) [38] assignments and membership in metabolic pathways as defined by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [39] . Specifically, several sequence databases are queried and results integrated to maximize the number of annotated sequences.

High-throughput procedures are highly prone to tracking errors including: loading plates into an automatic sequencer in the wrong order, orienting symmetric plates in the wrong direction, or mislabeling of plates. The ability to identify these types of mistakes requires controls for identifying plates and plate orientation. The FunnyBase system has a number of integrated quality control steps. First, a Ctenophore cDNA (NCBI: accession number: CN992733) that is unlike anything else in GenBank is used as a control. Controls are placed in 96-well plates in wells corresponding to the plate number and two orientation wells (A5 and F9). Sequences from 96-well plates are automatically scanned for these controls so that the identity and orientation are confirmed and a report is generated for manual review. Secondly, all clones used for microarray production are re-sequenced. This is necessary because individual cDNAs are cherry picked, re-grown and re-amplified, and each of these steps has the potential to introduce or magnify an error. For example, for a 6,000 gene array, a 5% error rate would result in 300 incorrect clones. Re-sequenced array plates are compared using pair-wise BLAST [42] against previous sequencing results so that the identity of printed microarray spots are verified.",

This distribution is similar to other teleost fish EST collections (Fig 2) .

The increasing size of larger clusters with more sequencing efforts indicates that strategies to increase the probability of isolating new genes need to be employed. We used two strategies. First, we normalized the library to reduce the differences among expressed genes to less than 10-fold among rare and abundant mRNAs [44, 45] . Using this technique we were able to reduce redundancy in annotated genes from 33% in the non-normalized library to 11% after normalization. Second, we targeted specific sequences for subtraction: annotated cDNAs with high frequencies were targeted in order to focus effort on picking new, rare sequences. Through subtraction we were able to increase the rate of discovery of new annotatable sequences from 24% to 36%. However, analysis of these results indicate that a set of highly expressed sequences, some of which were not subtracted because they were not in the set of annotated genes, still make up much of the EST library and should be the focus of future subtractions.",

FunnyBase identifies the gene name associated with the 'best hit' BLAST result and then uses all GO annotation associated with hits from the complete BLAST results that have the same gene name as the 'best hit' and an e-value of e < 10 -12 . The goal of this approach is to identify annotation associated with a single 'best hit' gene based on results that may come from multiple species (orthologous genes) and therefore may have varying degrees of sequence similarity due to phylogenetic distance, but to avoid the problem of selecting an inconsistent set of GO terms arising from gene families that share regions of sequence similarity but may have different functions.",

Statistical analysis of this set of 363 metabolic genes identified a set of 62 genes that showed statistically significant regression between gene expression levels and temperature along the Atlantic coast. That is, among individuals collected from different locations along the thermocline and then acclimated to common physiological conditions for at least nine months before analysis, 17% of the metabolic genes had a linear relationship between the amount of mRNA and the environmental temperature these animals evolved in. Our hypothesis was that this set of 59 genes represents a functionally different set than those genes that do not show regression with temperature. To test this hypothesis we examined the frequency of genes annotated with a given GO term in the statistically significant gene set versus the non-significant genes. Figure 5 shows the relevant proportions in each set for GO terms that are represented by 5 or more ESTs in the significant set. For example, the GO term Amine Metabolism (GO:0009308) is assigned to 14% of the 62 statistically significant genes but only 3% of the non-significant genes (those that do not show significant regression with temperature). A Fisher-exact test indicates these frequencies (14% vs. 3%) represent different underlying distributions (p < 0.001). Specifically, genes involved in amine metabolism are overrepresented in the set of genes that show regression with temperature as compared with the remaining sequences. This significant increase is found for two other non-mutually exclusive GO terms: amino acid and derivative metabolism, and amino acid metabolism (p < 0.05). Other GO terms show a reverse trend although none were statistically significant. For example, ion transport (p = 0.08) and cell growth (p = 0.16) had few genes with a clinal variation in expression. These data suggest that the functions of genes influence whether they are affected by ecologically interesting patterns of expression ( Fig 5) .",

FunnyBase provides an integrated method to annotate ESTs with the most biologically relevant set of associations and provides several innovations for the production of ESTs for microarrays. Control sequences are identified in each 96-well plate so that mislabelled or inverted plates are automatically detected. Annotations are based upon several different public databases. The multiple annotations provide greater assurance about gene description and greater frequency of annotation than any one database. The most functionally informative innovation of FunnyBase is the process of culling through numerous primary similarity search results in order to identify links to systematic functional databases in GO and KEGG. These provide a discrete set of terms that can be analyzed statistically and that are organized into networks that represent biological knowledge of higher-level functional and pathway associations. The range of databases queried by similarity search and the tracking of homology beyond a single 'best' hit maximizes the opportunity to obtain this annotation. A richer set of GO terms is achieved by using all hits with evalues less than 10 -11 that represent the same gene as the 'best hit'. Additional GO terms that represent more general functions than those found in public annotation are derived through the parent-child relationship of the Gene Ontology. EC numbers provide links, via KEGG, to metabolic pathways and these stored terms can be used to investigate the relationship between gene expression in specific metabolic pathways including cardiac metabo-lism [57] . To provide a more accurate accounting of the number of unique genes, consensus sequence from clusters of ESTs were queried against the Human RefSeq database and those sequences sharing the same gene symbol are grouped based on this scaffolding information. These approaches use publicly available bioinformatics tools (BLAST, CAP3, Phred, Cross-Match, Perl, and the MySQL database management system). The application of theses tools in an appropriate framework as outlined in Funny-Base can be used to create a systems level functional genomics annotation system useful for EST databases to study biological processes among a rich diversity of organisms.",

The pSmart-cDNA vector was designed for EST work. The vector expresses kanamycinresistance and has a terminator on both sides of the cDNA insertion site preventing expression of cDNA. These two attributes (non-expression and Kan-resistance) increase the stability of different genes in the library versus cDNA libraries in Amp libraries with Lac promoters (Crawford, unpublished) .

These PCR products (PCR-cDNAs) were denatured and hybridized to single stranded plasmids from the cardiac cDNA library. Taking advantage of Cot values, the most abundant cDNAs were annealed to the more abundant PCR products and were removed selectively by hydroxyapatite-column chromatography.

To characterize cDNAs, 96 individual bacterial colonies from the normalized library were randomly chosen, and each was grown in 1.25 ml of Superbroth in 2 ml-96 well plates. After 18 hours of growth, two 250 ul bacterial glycerol stocks were made and stored in 96 well plates at -80\u00b0C. One microliter of these bacterial growths was used for PCR reactions using forward and reverse plasmid specific primers: (PucF = CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGT-CACG, PucR = GAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAA). PCR reactions had 0.2 mM dNTPs, 10 pmoles of each primer, 1 unit of Promega Taq (0.2 ul), and reaction buffer with detergents and DMSO (final concentrations: 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 9.2 (25\u00b0C), 16 mM (NH 4 )2SO 4 , 2.25 mM MgCl 2 , 2% (v/v) DMSO, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). Twostep thermal cycle conditions were used (94\u00b0C for 10 sec-onds; then 32 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds followed by 70\u00b0C for 5 minutes; then 72\u00b0C for 15 minutes). PCR products were purified manually in 96 well format using Sephadex G-50 in a deep well plate with a 0.2 microfilter (Millipore, Billerica, USA) or robotically using AmPure (Agencourt, Beverly, MA, USA) and EvolP 3 96 pipetting liquid handling system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, MA, USA).",

Two wells (#40 and #67) always contained the marker cDNA, and thus any misloading or mislabeling of sequencing lanes was identifiable. The third marker cDNA was placed in a well that corresponds to the plate number (e.g., plate 2 had the marker in well 2). 2) After the production of 12 plates, one row (8 wells) from each plate was re-sequenced. Thus, 8/96 or ~8% of all sequences and their locations were confirmed. 3) cDNAs used for microarrays were re-sequenced. These measures are important to ensure that the correct and known cDNAs are printed.",

Subtraction greatly reduced the probability of isolating the same cDNA and thus improved the efficiency of screening the library for unique clones. Subtraction used a 100-fold molar excess of biotin-labeled antisense cDNAs produced by PCR using all the characterized cDNAs as substrates and vector-specific primers in which the 3' primer was labeled with biotin. These PCR products were hybridized to the cDNA libraries in the presence of oligo-dA and vector-specific oligos (that prevented non-specific hybridization to oligo-dT or vector sequences). After a 24 hour hybridization, genes in the library that bound to these biotin-labeled PCR products were removed with the use of magnetized, streptavidin coated beads. DH10s E. coli were transformed with the subtracted library by electroporation.",

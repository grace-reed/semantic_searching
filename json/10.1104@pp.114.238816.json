Currently, the molecular mechanisms involved in the initial perception and response to dehydration are not well understood. Modern mass spectrometric methods for quantifying changes in the phosphoproteome provide an opportunity to identify key phosphorylation events involved in this process. Here, we have used both untargeted and targeted isotope-assisted mass spectrometric methods of phosphopeptide quantitation to characterize proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) whose degree of phosphorylation is rapidly altered by hyperosmotic treatment. Thus, protein phosphorylation events responsive to 5 min of 0.3 M mannitol treatment were first identified using 15 N metabolic labeling and untargeted mass spectrometry with a high-resolution ion-trap instrument. The results from these discovery experiments were then validated using targeted Selected Reaction Monitoring mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole. Targeted Selected Reaction Monitoring experiments were conducted with plants treated under nine different environmental perturbations to determine whether the phosphorylation changes were specific for osmosignaling or involved cross talk with other signaling pathways. The results indicate that regulatory proteins such as members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family are specifically phosphorylated in response to osmotic stress. Proteins involved in 59 messenger RNA decapping and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate synthesis were also identified as targets of dehydration-induced phosphoregulation. The results of these experiments demonstrate the utility of targeted phosphoproteomic analysis in understanding protein regulation networks and provide new insight into cellular processes involved in the osmotic stress response.",

Along with turgor recovery, adjustments of vital cellular processes occur, including arrest of cell growth and expansion, restructuring of the cytoskeleton, and shifts in active protein translation, that suggest heightened levels of posttranscriptional regulation (Kawaguchi et al., 2004; Fricke et al., 2006; Urano et al., 2010) . Second messengers such as Ca 2+ , reactive oxygen species (ROS), phospholipids, and protein kinases are thought to play important signaling roles during this initial response phase (Dodd et al., 2010; Munnik and Vermeer, 2010; Steinhorst and Kudla, 2013) .",

There is evidence to suggest that a similar pathway may be present in plants (Urao et al., 1999; Tran et al., 2007; Wohlbach et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2013) , and MAPK phosphorylation likely plays an important role in the osmotic stress response, as MAPK cascades are known to regulate several abiotic and biotic stress response pathways (Rodriguez et al., 2010) .",

In the absence of ABA, clade A protein phosphatase 2Cs suppress SnRK2 autophosphorylation, keeping SnRK2s in an inactive state (Park et al., 2009; Umezawa et al., 2009) . In the presence of ABA, protein phosphatase 2C suppression is relieved and SnRK2s become active, phosphorylating known downstream targets, including transcription factors that bind to ABA-responsive elements (AREBs) and ion channels (Geiger et al., 2009; Sato et al., 2009; Yoshida et al., 2010) . The 10-member SnRK2 family includes kinases that act directly in this ABA pathway (SnRK2.2, SnRK2.3, and SnRK2.6) as well as others that have not been implicated in ABA signaling but are activated during osmotic stress (Fujii and Zhu, 2009; Fujii et al., 2011; McLoughlin et al., 2012) .",

Any peptide ion meeting an abundance threshold at a given point in time is measured and sequenced through tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation using an ion-trap mass spectrometer. Because this sampling feature depends on a peptide's abundance rather than its identity, acquiring information does not require any prior knowledge of a peptide's mass or charge state.

Removing the 59 cap of mRNA is an important step in posttranscriptional regulation, as it represents movement away from active translation and functions as the rate-limiting prerequisite for exoribonuclease degradation (Jonas and Izaurralde, 2013) . VCS is a scaffold protein that holds together DCP1 and DCP2 in a protein complex that is conserved in plants and animals (Franks and Lykke-Andersen, 2008) . Our results demonstrate that VCS is phosphorylated at multiple Ser residues, with some sites increasing and some decreasing their levels of phosphorylation in response to mannitol (Fig. 3 , A-C), reflecting a complex mechanism of phosphoregulation. Nearly all of the dynamic phosphorylation changes occur in the flexible Ser-rich linker region residing between protein-binding domains (Fig. 3D ). VCS has an essential function in the posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA through both 59 decapping and microRNA degradation (Brodersen et al., 2008) . VCS associates with processing bodies, which are protein-RNA complexes that function as sites of transcript repression and degradation and are known to accumulate in response to abiotic stress (Weber et al., 2008) . Currently, the molecular mechanisms controlling VCS association with 59 decapping complex proteins and with processing bodies are unknown.",

This is due to the indiscriminate nature of MS sampling, in which any peptide meeting abundance thresholds in a certain time interval is selected for analysis, a process called data-dependent acquisition. Acquiring intensity and sequence information for all possible peptides as they enter the mass spectrometer results in frequent sampling of high-abundance species at the expense of others, because instrument space is finite and sampling occurs in a serial fashion. In our study, nearly half of all identified phosphopeptides had to be excluded from analysis because they were found in only one experimental sample (Fig. 4A ). Even repeated injections of the same sample yield poor overlap in peptide detection, a common feature inherent in the technique when complex biological samples are analyzed (Fig. 4B ). The consequence of this inadequate sample overlap is a reduction in usable data and weak statistical support for observed phosphorylation changes.",

Nearly all phosphorylation changes greater than 1.5-fold were statistically significant with P # 0.05 ( Fig. 5D ). Clustering of treatment conditions revealed some expected trends. The three conditions inducing osmotic stress, mannitol, NaCl, and KCl, cluster together with minimal differences observed between treatments (Fig. 6A ). This shared response between the neutral osmolyte, mannitol, and the charged salts, sodium and potassium chloride, indicates that the ionic component of salt stress does not have a unique influence on the phosphorylation of many of the selected proteins. In contrast to the overlap observed among the mannitol and salt phosphorylation responses, ABA treatment appears to have a unique response and little overlap with the other treatments at 5 min. Known components of the ABA receptor signaling pathway show large changes in phosphorylation, while a minimal response is seen with all other protein targets (Fig. 6A ). These components include SnRK2 kinases involved in ABA signaling (SnRK2.2, SnRK2.3, and SnRK2.6), AREB transcription factors, and class B heat shock factor HSFB2B. Interestingly, AREBs and HSFB2B experience large changes in phosphorylation under osmotic and defense-related conditions, while ABA-responsive SnRK2s do not. This indicates that these transcription factors are likely regulated by alternate phosphorylation pathways and may represent a mechanism of cross talk between various abiotic and biotic signaling networks.",

Increased phosphorylation of the most C-terminal Thr, referred to as the penultimate Thr, activates the pump through increased binding with a 14-3-3 protein (Olsson et al., 1998) . In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser-899, also located in this C-terminal regulatory domain, is proposed to inhibit pump activity, although the mechanism by which this acts is less well understood (Haruta et al., 2014) . In our targeted analysis, the two most highly expressed H + -ATPase (AHA) family members in Arabidopsis, AHA1 and AHA2, display coordinated regulation at the penultimate position (AHA1 pT948 and AHA2 pT947) and are responsive to several treatments (Fig. 6B) . We observed phosphorylation increases in response to fusicoccin, a fungal pathogen known to cause pump hyperactivation, and phosphorylation decreases in response to cold, H 2 O 2 , and mannitol. Pump inhibition via pS899 phosphorylation is seen in response to Flg22 and to a lesser extent in H O 2 and salt treatments, although these findings have less statistical support. Interestingly, these results indicate that AHA2 down-regulation occurs by two distinct mechanisms (dephosphorylation of Thr-947/948 versus phosphorylation of Ser-899) that vary based on treatment conditions.",

Our phosphorylation data show that AHAs are not being activated through penultimate Thr phosphorylation in the first 5 min of the mannitol stress response. In contrast, AHA activity appears to be down-regulated through decreased penultimate Thr phosphorylation in AHA1 and AHA2. This pattern of phosphoregulation is distinct from the AHA response to KCl treatment, suggesting that these different forms of osmotic stress have unique effects on AHA activity.

MAP4Ka1 is one of three mannitol-responsive MAP4Ks identified in this study (Supplemental Table S1 ) that belong to the poorly characterized MAP4K 10-member gene family in Arabidopsis (Champion et al., 2004) .

It is unknown if a similar osmotic stress MAP4K signaling hierarchy is active in plants. In addition to MAPK family members, proteins involved in cytoskeleton restructuring and phospholipid production cluster in the osmotic-responsive phosphorylation group.

Recently, TUA phosphorylation at this residue was shown to influence overall microtubule stability (Fujita et al., 2013) . This previous work showed that TUA phosphorylation occurred under osmotic stress conditions and resulted in a polymerizationincompetent protein isoform that contributed to microtubule destabilization and depolymerization (Ban et al., 2013; Fujita et al., 2013) . This finding was significant because microtubule depolymerization and restructuring are known to occur in response to several abiotic stresses (Nick, 2008; Wang et al., 2011) and are required for seedling survival under salt stress (Wang et al., 2007) , but the mechanistic details underlying stress-induced depolymerization were previously unknown. Our data support these recent findings and provide further description of rapid TUA phosphorylation ( Fig. 6A ).",

Vac14 is a scaffold protein that holds together a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase Fab1/PIKfyve, and a PI(3,5)P 2 phosphatase, Fig4/Sac3, in a conserved complex responsible for PI(3,5)P 2 production that is found in all eukaryotes (Dove and Johnson, 2007) . The coordination of lipid kinase and phosphatase within the same complex speaks to the highly controlled nature of PI(3,5) P 2 metabolism. Although Vac14 function has yet to be described in plants, our data indicate that it is highly responsive to osmotic perturbations (Fig. 7A) . PI(3,5)P 2 levels are known to rapidly increase in response to osmotic stress in plants, green algae, and yeast (Meijer et al., 1999; Bonangelino et al., 2002; Zonia and Munnik, 2004) , with as much as 20-fold induction within 5 min of treatment in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Duex et al., 2006) .

Asterisks indicate phosphorylation changes with P , 0.05 (Student's t test). FC, Fusicoccin; JA, methyl jasmonate. Interestingly, Vac14 is required for stress-induced PI(3,5) P 2 production in yeast (Bonangelino et al., 2002) , although the details regarding its regulation are unknown. The protein sequence of Vac14 is highly conserved from yeast to human, but phosphorylation occurs at a variable C-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 7B ). This phosphorylation site is not present in yeast and mammals and is conserved in land plants (Fig. 7C) . These data indicate the presence of a Vac14 phosphoregulation mechanism involved in the hyperosmotic response that is unique to plants.",

Half of the osmoticblock proteins displayed increasing or plateauing phosphorylation over the entire time period (Fig. 8A) , while the other half showed a peak at earlier time points followed by a dropoff at 10 min (Fig. 8B) . Vac14, SnRK2.4, and MyoB1, a plant-specific myosin adaptor protein recently shown to be involved in cytoplasmic streaming (Peremyslov et al., 2013) , displayed maximal phosphorylation at 2 min. The rapid phosphorylation of SnRK2.4 is consistent with previous in vitro kinase activity results that showed rapid and transient SnRK2.4 activation following salt and mannitol treatment of Arabidopsis roots (McLoughlin et al., 2012) . Interestingly, the phosphorylation profile of Vac14 over time closely mirrors stress-induced PI(3,5)P 2 production in yeast and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which peaks at 5 min and is reduced by 15 min following treatment (Meijer et al., 1999; Duex et al., 2006) .",

When minimal to no response was observed at early time points, later sampling values were selected (24 h or less). A complete list of selected microarray experiments is found in Supplemental Table S5 . Heat-map arrangement of expression data in the same orientation as phosphopeptide clustering reveals minimal overlap between protein phosphorylation and mRNA measurements (Fig. 8C ). This is particularly true for osmotic-block genes, which show no salt-or mannitol-induced changes in gene expression, with the exception of TUA and the unknown protein Constitutive photomorphogenesis protein1-interacting related. Expanding this analysis to all available experiments related to salt, osmotic, and drought stress reveals a similar trend of minimal to no correlation of the phosphorylation and transcriptional responses (Supplemental Fig. S2 ).

The reproducibility of the discovery data was high, with all phosphopeptides showing similar responses except ADH1 pS229, PIP2F pS283, and oxidoreductase pS29 (Table I) . These phosphopeptides likely represent false positives in our discovery data sets, as quantification was based on only two biological replicates in which over 1,200 phosphopeptides were quantified. It is possible that the original phosphorylation changes identified for ADH1 and oxidoreductase were the result of differential protein abundance rather than phosphorylation change, as no additional peptides were identified for either of these proteins; thus, no conclusion can be made regarding protein levels in each sample. The inability to comprehensively address protein abundance is an inherent limitation of phosphopeptide enrichment. This fact underscores the importance of rapid phosphorylation analysis to observe phosphorylation responses before the onset of significant changes in protein synthesis/breakdown. Our data set was collected following 5 min of mannitol treatment, but SRM time-course data reveal that some phosphopeptides show the highest response to mannitol after only 2 min of treatment. This suggests a need to sample at more immediate time points, as important phosphorylation responses may have been missed at 5 min.",

Our data identifying VCS, VCR, and DCP2 phosphorylation increases following mannitol treatment suggest that 59 mRNA decapping is altered during osmotic stress. Targeted analysis of VCS phosphorylation indicates that this response is specific to hyperosmotic conditions and increases with treatment duration. VCS functions as a scaffold protein for the decapping proteins DCP1 and DCP2. These proteins localize to processing bodies, which are aggregations of mRNA and proteins associated with transcript repression and degradation that increase following stress treatment (Franks and Lykke-Andersen, 2008) . It is unclear what regulates 59 decapping complex assembly and processing body formation, although some evidence exists suggesting that phosphorylation plays an important role. In yeast, phosphorylation of DCP2 by MAP4K Ste20 increases the DCP2 association with processing bodies (Yoon et al., 2010) . In plants, DCP1 is phosphorylated by MAPK6 in response to dehydration stress, and work with phosphomimetic mutants suggests that phosphorylation enhances 59 mRNA decapping (Xu and Chua, 2012) . Similar phosphoregulation of VCS has not yet been described, although it has recently been shown to be phosphorylated in response to 30 min of mannitol treatment in Arabidopsis (Xu and Chua, 2012) . It is possible that stressinduced VCS phosphorylation modulates VCS activity in a way that promotes decapping complex assembly and association with processing bodies to control posttranscriptional reprogramming during dehydration stress.",

In yeast, PI(3,5) P 2 is predominantly localized to the vacuole, where it is required for proper vacuole function and morphology. Osmotic stress causes increased PI(3,5)P production, and these increases are essential for vacuolar volume adjustment (Dove et al., 1997; Bonangelino et al., 2002; Ho et al., 2012) . Vac14 is a scaffold protein for PI(3,5)P 2 synthesis and is required for this stressinduced PI(3,5)P 2 production (Bonangelino et al., 2002) . Our finding of Vac14 phosphorylation following osmotic perturbation suggests a point of regulation in the PI(3,5)P 2 accumulation process. It is possible that phosphorylation mediates complex assembly with PI3P-5-kinase Fab1 during the stress response. Recent work disrupting Fab1 function in plants reveals that PI (3,5)P 2 production is required for proper stomata closure in response to ABA (Bak et al., 2013) . PI(3,5)P 2 is also required for polarized cell growth and influences actin filament rearrangement in moss (van Gisbergen et al., 2012) . Thus, PI(3,5)P 2 levels have been linked directly to growth-and drought-related processes. Our identification of Vac14 phosphorylation changes is a starting point toward understanding how this protein involved in PI(3,5)P 2 production is regulated in plants.",

These proteins act as plant-specific myosin adaptors that anchor vesicles involved in cytoplasmic streaming to high-speed myosin XI motors (Peremyslov et al., 2013) . Our data indicate that MyoB1 is phosphorylated specifically in response to osmotic stress and shows the highest degree of phosphorylation at 2 min.

Briefly, plants were grown in modified Murashige and Skoog medium containing 1% (w/v) Suc, 0.05% (w/v) MES salt, and either ammonium and potassium nitrate or 15 N-enriched ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate (more than 98% 15 N; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the sole nitrogen source. After 10 d, mannitol treatment was applied by decanting the existing medium and replacing with control medium or medium containing 0.3 M mannitol. After 5 min of treatment, plant samples were flash frozen and homogenized. Samples were then combined in an experimental pair consisting of one treated sample grown in 14 N medium and one control sample grown in 15 N medium. For the second reciprocal experimental pair, the samples were combined in the inverse fashion ( N treated and N control). Ground frozen tissue was combined at a 1:1 weight ratio prior to further homogenization. For targeted proteomic experiments, sample medium consisted of one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog salts, 1% (w/v) Suc, and 0.05% (w/v) MES salt. After 11 d of growth, sample medium was replaced with fresh medium and allowed to equilibrate for 4 to 5 h prior to experimental treatment. Treatment was applied in the same manner as described for the untargeted experiments. Three biological replicates were processed for each treatment condition. For all experiments, samples were further homogenized in grinding buffer (Huttlin et al., 2007) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors using a sonicator (1-cm probe, 5 10 s, and 50% duty cycle) while kept on ice. The resulting supernatant was filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and underwent a soft spin (1,500g, 20 min, and 4\u00b0C) to remove unbroken cells.",

Precipitated proteins were solubilized in 8 M urea-containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture (13 PhosStop; Roche). Samples were diluted to 2 M urea, and protein concentration was measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit (BCA, Thermo Scientific Pierce). Five milligrams of protein from microsome and soluble fractions was reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (45 min at 50\u00b0C) and alkylated using 15 mM iodoacetamide (45 min at room temperature). Samples were then diluted to 1.2 M urea using 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 and digested with trypsin (Promega) at a 1:100 enzyme:protein ratio overnight at 37\u00b0C. Samples were acidified using 0.5% (v/v) formic acid to stop enzymatic digestion and desalted using C-18 solid-phase extraction columns (Waters). Soluble fractions were then subject to further fractionation via SCX chromatographic separation using a polysulfoethyl aspartamide column (4.6 3 200 mm; PolyLC) on a Waters Alliance 2795 HPLC device. Separation was achieved using a 0% to 25% (v/v) buffer B (5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 350 mM KCl, and 30% [v/v] acetonitrile  [ACN] , pH 2.65) gradient over 33 min at a flow rate of 3 mL min 21 . The gradient was followed by a 100% buffer B wash and reequilibration with buffer A (5 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 30% [v/v] ACN, pH 2.65). Independent fractions were collected every 4 min, and blanks were run between samples to ensure no carryover. Sample fractions were flash frozen, lyophilized, and desalted using solid-phase extraction. SCX fractions 3 to 8 and microsome samples were enriched for phosphopeptides using titanium dioxide (TiO ) particles (5 mm; GL Sciences) as described previously (Sugiyama et al., 2007; Minkoff et al., 2014) .",

Briefly, samples were separated by HPLC using an 11-cm C-18 packed analytical column and a 240-min ACN gradient in line with MS analysis. Two to three injection replicates were performed for each sample. Acquired data files containing MS/MS spectra were searched against The Arabidopsis Information Resource 9 protein database using MASCOT software (Matrix Science). Search parameters were set at two allowed missed cleavages, precursor and fragment ion mass tolerances of 15 ppm and 0.6 D, respectively, fixed modifications of Cys carbamidomethylation, and variable modifications of Met oxidation, Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation, and Asn/Gln deamidation. Searches were performed using settings for both N and 15 N protein masses. MASCOT search results were filtered to maintain a 1% false discovery rate at the peptide level using a reverse-protein sequence database and in-house software. The software determines the minimum MASCOT score in which 1% of MS/MS peptide identifications match the decoy reverse-protein sequence database. All peptide identifications scoring lower than this calculated MASCOT score were excluded from analysis. Quantitative ratio measurements from MS1 peak areas were performed using Census software (Park et al., 2008) as described by Kline et al. (2010) . To correct for errors in mixing ratios (i.e. initial combination of N and 15 N ground, frozen tissue), all data sets for each experimental sample were normalized to the median N-15 N area ratio value. Only phosphopeptides quantified in both experiments 1 and 2 were considered for analysis. Phosphopeptides showing reciprocal changes of 1.5-fold or greater were manually validated by visual inspection of Census chromatograms. MS/MS spectra were manually validated for all phosphopeptides in Supplemental Tables S1 and S3 and can be found in Supplemental Figure S1 .",

This initial precipitation step was added to reduce sample volume. Extracted protein was resuspended and quantified by a bicinchoninic acid assay kit as described for the untargeted sample preparation above. For each sample, 3 mg of protein was spiked with isotopically labeled phosphopeptide standards, synthesized by the Sigma-Aldrich PEPscreen platform, Sigma-Aldrich AQUA, or the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center's peptide synthesis core facility. Phosphopeptide standards were pooled into a master mix, divided into aliquots, and frozen. Each batch of samples received a spike from the same phosphopeptide standard master mix aliquot to avoid the variability that may arise from peptide loss due to freeze-thaw cycles or retention in plastic tubes. The concentration of each phosphopeptide standard in the master mix was individually tailored to generate optimum signal levels during SRM analysis. Calculations were based on empirically determined chromatographic and mass spectrometric behavior of the phosphopeptide standards.

SRM method development was performed using peptide standards and MRMPilot software (AB SCIEX). Multiple fragment ions were tested for each peptide using both in silico predictions and acquired MS/MS spectra. The three to five most abundant parent ion-to-fragment ion transitions were selected, and collision energies were optimized to maximize fragment ion intensity. The developed method was pilot tested, and the number of transitions for each peptide was reduced to three through the removal of the lowest quality transitions that performed poorly in complex sample backgrounds. In the final method, three transitions per peptide were monitored using scheduled data acquisition with a target scan time of 3.1 s and a detection window of 170 s. A list of SRM transitions used for each endogenous peptide and peptide standard can be found in Supplemental Table S3 . Analytical separation was performed using a linear gradient of 2% to 35% (v/v) buffer B (ACN and 0.1% [v/v] formic acid; Honeywell Burdick and Jackson) over 70 min at a flow rate of 300 nL min 21 . The gradient was followed by a 90% (v/v) buffer B wash and reequilibration with buffer A (0.1% [v/v] formic acid; Honeywell Burdick and Jackson). Peak areas were integrated using the automatic MQ4 function in MultiQuant software (AB SCIEX). Peak integration parameters were set as follows: 40% noise, a baseline subtraction window of 0.5 min, and peak splitting of 0 to 2 points with a Gaussian smooth width of 0.8 to 1 point. In all cases, identical integration parameters were used for standard and endogenous peptide area quantification. To determine the levels of endogenous peptide in each sample, the peak areas for endogenous peptides were normalized to the peak areas for the corresponding peptide standard for each transition within each run. Transitions that had low signal intensity or contained isobaric interference were not used for quantification and are indicated in Supplemental Table S3 . For each treatment condition, peptides were quantified from two to four injection replicates for three independent biological replicates. To determine phosphorylation changes, standard-normalized endogenous phosphopeptide abundances were first averaged across biological replicates and then compared across treated and control conditions as a ratio.",

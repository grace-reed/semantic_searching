This is especially relevant when the samples have been obtained from different individuals, different tissues and different time courses, and will result in the misinterpretation of the derived expression profile of the target genes. Therefore, normalization of target gene expression levels must be performed to compensate intra-and inter-kinetic RT-PCR variations (sample-to-sample and run-torun variations) [9] . q-RT-PCR data normalization can be carried out against total cellular DNA or RNA content (molecules/g total DNA/RNA and concentrations/g total DNA/RNA) or against endogenous unregulated reference gene transcript. Normalization according the total cellular RNA content has increasingly been used, but little is known about the total RNA content of cells or even about the mRNA concentrations [10] . The content per cell or per gram tissue may vary in different tissues in vivo, in cell culture (in vitro), between individuals and under different experimental conditions. Alternatively, relative quantification can be determined by normalizing the level of expression of a gene of interest relative to the levels of an endogenous reference gene, also called internal control or most popularly termed housekeeping gene (HKG). This housekeeping gene can be co-amplified in the same tube in a multiplex assay or can be amplified in a separate tube. Therefore, relative quantification using HKGs does not require standards with known concentrations and the reference can be any transcript, as long as its sequence is known. The normalization values for different samples can be then directly compared [10] .",

Because the expression of the target gene is measured relative to the housekeeping gene, it is critical that these assumptions hold. However, it has become clear that no single housekeeping gene can be used for all studies and that the choice of the control gene depends on the tissue type and the experimental conditions [11] [12] [13] . Furthermore, it has been shown that normalization based on a single housekeeping gene led to erroneous quantifications of up to 3-fold in 25% of cases and 6.4-fold in 10% of cases, with sporadic cases showing errors greater than 20-fold [14] . It is recommended, instead normalizing the gene expression of gene of interests to the geometric mean of several housekeeping genes [14] .

The justification of this approach lies on the fact that only small proportions of genes from large, comprehensive cDNA microarrays tend to be differentially expressed under any experimental design, leaving the gene expression of most of the genes on the microarrays unalterable. Because of this, microarray experiments can be self-normalized using the data from the thousands of genes in the array that do not change expression [15] . Thus, microarrays offer a great advantage in mining for candidate HKGs.",

In this way, variation of the expression ratios of two actual housekeeping genes reflects the fact that one (or both) of the genes is (are) not constantly expressed, with increasing variation in ratio corresponding to decreasing expression stability (M value). For every candidate housekeeping gene, we determined the pairwise variation with all other candidate control genes as the standard variation of the logarithmically transformed expression ratios, which was defined as the internal control genestability measure \"M value\", the average pairwise variation of a particular gene with all other control genes.

But it is becoming widely accepted that HKGs need careful validation before their use in quantitative mRNA assays. For instance, Murphy et al.

It has been well documented that ribosomes depleted of L7/L12 protein cores inefficiently support protein synthesis and exhibit a higher error frequency [22, 23] . The proteins interact with initiation-, elongation-, and release factors, and are responsible for the factordependent GTP hydrolysis [24, 25] .

Two types of conserved eukaryotic Poly(a) binding proteins have been described so far in detail, one being localized in the cytoplasm, which is present in all eukaryotes and plays important roles in at least two processes within nucleic acid metabolism, translation and mRNA decay; and another type localized in the nucleus, which was discovered through its role in polyadenylation of mRNA precursors, and is also ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms [26] . This group of proteins has been implicated in global gene regulation, both stimulating translation initiation [27] and by enhancing mRNA stability and function [28] . Therefore they play a significant role in keeping steady the healthy levels of nucleic acid metabolism, which make them good candidate housekeeping genes to be used as control gene for normalization of gene expression data.

We are proposing in this study several housekeeping genes that were successfully used to normalize gene expression data in cnidarian/algal symbiosis experiments. These genes may also be tested as normalizing genes in other coral/cnidarian gene expression studies. This is currently very feasible, as these genes have also already been pulled out from the Nemastostella genome [31] and from the Acropora millepora [32] coral EST project. Furthermore, the gene expression of Beta-actin (our most stable housekeeping gene) has also been shown to be stable in the coral A. millepora under different thermal stresses (Seneca et al. in preparation). These findings are promising and we then encourage other researchers to test, under other different experimental scenarios of interest, not only the three best-performing HKGs showed here but as well the other three normalizing genes reported in this study.",

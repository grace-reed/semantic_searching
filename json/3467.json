Although considerable previous evidence has suggested that glycerol might be a major translocated metabolite, we saw no significant labeling of glycerol within the first hour, and incubation of intact animals with 13 C-labeled glycerol did not result in a rapid production of 13 C-glucose. In contrast, when Symbiodinium cells freshly isolated from host tissue were exposed to light and 13 C-bicarbonate in the presence of host homogenate, labeled glycerol, but not glucose, was detected in the medium. We also observed early production of labeled glucose, but not glycerol, in three coral species.

The principal architects of these reefs are the coral animals (Phylum Cnidaria), whose ability to grow in nutrient-poor waters and deposit the calcareous skeletons that form the backbone of the reefs depends on their receipt of photosynthetically fixed carbon from their intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts (genus Symbiodinium). The algae can provide >90% of their photosynthate to the host, thus supplying >90% of the host's total energy requirements for maintenance, growth and calcium carbonate deposition (Falkowski et al., 1984) ; in turn, the host provides protection and passes a variety of other nutrients to the algae (Rahav et al., 1989) .",

When the symbiosis is disrupted (known as coral bleaching because of the loss of photosynthesis-related pigments or the entire pigmented dinoflagellates), the host often dies, and the reef begins to erode. Major bleaching events have occurred multiple times in various parts of the world over the past 20\uf020years, and there has been a loss of 317,000\uf020ha of live-coral coverage per year in the Indo-Pacific alone (Bruno and Selig, 2007) . To improve the prospects for arresting or reversing the decline of coral reefs, a much more detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of the dinoflagellate-cnidarian symbiosis is needed, including a better understanding of the metabolites transferred between alga and host and the mechanisms by which such transport is achieved and regulated.",

Since that pioneering study, numerous investigations have attempted to identify the transferred metabolite(s) using a wide variety of biological systems and experimental approaches. These studies have obtained a variety of results, as recently reviewed by others (Venn et al., 2008; Yellowlees et al., 2008; Davy et al., 2012) . Briefly, the methods used have included: (1) detecting metabolites in the animal tissue that the animal itself was incapable of synthesizing; (2) isolating Symbiodinium cells from host tissue, exposing them to labeled substrate along with host homogenate or potential 'host release factors', and determining what compounds are released from the algae; and (3) exposing the intact holobionts to labeled compound(s), fractionating to separate host and algal components, and identifying the labeled compounds in each fraction. In addition, in the related Symbiodinium-giant-clam symbiosis, fluids have been withdrawn from intact organisms after labeling and then analyzed. In most studies, thin-layer chromatography and autoradiography have been used to identify the labeled compounds.",

However, glucose, succinate, fumarate, a variety of amino acids, and various lipids have also been detected in some studies and suggested to be among the major transferred compounds. In addition, several recent studies using intact systems have not found labeled glycerol. For example, in the giant clam, where the symbiotic algae are extracellular, significant concentrations of glucose, but not of glycerol, were detected in the hemolymph (Rees et al., 1993) . However, Ishikura and co-workers did detect labeled glycerol when dinoflagellates freshly isolated from the clams were exposed to host homogenate or when the host mantle was damaged, even though exogenously supplied labeled glycerol was not converted rapidly to glucose in the amounts seen in the intact system (Ishikura et al., 1999) . Similarly, when the anemone Anemonia viridis was fractionated after labeling the intact holobiont, the host fraction was found to contain 14 C-labeled amino acids, glucose, malate, succinate and fumarate, but no detectable glycerol (Whitehead and Douglas, 2003) . Taken together, these studies have raised the possibility that glycerol production and/or release is linked to damage to the symbiotic systems rather than being integral to the intact symbiosis.",

However, it also seems possible that technical difficulties have led to misleading results in many studies. Indeed, to a greater or lesser extent, all of the earlier studies have suffered from one or more of the following potential problems. (1) Algae isolated from host tissue may no longer behave normally, regardless of whether they are treated with host homogenate or artificial mixtures designed to mimic it. (2) The centrifugation steps used to separate host and algal fractions after labeling require many minutes of preparation time before analysis, often at room temperature or above, during which metabolism of the initially labeled and transferred compounds might continue. (3) Thin-layer chromatography requires standards to determine the identities of the compounds detected (thus causing a problem if any unexpected compounds are present in the mix) and also suffers from poor resolution of different compounds. (4) Autoradiograms can take weeks or months to develop (thus hindering any kind of iterative experimentation) and do not provide information on the proportion of the pool of each compound that is labeled, but rather just on the size of the labeled sub-pool.",

One experiment used a clonal population (H1) derived from a single anemone of Hawaiian origin (and thus presumably of species A. pulchella; S. R. Santos, personal communication) containing its endogenous clade B Symbiodinium. Some experiments used aposymbiotic (dinoflagellate-free) animals derived from CC7. To produce these animals, CC7 anemones were first incubated in ASW at 4\u00b0C for 4\uf020h (resulting in ejection of a mass of material containing many dinoflagellates) and then in ASW containing 50\uf020mmol\uf020l -1 DCMU at 24\u00b0C under fluorescent lights (20-40\uf020mE\uf020m -2 \uf020s -1 ) for several days. [All light levels indicated are given as photosynthetically active radiation, measured with a GMSW-SS quantum meter (Apogee, Logan, UT).] These steps were repeated until all animals were conspicuously pale (two to three cycles), after which animals were kept in ASW containing 2-5\uf020mmol\uf020l -1 DCMU for several weeks under fluorescent lights with a 12\uf020h:12\uf020h light:dark cycle (20-40\uf020mE\uf020m -2 \uf020s -1 ). Animals in several separate tanks were then washed to remove DCMU, placed under normal culture conditions (see below) for several weeks, and examined periodically by fluorescence microscopy to detect the chlorophyll fluorescence of any residual dinoflagellates. Tanks in which all animals appeared dinoflagellate-free were used as sources of aposymbiotic animals. For routine culture, anemones were maintained in ASW at approximately 24\u00b0C with light provided by a window and/or Cool White fluorescent bulbs at ~20-40\uf020mE\uf020m -2 \uf020s -1 (light:dark \u2248 12\uf020h:12\uf020h) and feeding several times weekly with freshly hatched Artemia nauplii. For 7-14\uf020days before use in an experiment, anemones were starved. During the 2\uf020days immediately before an experiment, animals were rinsed repeatedly in ASW to remove any algae attached to their outer surfaces and inspected microscopically to ensure that all food had been digested.",

The magnitude of each m/z reading was recorded at the point in the GC chromatogram at which the sum of the readings for the unlabeled and labeled fragments was largest. When both fully labeled and partially labeled fragments were observed, the former was used in the analysis. The magnitude of the m/z reading for the labeled compound was divided by the sum of itself and the magnitude of The Journal of Experimental Biology 215 (19) the m/z reading for the unlabeled compound to derive the peak ratios used in the analyses. An exact binomial test on the actual counts was used to determine 95% confidence intervals for the peak-ratio data points. When two data points were to be compared (e.g. different labeling conditions or times of labeling) and a P-value was needed, Fisher's exact tests were performed to compare the actual counts. For example, to determine whether the glucose labeling observed at early time points in Fig.\uf0204 was significant, the values obtained for exposure to 13 C-bicarbonate in the light were compared in this way to the values obtained for exposure to 13 C-bicarbonate in the dark and those for exposure to 12 C-bicarbonate in the light. A difference in labeling was considered significant if the counts observed for one data point differed from those for the other at P\u22640.05. Statistical tests were performed using R (R Development Core Team, 2009) .",

Moreover, the standards yielded m/z peaks in the MS that could readily be used for quantitation (e.g. full-length glycerol and succinate and a four-carbon fragment of glucose; supplementary material Fig.\uf020S2D ,F,G; note that the m/z values are those for the derivatized compounds and see legend for more details).

We examined more closely the GC peak presumed (from its elution time and m/z spectrum) to represent glucose. This peak increased significantly when symbiotic animals were incubated for 10\uf020min in the light (compare Fig.\uf0202A ,C with 2B), suggesting that there were only low levels of free glucose in the starved animals in the dark, so that photosynthetically produced glucose could be readily detected. In the absence of 13 C label or in the dark, the m/z peak for the four-carbon fragment was at 319 (Fig.\uf0202D,E) , but after labeling with 13 C-bicarbonate for 10\uf020min in the light, this peak was partially replaced by one with m/z 323 ( Fig.\uf0202F) , as expected. This shift allows determination of the fractions of glucose labeled in time-course experiments by a peakratio method, dividing the sum of intensities in the 323 m/z peak by the sums of intensities in both the 319 and 323\uf020m/z peaks [323/(319+323) ratio]; the same method can be applied to glycerol [221/(218+221) ratio; supplementary material Fig.\uf020S2D ,E], succinate [251/(247+251) ratio; supplementary material Fig.\uf020S2F ] and other metabolites.",

Using the protocol described in detail in the Materials and methods, we found that we could collect animals that previously had not been perturbed (except by exposure to light and/or the 13 C-bicarbonate label), homogenize them, and flash-freeze samples of the homogenate within ~1\uf020min. In addition, we could filter samples of the homogenate, rinse, and flash-freeze samples of both the filtrate and the filter (with retained material) within an additional ~1.5\uf020min (thus, ~2.5\uf020min from the time of initial collection of the animals). As expected, examination by fluorescence microscopy revealed many seemingly intact and fluorescent (by their intrinsic chlorophyll fluorescence) dinoflagellate cells on the top of the filter but not on its bottom or in the filtrate. Some host cells appeared to remain intact and were retained on the filter, but the amount of this material was clearly small in relation to both the dinoflagellate material retained on the filter and the amount of host material (cytoplasm plus organelles) that had passed through into the filtrate. To address the possibility that the homogenization and filtration protocol might cause disruption of the dinoflagellate cells and/or leaching of metabolites from them, we performed tests using both Symbiodinium freshly isolated from host tissue and Symbiodinium cells from culture. In both cases, it appeared that the dinoflagellate cells remained largely or entirely intact and released little of their newly synthesized glucose after labeling in isolation from host tissue ( Fig.\uf0203 and data not shown); note that the freshly isolated dinoflagellates had in fact passed through the PowerGen 125 Homogenizer twice (during homogenization of the host and again during the mock homogenization) without losing their integrity.",

[Note that most or all of the apparent labeling of the glycerol in the homogenate-only sample in Fig.\uf0207B is actually a quirk of the peak-ratio method as applied to molecules, such as this fragment of derivatized glycerol, that have a high ratio of trimethylsilyl groups to carbon. As shown in supplementary material Fig.\uf020S2 , naturally occurring 13 C, 29 Si and 30 Si result in enough material at m/z 221 that the 221/(218+221) ratio is ~0.08 even for a sample of unlabeled glycerol.] When we monitored glucose instead of glycerol in these experiments, we observed an apparent stimulation of glucose production (total cellular amounts of glucose were higher), but no detectable glucose release, by the algal cells (Fig.\uf0207C, see also Fig.\uf0203 ). Taken together, these data suggest that the glycerol observed in host homogenate and that released by the algae during the incubations do not result from metabolic conversion of released glucose to glycerol and thus presumably represent a substantial pool of glycerol in host cytoplasm in the intact organisms (see the presumed glycerol peak at 15.0\uf020min in Fig.\uf0201 ), glycerol released from the algae during homogenization and centrifugation (perhaps as part of a stress response), or both. In any case, the observation that inclusion of algae in the host homogenate during the incubation with Cbicarbonate has little effect on the total amount of glycerol, while substantially increasing its fraction labeled (Fig.\uf0207A,B) , suggests that newly synthesized (and thus labeled) and previously present glycerol exchange across the dinoflagellate surface during the course of the incubation.",

First, labeling was performed on intact, minimally perturbed organisms and used the stable isotope 13 C, thus avoiding the complications of working with radioactive 14 C. Second, using a commercially available motorized homogenizer and a custom-built filtration apparatus, we were able to achieve very rapid sampling, homogenization, separation of algal and host-tissue fractions, and freezing of samples, thus making it unlikely that identification of the primary translocated compound(s) could be obscured by metabolic transformations occurring after translocation. Third, the rapidity of GC-MS analysis allowed us to go from sample to data in <8\uf020h (as opposed to waiting weeks for an autoradiogram to develop), allowing rapid iteration of experiments when desired and opening the door to the use of 'reef metabolomics' as a diagnostic procedure. Finally, the GC-MS analytical system is very powerful. Elution times can be reproduced with precision on the order of 1\uf020s, and \u2265100 polar metabolites can be resolved as discrete GC peaks. Indeed, even compounds co-eluting from the GC can be deconvolved on the basis of their differing mass spectra. These properties allow many compounds to be identified at least tentatively using freely available standard libraries of elution times and mass spectra. As a result, although we began this study with several likely candidate metabolites based on earlier work, we were also able to conduct an essentially unbiased screen that should have detected any previously unsuspected small-molecule metabolite that was synthesized and ",

The absence of such labeling in the dark, in aposymbiotic anemones, and in anemones treated with DCMU establishes that this glucose was produced photosynthetically and not by one of the several carbon-fixation pathways found in animals (Stern, 1948) . We observed no similar rapid labeling and translocation of glycerol, succinate or other compounds. Thus, we infer that, at least in this organism, and under the growth and labeling conditions used, glucose is by far the predominant product of dinoflagellate photosynthesis that is translocated to the host. However, our examination of the nonpolar fractions was less complete and does preclude the possibility that one or more lipids are also translocated. Although we have investigated other organisms in less detail, we did obtain very similar results with a different line of Aiptasia (putatively a different species, and containing Symbiodinium from a different major clade) and with three species of coral. These results suggest that glucose may in general be the primary translocated compound in dinoflagellate-cnidarian symbioses. Some earlier studies also detected glucose as an apparently transferred metabolite in dinoflagellate-cnidarian symbiosis. Notably, in a careful study in which intact Anemonia viridis anemones were labeled with 14 Cbicarbonate, Whitehead and Douglas found glucose and several other small molecules as prominently labeled metabolites in the host tissue (Whitehead and Douglas, 2003) . Glucose also appears to be the major compound released by Symbiodinium to the host in the undisturbed dinoflagellate-giant-clam symbiosis (Ishikura et al., 1999) . However, further investigations of this issue will clearly be necessary. For example, it will be of great interest to determine whether methods similar to those used here detect other translocated compounds in different Symbiodinium-cnidarian combinations or when the organisms are subjected to different conditions such as different temperatures, light regimens or bicarbonate concentrations.",

Thus, it appears that there must be highly efficient mechanisms for translocation of newly synthesized glucose across the several membranes separating the chloroplast interior from the host cytoplasm, a conclusion that is not surprising given previous evidence that >90% of new photosynthetic product is transferred from dinoflagellate to host (Falkowski et al., 1984) . The percentages labeled (of glucose and other compounds) do eventually become similar in the algal and host fractions (e.g. after a week of labeling in our experiments; data not shown), indicating that whatever mechanism is responsible for the rapid export of glucose does also allow some newly produced photosynthate to remain within the algal cell.",

Instead, we found that the percentage labeling of glycerol lagged far behind the percentage labeling of glucose in the animal tissue, seemingly precluding the possibility that transfer of newly synthesized glycerol from alga to host is followed by metabolic conversion of glycerol to glucose within the host. In contrast, when we performed experiments designed to mimic earlier studies using algae freshly isolated from host tissue and incubated in the absence or presence of host homogenate, we obtained results consistent with the earlier studies. In particular, we observed: (1) substantial pools of total glycerol in both the hostcytoplasm fraction and the algal cells; (2) a rapid synthesis of labeled glycerol upon exposure to 13 C-bicarbonate in the light; (3) a rapid release of newly synthesized glycerol to the external environment; (4) a stimulation of both glycerol synthesis and release by host homogenate; and (5) an apparently abundant movement of glycerol also from homogenate back into the algal cells [as also observed previously (Grant et al., 1997) ]. In contrast, although glucose synthesis by isolated algae was also stimulated by host homogenate, no glucose release was detected.",

Thus, we think it more likely that most of the glycerol observed in our own and earlier experiments is produced by the algae as part of a stress response, a phenomenon also seen in other organisms (Westfall et al., 2004) . This conclusion appears consistent both with other evidence that isolated algae are indeed under stress (Goiran et al., 1997) and with the observations in giant clams, where glycerol was detected in the hemolymph only when the system had been disturbed (Rees et al., 1993; Ishikura et al., 1999) . It also appears consistent with our failure to observe glycerol synthesis or release when cultured dinoflagellates were tested; presumably these algae were already adapted to the conditions of culture, so that no stress response was elicited in our experiments.

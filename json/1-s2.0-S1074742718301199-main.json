It is characterized by cognitive impairments, developmental delay, sleep abnormalities, and hyperphagia often leading to obesity. Clinical research has shown that a lack of expression of SNORD116, a paternally expressed imprinted gene cluster that encodes multiple copies of a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) in both humans and mice, is most likely responsible for many PWS symptoms seen in humans. The majority of previous research using PWS preclinical models focused on characterization of the hyperphagic and metabolic phenotypes. However, a crucial understudied clinical phenotype is cognitive impairments and thus we investigated the learning and memory abilities using a model of PWS, with a heterozygous deletion in Snord116. We utilized the novel object recognition task, which doesn't require external motivation, or exhaustive swim training. Automated findings were further confirmed with manual scoring by a highly trained blinded investigator. We discovered deficits in Snord116+/\u2212 mutant mice in the novel object recognition, location memory and tone cue fear conditioning assays when compared to age-, sex-matched, littermate control Snord116+/+ mice. Further, we confirmed that despite physical neo-natal developmental delays, Snord116+/ \u2212 mice had normal exploratory and motor abilities. These results show that the Snord116+/\u2212 deletion murine model is a valuable preclinical model for investigating learning and memory impairments in individuals with PWS without common confounding phenotypes.",

                "text": "Due to the imprinted status of the 15q11-q13 locus, allele-specific mutations lead to the development of two distinct neurodevelopmental disorders. PWS results from genetic mutations leading to deficient gene expression from the paternal allele of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13), while Angelman Syndrome (AS) results from mutations inherited from the maternal allele of the same locus, emphasizing a critical neurological function of these genes (Jiang, Tsai, Bressler, & Beaudet, 1998) . Numerous mutant mouse models were generated by targeting different portions of the orthologous mouse region. The first model deleted the entire PWS/AS locus, similar to the vast majority of PWS and/or AS patients (Gabriel et al., 1999; Stefan, Portis, Longnecker, & Nicholls, 2005) . Follow-up model systems highlighted the PWS imprinting center and informed the essential nature of the epigenetic processes (Yang et al., 1998) . Several smaller deletion and single gene mutant model systems have been created to delineate the contribution of each gene in the region to aspects of the PWS phenotype. These include models deleting exons in the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (Snrpn), an RNA-protein complex that forms an RNA spliceosome (Bressler et al., 2001; Dubose, Smith, Yang, Johnstone, & Resnick, 2011; Tsai, Jiang, et al., 1999) , necdin (Ndn), which can influence multiple pathways involved in neuronal survival, differentiation and outgrowth and Magel2, a Ndn homolog that is expressed in the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex and spinal cord and key in circadian timekeeping (Kozlov et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2000) .",

                "text": "While many genes are likely involved in the entire complicated PWS phenotype (including developmental failure to thrive, metabolic anomalies, obesity, cognitive deficits, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and other psychiatric co-morbidities), analyses of rare PWS patients have determined that a \u223c200 kb deletion of a cluster of small nucleolar/noncoding RNAs (snoRNAs) within this locus is sufficient to cause PWS (Bieth et al., 2015; de Smith et al., 2009; Duker et al., 2010; Sahoo et al., 2008) . Thus, investigation into the loss of this particular group of snoRNA genes, known as the Snord116 cluster, as contributing factors is an essential step toward elucidating the neurobiology of the PWS phenotype. Ding et al. (2008) derived a novel mouse model for PWS by deleting the paternal copies of Snord116. Mice with paternally inherited Snord116+/\u2212 deletions had growth delays in the first three postnatal weeks, hyperphagia, prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin but normal pain sensitivity, motor abilities and working memory measured by the spontaneous alternation task (Ding et al., 2008) . observed significant changes in working-for-food behavioral responses at various timescales in a home cage behavioral system in Snord116+/\u2212 mice . It is unknown how or if the missing Snord116 cluster contributes to other components of the intellectual disability behavioral diagnosis in clinical populations since the overwhelming majority of previous research using PWS preclinical models focused on characterization of the hyperphagic and metabolic phenotypes. The following report carefully investigated learning and memory abilities in the heterozygous deletion Snord116+/\u2212 model of PWS. We discovered that Snord116+/\u2212 mice exhibited learning and memory impairments compared to their wildtype littermates on the low stress-standard assays of novel object recognition (NOR) and object location memory (OLM). Second, we illustrated data that were quantified with reasonable signal to noise ratio by automated tracking software, and confirmed and fine-tuned by human manual scoring. We also discovered that the Snord116+/\u2212 group showed deficits in cued but not contextual fear conditioning. Finally, we confirmed our results were not confounded by physical or motor dysfunction.",

The experiment consisted of four sessions: a 30-min exposure to the open field arena the day before the test, a 10-min re-habituation on test day, a 10-min familiarization session and a 5-min recognition test. On day 1, each subject was habituated to a clean, empty open field arena for 30-min. 24-hr later, each subject was returned to the open field arena for another 10min for the habituation phase. The mouse was then removed from the open field and placed in a clean temporary holding cage for approximately 2-min. Two identical objects were placed in the arena. Each subject was returned to the open field in which it had been habituated and allowed to freely explore for 10-min. After the familiarization session, subjects were returned to their holding cages, which were transferred from the testing room to a nearby holding area. The open field was cleaned with 70% ethanol and let dry. One clean familiar object and one clean novel object were placed in the arena, where the two identical objects had been located during in the familiarization phase. 60-min after the end of the familiarization session, each subject was returned to its open field for a 5-min recognition test, during which time it was allowed to freely explore the familiar object and the novel object. The familiarization session and the recognition test were recorded and scored with Ethovision XT videotracking software (Version 9.0, Noldus Information Technologies, Leesburg, VA). Object investigation was defined as time spent sniffing the object when the nose was oriented toward the object and the nose-object distance was 2-cm or less. Recognition memory was defined as spending significantly more time sniffing the novel object compared to the familiar object via a Student's paired t-test. Total time spent sniffing both objects was used as a measure of general exploration. Time spent sniffing two identical objects during the familiarization phase confirmed the lack of an innate side bias. Objects used were plastic toys: a small soft plastic orange safety cone and a hard plastic magnetic cone with ribbed sides, as previously described (Gompers et al., 2017; Gulinello et al., 2018) .",

Training consisted of a 2-min acclimation period followed by three tone-shock (CS-US) pairings (80 dB tone, duration 30-s; 0.5 mA footshock, duration 1 s; intershock interval 90-s) and a 2.5-min period, during which no stimuli were presented. The environment was well lit (\u223c100 lx), with a stainless steel grid floor and swabbed with almond odor cue (prepared from almond extract; McCormick; 1:100 dilution). A 5-min test of contextual fear conditioning was performed 24-hr after training, in the absence of the tone and footshock, but in the presence of 100 lx overhead lighting, almond odor and chamber cues identical to those used on the training day. Cued fear conditioning, conducted 48-hr after training, was assessed in a novel environment with distinct visual, tactile and orange olfactory cues. Overhead lighting was turned off. The cued test consisted of a 3-min acclimation period followed by a 3-min presentation of the tone CS and a 90-s exploration period.

Statistical testing was performed using established assay-specific methods, including Student's t-test for single parameter comparisons between genotypes, and one-way or two-way repeatedmeasures ANOVA for comparisons across time points (e.g., development, pre-and post-fear conditioning, open field and beam walking). All significance levels were set at p < 0.05 and all t-tests were twotailed. Groups sizes were chosen based on past experience and power analyses (Sukoff Rizzo and Silverman, 2016). Significant ANOVAs were followed by Bonferroni-Dunn posthoc testing. Behavioral analysis passed distribution normality tests, was collected using continuous variables and thus was analyzed via parametric analysis in all assays. For all behavioral analyses, variances were similar between groups and data points within 2 standard deviations of the mean were included in analysis. Table 1 shows delayed early physical development and neurological reflexes in various parameters in Snord116+/\u2212 compared to Snord116+/+ littermates. All subjects gained weight and grew in length over time (weight: F 2,50 = 120.7, p < 0.0001 and length: F 2,50 = 67.51, p < 0.0001). However, Snord116+/\u2212 mice weighed less at all three time points collected (F 1,25 = 26.55, p < 0.0001, Bonferroni-Dunn posthoc) and were shorter by total length (body plus tail) at PND 12 and 14 (F 1,25 = 13.84, p < 0.002, Bonferroni-Dunn posthoc). Snord116+/\u2212 mice also had smaller head widths at all three time points (F 1,25 = 13.84, p < 0.001, Bonferroni-Dunn posthoc).

                "text": "These cognitive behavioral deficiencies are intriguing and lend suggestions toward the role of the well-studied underlying neural circuitry. OLM and NOR both heavily rely on the spontaneous exploratory behavior of rodents towards objects (Bevins and Besheer, 2006; Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988; Vogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014) . Broadly, neuroanatomical substrates implicated in these functional outcomes include the hippocampus and its supporting limbic regions, such as the medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices. In fact, an array of lesions in limbic sites connected with the hippocampus did not disrupt performance on a 15-min retention test of NOR while similar studies in OLM revealed impairments from lesions of the fornix and the cingulate cortex but not the medial prefrontal cortex (Ennaceur, Neave, & Aggleton, 1997) . The amygdala is important for associating objects or spatial relationships with positive or aversive outcomes and appears to mediate fear responses to novel stimuli or neophobia (Ennaceur, Michalikova, & Chazot, 2009) . For example, rodents with amygdala lesions show attenuated neophobia for novel food (Burns, Annett, Kelley, Everitt, & Robbins, 1996) . Moreover, a rich literature of lesion work indicated that specific but different brain regions appear to regulate cued versus contextual fear conditioning. Although the responses of behavioral freezing elicited by contextual and cued fear conditioning are identical, the processing demands underlying the two forms of fear conditioning are different. The preponderance of the evidence supports the hypothesis that primary sensory information from the auditory thalamus into the lateral amygdala mediate cued fear conditioning (Phillips and LeDoux, 1992; while contextual fear conditioning require both the amygdala and the hippocampus (Phillips and LeDoux, 1995; Maren and Holt, 2000) . Given our reported impairments in Snord116+/\u2212 mice using novelty-based tasks and cued fear conditioning, we hypothesize a broad range of neural substrates underlying the dysfunction. A study by Lassi, Priano et al. (2016) also supports our suggestion of subcortical and limbic anomalies with evidence of morphological changes measured by structal MRI. Moreover, they discovered a major reduction in the size of the hippocampus in Snord116+/\u2212 mice and PWS patients (Lassi, Priano, et al., 2016) .",

We extended these phenotypic outcomes by also quantifying smaller body lengths and smaller head circumferences. Development of walking measured by the animals' skills to traverse outward of a circle disk was delayed in the Snord116+/\u2212 mice. Interestingly, other standard neonatal neurological reflexes such as negative geotaxis, righting reflex and cliff aversion remained intact. We confirmed that the cognitive deficits observed in Snord116+/\u2212 mice were not the result of confounding motor hypoactivity, despite the substantial growth delays in the first 2 weeks of postnatal life. In extension of earlier work, we also examined anxiety-related phenotypes. Earlier characterization studies had reported an increased anxiety-like phenotype measured by increased ratio of time spent in the closed arm by the Snord116+/\u2212 mice (Ding et al., 2008) . We corroborated this finding by the standard measure of anxiety-like behavior on the plusmaze of percent time spent on the open arm. While a mild anxiety-like phenotype was observed on the elevated plus-maze, it was not supported by data from the light-dark conflict task nor the center time in the open field, which suggested to us a very mild anxiety-like phenotype which probably did not confound learning and memory results.",

Other in vivo model systems of PWS deleted the entire critical imprinting center and reported low locomotor abilities and impairments in the frontal cortical dependent five choice serial reaction time task (Relkovic et al., 2010) . Given the number of genes in the critical imprinting region, other models were generated that focused on mutations of single paternally expressed genes. Necdin (Ndn) null mutants were the first to be generated and characterized since Necdin protein is postulated to govern the permanent arrest of cell growth of post-mitotic neurons during development. Ndn mutant mouse models were generated from multiple Fig. 5 . Anxiety-like behavioral testing illustrated inconsistent and confounded behavioral phenotypes in Snord116+/\u2212 mice. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed in two gold standard assays: elevated plus-maze and light \u2194 dark conflict. (A) During the elevated plus-maze, percent time spent on the open arm and (B) number of total arm entries (open + closed) were fewer in Snord116+/\u2212 mice as compared to Snord116+/ +.

The other gene in the region that is highly homologous to Ndn, paternally expressed and has multiple key cell cycle regulatory functions is Magel2. Magel2 mutant mice have disrupted circadian rhythm and reduced brain volumes however relatively normal motor and learning abilities (Fountain, Tao, Chen, Yin, & Schaaf, 2017; Kozlov et al., 2007; Mercer et al., 2009) in contrast to the learning and memory deficits reported herein.",

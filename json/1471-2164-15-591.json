    "abstract": "Background: Corals represent symbiotic meta-organisms that require harmonization among the coral animal, photosynthetic zooxanthellae and associated microbes to survive environmental stresses. We investigated integrated-responses among coral and zooxanthellae in the scleractinian coral Acropora formosa in response to an emerging marine pollutant, the munitions constituent, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5 triazine (RDX; 5 day exposures to 0 (control), 0.5, 0.9, 1.8, 3.7, and 7.2 mg/L, measured in seawater). Results: RDX accumulated readily in coral soft tissues with bioconcentration factors ranging from 1.1 to 1.5. Next-generation sequencing of a normalized meta-transcriptomic library developed for the eukaryotic components of the A. formosa coral holobiont was leveraged to conduct microarray-based global transcript expression analysis of integrated coral/zooxanthellae responses to the RDX exposure. Total differentially expressed transcripts (DET) increased with increasing RDX exposure concentrations as did the proportion of zooxanthellae DET relative to the coral animal. Transcriptional responses in the coral demonstrated higher sensitivity to RDX compared to zooxanthellae where increased expression of gene transcripts coding xenobiotic detoxification mechanisms (i.e. cytochrome P450 and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family) were initiated at the lowest exposure concentration. Increased expression of these detoxification mechanisms was sustained at higher RDX concentrations as well as production of a physical barrier to exposure through a 40% increase in mucocyte density at the maximum RDX exposure. At and above the 1.8 mg/L exposure concentration, DET coding for genes involved in central energy metabolism, including photosynthesis, glycolysis and electron-transport functions, were decreased in zooxanthellae although preliminary data indicated that zooxanthellae densities were not affected. In contrast, significantly increased transcript expression for genes involved in cellular energy production including glycolysis and electron-transport pathways was observed in the coral animal. Conclusions: Transcriptional network analysis for central energy metabolism demonstrated highly correlated responses to RDX among the coral animal and zooxanthellae indicative of potential compensatory responses to lost photosynthetic potential within the holobiont. These observations underscore the potential for complex integrated responses to RDX exposure among species comprising the coral holobiont and highlight the need to understand holobiont-species interactions to accurately assess pollutant impacts.",

In marked contrast to previous sequencing efforts where coral genomic DNA was physically separated from that of zooxanthellae before analysis (i.e. [18] [19] [20] [21] ), we have characterized the protein-coding genes for the in situ holobiont including both coral and zooxanthellae (the metatranscriptome). This approach provided the ability to investigate global transcript expression within an intact symbiotic relationship between coral and zooxanthellae and thus enable the observation of interactive metabolism among species. A. formosa represents a useful coral model species that can be easily cultivated for use in controlled laboratory experimentation. Furthermore, A. formosa is ecologically and physiologically similar to other ecologically relevant Acropora species occurring in reef tracts around the world [22] .",

Given facility limitations and the requirement of this specific exposure chamber setup to maintain coral health, the experimental design included single exposure chambers containing five independent biological replicates. While single exposure chambers do not allow exclusion of variation in responses due to the exposure apparatus versus RDX exposure concentration, our principle concern was variation in biological responses at the individual level. Water quality, analytical chemistry and environmental conditions (methods and results described below) were closely monitored for consistency across all chambers to ensure variations in responses were due to the RDX exposure concentrations. We considered the individual coral fragments within each tank to represent true statistical replicates as has been described previously [23] [24] [25] only after careful empirical consideration through monitoring criteria contributing to statistical independence [26] and establishing dose-response relationships across the independent exposure aquaria (see Additional file 1 for detailed discussion).",

The strict taxonomy only included associations beginning at the phylogenetic class anthozoa to represent coral and algal symbionts only included Symbiodinium species as well as algal species recognized to have direct associations with coral, all based on primary literature search. For the inclusive taxonomy, all matches to animal species were included within the coral taxon and all plant and alga species were included within the algal symbiont taxon.

A post-hoc test including a parametric t-test (p = 0.05) and log 2 fold change cutoff of \u2265 1.5 was used to discern statistically significant differences in transcript expression for each RDX treatment relative to the control. Given the sense-antisense architecture of the microarray (see above), all differentially expressed microarray targets were examined to identify and eliminate microarray targets for which both the sense and antisense probes were differentially expressed. Microarray data are publicly available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/linking.html) under series accession GSE27624.",

Transcript expression levels were examined using DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treated total RNA from each of the three biological replicates used in microarray hybridizations (see Additional file 1 for methods). RT-qPCR data was analyzed with SDS 2.2 software package (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the \u0394\u0394CT method to quantify results as recommended by the developer. Assumptions inherent in the \u0394\u0394CT analysis were observed to be met sufficiently insuring accuracy of downstream analysis. Actin is recognized to have relatively stable expression independent of external stimuli in cnidarians [37] . One-way ANOVA on threshold cycle (Ct) values including control, 0.5, 1.8 and 7.2 mg/L exposures indicated that results are consistent with the assumption that actin expression remained consistent across treatments (p = 0.849), and was therefore selected as the internal normalizer for relative quantification (RQ). The characteristics of actin expression included low variability in relative quantification (RQ) and Ct value near the median of all RT-qPCR reactions. Fold change values (log 2 ) were calculated using RQ results where values represent transcript expression in RDX-treated coral relative to control coral. The 95% confidence interval (95% C.I.) was calculated around the mean relative expression for each RDX treatment. Confidence intervals that did not include unity were considered differentially expressed relative to controls as described in Rawat et al. [38] .",

Given the intimate bioenergetic connection between coral and zooxanthellae where photosynthesis by zooxanthellae provides as much as 95% of energy resources to the coral holobiont [15] , strong correlations in expression within the combined network was expected. Examples of highly correlated expression among species included: pyruvate kinase (XP_001700637) in zooxanthellae correlated with coral expression of transcripts involved in glycolysis (enolase 1 alpha, XP_001632906) and the electron transport chain (ATP synthase H + transporting mitochondrial F1 complex gamma, XP_001638994 and cytochrome C oxidase subunit II, NP_612824). Within the complete transcriptional network, RDX exposure elicited strong interspecies network connections for genes involved in a broad compliment of energy metabolism including: photosynthesis, glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, the citric acid cycle, electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure 6 , Additional file 2: Table S6 ). Although these results do not imply direct metabolic connections among these processes, the overall trend of the results indicates a dichotomous response among species where expression of gene transcripts related to nearly all aspects of energy metabolism are decreased in zooxanthellae which is correlated with a broad scale increase in expression of energy metabolism-related gene transcripts in the coral.",

These observations compared to our meta-transcriptome results (Figure 1) indicate that contribution to the metatranscriptome is not proportional to individual species transcriptome size, at least when comparing the eukaryotic contributors to the holobiont. This observation presents questions about individual-species transcriptomic expression as it relates to holobiont function. For example, given the limited percentage of genes attributed to zooxanthellae in the total sequencing pool, is the diversity of transcript expression reduced in zooxanthellae engaged in symbiotic relationships compared to free-living zooxanthellae? Given that the zooxanthellae are engaged in a symbiotic association within the coral animal, division of physiological labor among species may have contributed to a decreased proportional expression of genes within zooxanthellae. For example, if essential nutrients required in zooxanthellae are directly supplied by coral, the need to express the molecular machinery innate in zooxanthellae to capture or create these metabolites is negated, thus the need to express the genes in such pathways is reduced.",

At this concentration, RDX predominantly elicited differential expression of various components of metabolism in the coral animal including carbohydrate, energy, lipid, amino acid and glycan metabolism (Table 1) as well as increased expression of potential detoxification mechanisms (i.e. cytochrome P450, XP_001624662, and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, XP_001638304, Figure 5 ). Carbohydrate metabolism was the most represented second order KEGG term in the 0.5 mg/L treatment. All transcripts involved in carbohydrate metabolism had increased expression (Additional file 2: Table S6) XP_001179448) which was RT-qPCR-validated ( Figure 5 ). PCK1 has been observed to be the regulatory control point in the equilibrium reaction for glycolysis versus gluconeogenesis [45] in a mammalian model, and if this function is conserved in coral, the observed increase in PCK1 expression indicates inertia toward glycolysis. Assuming orthologous gene functions in corals to those observed in the literature, the transcript expression results suggest an equilibrium shift toward increased energy consumption in coral in response to low concentrations of RDX. Cytochrome P450 metabolism is a key facilitator for chemical detoxification via phase I xenobiotic biotransformation [46] and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 represents a xenobiotic phase II metabolism enzyme that conjugates sugar moieties to drugs and endogenous compounds increasing solubility and potential for elimination via excretion [47] . The qPCR validated increase in cytochrome P450 and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family transcriptexpression at this lowest RDX concentration ( Figure 5 ) indicates a likely response to metabolize bioaccumulated RDX. Although the bioaccumulation results suggest these mechanisms were not effective in decreasing RDX body burdens, such responses to chemicals where these detoxification mechanisms metabolize and mitigate toxicity would benefit both coral and the symbiotic zooxanthellae. Regarding the discussion of energy expenditures above, any induced detoxification mechanism requires energy which given the current observations may account for some component of the increased inertia toward energy consumption at the lowest RDX exposure concentration.",

For example, RT-qPCR validated reduced expression of UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (XP_971267) was observed with increasing RDX-exposure concentrations ( Figure 5 , Additional file 2: Table S6 ). UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase catalyzes reactions oxidizing the 6 carbon glucose substrate thereby reducing NAD + to NADH [50] which is a key energy-carrying molecule involved in cellular energy (ATP) production. Additionally, decreased expression of a gene transcript involved in metabolism of a 6 carbon intermediate substrate in the pentose phosphate pathway, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (XP_001627413, [51] ) was observed in the coral animal. In contrast to expression changes related to large 6 carbon carbohydrate substrates, expression of transcripts coding for genes that metabolize small 2-and 3-carbon substrates had increased expression in corals. For example, at the 1.8 mg/L exposure concentration, citrate synthase (XP_001641037), a highly conserved enzyme known to regulate the first reaction in the citric acid cycle converting the 2 carbon substrate acetyl CoA to citrate [52] had increased expression in coral (Additional file 2: Table S6 ). Additionally, the coral animal had increased transcript expression of enolase 1 alpha (XP_001632906), the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction converting the 3-carbon substrate phosphoglycerate to phospoenolpyruvate at the 7.2 mg/L exposure concentration. These results suggest that in the face of reduced carbon fixation and energy production resulting from RDX exposure in zooxanthellae, larger carbohydrate substrates (i.e. glucose and pentose) may be in short supply causing corals to increase expression of enzymes that can capture energy from intermediate 2 and 3 carbon metabolites to maintain energy budgets.",

Reduced expression of transcripts coding photosystem II protein (CAI58622, Additional file 2: Table S6 ) as well as RT-qPCR validated reductions in pyruvate kinase (XP_001700637), chloroplast light harvesting complex protein (AAW79366) and major facilitator superfamily (AAU87579) in algal symbionts ( Figure 5 ) are additional indicators of reduced potential for photosynthesis. Highly-stressed corals (particularly heat stressed) may eject zooxanthellae resulting in coral bleaching events [4] however, RDX exposure did not affect the density of algal symbionts (zooxanthallae) in coral tissue even at the highest RDX exposure concentration (Figure 7) . Therefore, the decrease in transcriptional expression for zooxanthellae-associated genes, including those involved in photosynthesis, was unlikely an artifact of a bleaching event. Photosynthesis by zooxanthellae supports as much as 95% of energy metabolism in the coral holobiont [15] . Increased expression of gene transcripts involved in electron transport chain-based ATP production were observed in the coral animal at both the 1.8 and the 7.2 mg/L RDX treatments likely representing a compensatory response to decreased cellular energy availability stemming from apparent decreased photosynthetic potential in zooxanthellae ( Figure 6 and Additional file 2: Table S6 ). Given these expression results, we hypothesize that RDX may impair photosynthetic activity in zooxanthellae thereby affecting energy availability for the overall coral holobiont. In future studies, measuring photosynthetic rates in the holobiont under RDX exposures could explicitly test this hypothesis.",

Corals have been observed to respond to a wide variety of environmental stressors such as crude oil, copper sulphate, mercury, increased sea surface temperature and decreased salinity by excreting copious amounts of mucus (see review in Brown and Bythell [13] ). When stimulated, coral tissue mucocytes discharge hydroscopic mucin into the seawater directly overlying the coral, creating an instantaneous large-volume expansion of mucus over a large surface area of coral tissue. This coral surface mucus layer has been observed to serve as a medium for nutrient assimilation, and is hypothesized to physically protect coral from chemical exposure by increasing the thickness of uncontaminated mucus in direct contact with the coral [13] . These preliminary results in conjunction with the observed increases in gene transcript expression for xenobiotic detoxification mechanisms are suggestive of both a physical and metabolic response by the coral animal to protect the holobiont in a chemical stressor exposure.",

Preliminary results indicate that holobiont bioaccumulation of RDX ( Figure 2 ) did not affect zooxanthellae density in the A. formosa holobiont (Figure 7) . RDX did however decrease transcript expression for genes involved in carbon fixation from CO 2 (carbonic anhydrase, AAM94169 and AAW79301, Additional file 2: Table S5 ), photosynthesis [photosystem II protein (CAI58622, Additional file 2: Table S6 ), chloroplast light harvesting complex protein (AAW79366, Figure 5 ) and major facilitator superfamily (AAU87579, Figure 5 )], and carbohydrate metabolism (pyruvate kinase, XP_ 001700637, Figure 5 ). Consistent with a decreased potential for photosynthetic energy production by zooxanthellae, coral animals decreased transcriptional expression of genes involved large 6 carbon carbohydrate metabolism (UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, XP_971267, Figure 5 and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase XP_ 001627413, Additional file 2: Table S6 ) in favor of increased expression for metabolism of smaller 2 and 3 carbon substrates in glycolysis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, XP_001179448, Figure 5 and enolase 1 alpha, XP_001632906, Additional file 2: Table S6 ) and the citric acid cycle (citrate synthase, XP_001641037, Additional file 2: Table S6 ). The transcriptional network generated for combined coral-zooxanthellae carbohydrate and energy metabolism showed strong correlations between the decreased expression of photosynthetic genes in zooxanthellae and increased transcript expression for genes involved in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain ( Figure 6 ). Although it is unlikely that these correlative network connections represent canonical feedback in metabolism among coral and zooxanthellae, they do indicate that the coral animal has highly sensitive and integrated transcriptional responses to the energetic potential of the zooxanthellae.",

                "text": "Our results indicate differential sensitivities and responses to the emerging marine pollutant RDX among species comprising the A. formosa coral holobiont. The coral animal had the most sensitive transcriptional response to RDX bioaccumulation (Figure 4 ) including increased expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism such as phase I and II xenobiotic detoxification pathways, cytochrome P450s and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family enzyme, respectively ( Figure 5 ) at the lowest RDX exposure level. These results in addition to preliminary data suggesting increased mucus production ( Figure 7 ) as a physical barrier to RDX exposure indicate that the coral animal may provide a sentinel response to protect the coral holobiont against chemical stressors. As RDX exposure concentrations/bioaccumulation increased, the proportion of differentially expressed transcripts from zooxanthellae dominated the holobiont transcriptional response (Figure 4 ). Transcriptional network ( Figure 6 ) and metabolic pathway analyses (Additional file 2: Table S6 ) suggest that the coral holobiont may have reduced potential for carbon fixation and energy production via photosynthesis in zooxanthellae. Observed compensatory increases in expression of glycolytic, citric acid cycle and electron transport pathways were observed likely to sustain energy (ATP) needs in the coral animal. These observations underscore the potential for complex integrated responses that occur among species comprising the coral holobiont and highlight the need to understand holobiont-species interactions to accurately ssess stressor impacts.",

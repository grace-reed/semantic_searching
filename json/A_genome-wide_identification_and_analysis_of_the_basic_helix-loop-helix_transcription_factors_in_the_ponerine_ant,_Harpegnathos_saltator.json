Result: In this study, we conducted a genome-wide survey for bHLH sequences, and identified 57 bHLH sequences encoded in complete genome sequence of the ponerine ant, Harpegnathos saltator. Phylogenetic analysis of the bHLH domain sequences classified these genes into 38 bHLH families with 23, 14, 10, 1, 8 and 1 members in group A, B, C, D, E and F, respectively. The number of PabHLHs (ponerine ant bHLHs) with introns is higher than many other insect species, and they are found to have introns with average lengths only inferior to those of pea aphid. In addition, two H. saltator bHLHs named PaCrp1 and PaSide locate on two separate contigs in the genome. Conclusions: A putative full set of PabHLH genes is comparable with other insect species and genes encoding Oligo, MyoRb and Fig\u03b1 were not found in genomes of all insect species of which bHLH family members have been identified. Moreover, in-family phylogenetic analyses indicate that the PabHLH genes are more closely related with Apis mellifera than others. The present study will serve as a solid foundation for further investigations into the structure and function of bHLH proteins in the regulation of H. saltator development.",

                "text": "Since the first basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif with DNA-binding and dimerization capabilities was reported [1] , numerous bHLH proteins have been found to be intimately involved in the regulation of a wide range of developmental processes, including neurogenesis, myogenesis, hematopoiesis, sex determination, gut development, cell differentiation and proliferation, as well as other essential processes in organisms ranging from yeast to humans [2, 3] . Hence, it is crucial that we understand the relationship of the various bHLH members, and be able to classify them into well-defined categories. These transcription factors, having a signature bHLH structural motif of approximately 60 amino acids and 19 highly conserved amino acids, consist of a basic region followed by two \u03b1-helices separated by a loop (HLH) region of variable length [2] . Working as a DNA-binding domain, the two basic domains dimerize to create a DNA interaction surface that recognizes the consensus hexanucleotide sequence, while the HLH domain interacts with other bHLH proteins to form homodimers or heterodimers between different bHLH family members [4, 5] .",

                "text": "In 1997, a phylogenetic analysis based on 122 bHLH sequences resulted in a natural classification of different bHLH transcription factors into four monophyletic protein groups named A, B, C and D in an attempt to functionally classify bHLH proteins [6] . Since more bHLH proteins had been identified in animals, plants and fungi, 44 orthologous families and six higher-order groups had been defined based on phylogenetic analyses to then available bHLH proteins [3, [6] [7] [8] . In addition, after the revision of Simionato et al. in 2007 , animal bHLH proteins are classified into 45 families, among which 22, 12, 7, 1, 2 and 1 families are included in high order groups A, B, C, D, E and F, respectively [9] . Briefly, groups A and B bHLH proteins are inclined to bind core DNA sequences typical of E boxes (CANNTG), in which group A recognizes and binds CACCTG or CAGCTG and group B recognizes and binds CACGTG or CATGTTG. Group A bHLH proteins mainly regulate neurogenesis, myogenesis and mesoderm formation, while group B ones mainly regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, sterol metabolism and adipocyte formation, and expression of glucose-responsive genes. Group C proteins, complex molecules with one or two PAS domains following the bHLH motif, tend to bind the core sequence of ACGTG or GCGTG. They are responsible for the regulation of midline and tracheal development, circadian rhythms, and for the activation of gene transcription in response to environmental toxins. Group D proteins correspond to bHLH proteins that are unable to bind DNA due to lack of a basic domain and act as antagonists of group A proteins. Group E proteins, mainly regulating embryonic segmentation, somitogenesis and organogenesis, bind preferentially to sequences referred to as N boxes (CACGCG or CAC GAG) and usually contain two characteristic domains named \"Orange\" and \"WRPW\" peptide in the carboxyl terminus. Group F proteins have the COE domain which has an additional domain involved in both dimerization and DNA binding. It has only one family, and mainly regulates head development and formation of olfactory sensory neurons [7, 10] .",

The alignment of all 57 PabHLH members is shown in Figure 1 , and the phylogenetic tree generated utilizing amino acids of 57 PabHLH motifs and 59 DmbHLH motifs is illustrated in Figure 2 . Both figures demonstrate that there are 23, 14, 10, 1, 8 and 1 PabHLH members in group A, B, C, D, E and F, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 1 that sites 23 and 64 of the bHLH motif are the most conserved sites among all PabHLH motifs. Besides, other ten sites, marked with asterisks on top of Figure 1 , are also highly conserved. Additionally, Figure 1 indicates that one PabHLH motif PaDys2 has quite special amino acids. Whereas the alignments of all identified bHLH motifs in other insect species have no gaps in the basic and helix 1 regions and only one major gap in the loop region [13, 14] , PaDys2 has two additional amino acids (T and P) in helix 1 region. The existence of these amino acids has created an additional gap among aligned PabHLH motifs (Figure 1 ), indicating certain difference between H. saltator and other insect species. From Figure 2 , we found two cases, like PaAse1 and PaAse2 which can form a monophyletic clade with ase from fruit fly, that the two PabHLHs group together with high statistical support to the exclusion of any other sequences and are often orthologs of a single fruit fly motif. This may reveal relatively recent duplications specific to the H. saltator. Besides these characters on Figure 2 , two PabHLHs, PaH1 and PaH2, can be related to two D. melanogaster families of orthologs. This may indicate that the diversity of those bHLHs found in both species occurred before the generation of duplications.",

Ortholog identification has much uncertainty because of the lack of absolute criterion that can be applied to decide whether two genes are orthologous or not [7] . Nevertheless, in our previous studies [13, 14] , in-group phylogenetic analysis was adopted to identify homologues for the unknown sequences that would form a monophyletic clade among themselves. Therefore, a more certain standard based on the criterion used by Ledent et al. was used in this study. That is, we defined bHLH families of orthologs as monophyletic groups which include sequences of a known family and whose monophyly is consistent with the different phylogenetic algorithms and supported by bootstrap values superior to 50 [7, 9, 17] .",

Protein sequences of the other 11 PabHLHs, namely PaAto, PaNet, PaSage, PaPxs, PaMnt2, PaCrp1, PaCrp2, PaClk1, PaDys1, PaDys2, and PaTgo, were not found in current database. The coding regions, intron location and length of 57 PabHLH motifs are listed in Table 2 . [14, 16] . In summary, the number of PabHLHs having introns is more than many other insect species, and they are found to have introns with average length only inferior to those of pea aphid. Moreover, PabHLHs have the shortest length of intron only higher than those of fruit fly and honey bee. PabHLH genes are more intron-dense than those of many other insects, indicating that H. saltator either gained introns at a faster rate or lost introns at a slower rate than other insects [29] . Previously hypothesized mechanisms of intron gain mainly involve intron transposition [30] , transposon insertion [31] , tandem genomic duplications [32] , intron transfer [33] , insertion of a Group II intron [30] , intron gain during double strand break repair [34] and intronization [35, 36] . Three previously hypothesized mechanisms of intron loss include Reverse Transcriptase-Mediated Intron Loss (RTMIL) [37] , Meiotic recombination [29] and genomic deletions [38] . Notably, the genome of H. saltator contains copies of specific transposable element (TE) families, which differs significantly with other species (i.e. Camponotus floridanus and A. mellifera have very few TEs) [22, 39] . We infer that there may be some relationships between the formation of intron in PabHLHs and TEs. Nevertheless, whether the more intron-dense introns are due to growing faster or losing slower needs further investigations.",

Therefore, further verification of our identified PabHLH members awaits expansion of H. saltator nucleotide sequence data and experimental cloning of the genuine PabHLH genes. It would thus be of particular interest to study whether the bHLH family members identified in H. saltator are expressed during various developmental processes and how their expression patterns may be related to those of other insect counterparts.",

This figure is comparable with 50, 51, 52, 54 and 59 bHLH members in the red flour beetle, honey bee, domestic silkworm, pea aphid and fruit fly, respectively (Table 3 ). According to Table 3 , all of these five insect species lack genes of families Oligo, MyoRb, and Fig\u03b1, and many of the families have the same number of genes, such as E12/E47, Ngn, Beta3, Net, Paraxis, Hand, PTFa, SCL, NSCL, SRC, Myc, SREBP, ARNT, Trh, HIF, Emc and COE. The fact that comparable number of bHLH families and similar orthologs were detected strongly suggests that, despite our analysis was made on a draft version of the H. saltator genome sequence, the set of PabHLH we retrieved is likely to be almost complete, and hence gives a highly accurate view of the bHLH repertoire of a ponerine ant. The major obvious difference, other than total genes, is the discrepancy of H/E (spl) family members. D. melanogaster have 11 to 12 H/E(spl) genes while other insects have 5 to 6. H. saltator has fewer genes in families ASCa, and Clock than D. melanogaster. It is conspicuous that H. saltator has one more gene in families Twist, Mnt, Max, USF, AHR and AP4 than most other insect species previously reported. Thirteen PabHLH families have more than one member (accounted for about 29% of the families), while in most other insects, families with more than one member are fewer (mean value 16%; range 13% to 20%). This suggests that some of the H. saltator bHLH genes have been originated through duplications. Moreover, a feature to be noted is that neither of the two families, namely Delilah and MyoRb, was found. Whether H. saltator does have fewer members of these families, or if it was due to incompleteness of the genome sequences remains for further exploitation. Therefore, it can be thought that additional bHLH members may be found after a newer and higher quality version of H. saltator genome sequences is released. We also executed several additional alignments consisting of only those bHLH sequences that belong to a particular family from 6 insect species above mentioned (Additional file 4). Based on these alignments, the infamily NJ trees were constructed (see Materials and methods) which has been rooted using a fruit fly bHLH sequence from the related family as outgroup.

Since the 45 representative bHLH sequences were mainly from mouse [9, 17] , it was more reasonable that we assign relationships according to phylogenetic analysis with DmbHLH members. Additionally, for having no corresponding orthologous genes in D. melanogaster, orthology of 8 bHLHs, namely PaAse1, PaMnt2, PaClk2,PaDys2, PaE(spl)1, PaE(spl)2 and PaE(spl)3, were defined by in-group phylogenetic analyses with A. mellifera bHLHs. The in-family phylogenetic analyses suggest that the PabHLH genes have closer phylogenetic relationships with A. mellifera than others. Among all PabHLH members, protein sequences of 11 PabHLH motifs were not found in any protein databases. We must however caution that we might have missed some bHLHs and/or that we might have included bHLH domains from some pseudogenes.

First, distance trees were constructed with the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm [44] using PAUP 4.0 Beta 10 [45] relying on the step matrix constructed from Dayhoff PAM 250 distance matrix by R. K. Kuzoff (http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/nfiles.html). Each PabHLH motif sequence was then used to conduct ingroup phylogenetic analysis with DmbHLH motif sequences. The in-group phylogenetic trees were performed with NJ and MP algorithms implemented in PAUP program, as well as with ML algorithm using the program TreePuzzle 5.2 [46] . The NJ tree was bootstrapped with 1,000 replicates to provide information about their statistical reliability, while the MP analysis was generated with heuristic search of 100 bootstrap replicates. For ML reconstruction, the parameters were set as follows: quartet-puzzling tree-search procedure, 25,000 puzzling steps and the substitution model set to Jones-Taylor-Thornton [47] . Other parameters were of default values. Additionally, all members from each bHLH family of ponerine ant, red flour beetle, honey bee, domestic silkworm, pea aphid and fruit fly were used to perform phylogenetic analyses, which were termed as in-family phylogenetic analysis because the bHLH motifs for a particular analysis were from the same bHLH family. Each in-family phylogenetic tree was rooted using fruit fly bHLH sequence from a different but related family.",

It should be noted that: a) coding regions of 18 PabHLH motifs have one intron, among which those of 6 PabHLH motifs have introns in the basic region, 7 have introns in the helix 1 region, 2 have introns in the loop region, and 3 have introns in the helix 2 region. b) Coding regions of 4 PabHLH motifs have two introns, all of which are in the basic and loop regions. Thus, altogether, coding regions of these 22 PabHLH motifs have 26 introns. In addition, 2 PabHLHs named PaCrp1 and PaSide locate on two separate contigs in the genome (Table 2). The longest intron in coding regions of PabHLH motifs is 7,943 bp (base pairs), the shortest one is only 82 bp, and the average length of introns is 1,391 bp.

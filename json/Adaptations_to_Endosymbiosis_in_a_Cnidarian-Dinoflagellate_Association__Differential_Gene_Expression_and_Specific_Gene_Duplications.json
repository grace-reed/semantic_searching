Dysfunction and collapse of symbiosis lead to bleaching (symbiont expulsion), which is responsible for the severe worldwide decline of coral reefs. Molecular signals are central to the stability of this partnership and are therefore closely related to coral health. To decipher inter-partner signaling, we developed genomic resources (cDNA library and microarrays) from the symbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Here we describe differential expression between symbiotic (also called zooxanthellate anemones) or aposymbiotic (also called bleached) A. viridis specimens, using microarray hybridizations and qPCR experiments. We mapped, for the first time, transcript abundance separately in the epidermal cell layer and the gastrodermal cells that host photosynthetic symbionts. Transcriptomic profiles showed large inter-individual variability, indicating that aposymbiosis could be induced by different pathways. We defined a restricted subset of 39 common genes that are characteristic of the symbiotic or aposymbiotic states. We demonstrated that transcription of many genes belonging to this set is specifically enhanced in the symbiotic cells (gastroderm). A model is proposed where the aposymbiotic and therefore heterotrophic state triggers vesicular trafficking, whereas the symbiotic and therefore autotrophic state favors metabolic exchanges between host and symbiont. Several genetic pathways were investigated in more detail: i) a key vitamin K-dependant process involved in the dinoflagellate-cnidarian recognition; ii) two cnidarian tissue-specific carbonic anhydrases involved in the carbon transfer from the environment to the intracellular symbionts; iii) host collagen synthesis, mostly supported by the symbiotic tissue. Further, we identified specific gene duplications and showed that the cnidarian-specific isoform was also up-regulated both in the symbiotic state and in the gastroderm. Our results thus offer new insight into the inter-partner signaling required for the physiological mechanisms of the symbiosis that is crucial for coral health.",

Anthozoans have a very simple body plan and are composed of two tissue layers, the epidermis and the gastroderm (also called ectoderm and endoderm, respectively [1] , Figure S1A ). They host their unicellular symbionts, also called zooxanthellae, inside vacuoles (symbiosomes) within the gastrodermal cell layer. Safely localized inside the animal host cells, the photosynthetic symbionts fix large quantities of carbon dioxide. Most of the reduced organic carbon produced is then translocated to the host as mobile compounds, such as glycerol, lipids and amino acids [2] . In return, the host provides suitable conditions for symbiont photosynthesis: inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus and inorganic carbon, as well as a favorable high light environment [2] .",

To prevent possible cellular damage resulting from photosynthesis-induced hyperoxia, both partners also express a high diversity of antioxidant enzymes, including catalases, peroxidases and superoxide dismutases (SODs), [7] [8] [9] .

The establishment and maintenance of this partnership must therefore be dependent on intimate molecular communications between the partners, including recognition and tolerance of symbionts, as well as adaptations for mutual transport and exchange of nutritional resources. A small number of candidate genes for this molecular dialogue has been proposed, including CAs and the cell adhesion protein Sym32 [10, 12, 13] . These have so far been examined by targeted protein analyses (for review, see [14] ). Large-scale gene expression studies have tended to highlight a modulation of the host transcriptome, in particular genes involved in cell adhesion, lipid metabolism, cell cycle regulation, or cell death [15] [16] [17] . While most transcriptomic approaches have been performed in symbiotic cnidarians under thermal stress, imposed in order to understand the molecular and cellular basis of the early events leading to bleaching [18, 19] , we rather focused our present experimental approach on two stable states: symbiotic and aposymbiotic individuals.",

Concerted DNA microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analyses outlined characteristic gene expression signatures for the symbiotic and aposymbiotic states. Among newly identified genes, some appeared to result from anthozoan-specific gene duplications. Analyses of tissuespecific expression demonstrated that most of the host genes involved in symbiotic interactions are preferentially expressed in the gastroderm (i.e. the zooxanthellate tissue layer). We detailed several genetic regulatory pathways involved in dinoflagellatecnidarian recognition, carbon transfer to the intracellular symbionts and mesoglea constitution.

Although gene locus number per nucleus is assumed to remain constant for a given species, dinoflagellates have been shown to undergo gene specific amplifications [21, 22] . In Amphidinium carterae, the EF2 gene is present in tandem repeat contrary to APX [21] . Whilst the 3 A. viridis gene loci were present in a nearly 1:1 ratio in all specimens, in Symbiodinium the number of genes was relatively variable from one specimen to another despite the proximity of collection sites to one another. The SPS:APX ratio was around 1:1 in all specimens except for AS2 and AS6. EF2:APX and EF2:SPS ratios displayed strong polymorphism, likely due to EF2 variable gene amplification ( Figure S3A ). Gene copy numbers between A.viridis and its symbiont were also measured. Figure 1 shows the relative symbiont to host nucleus ratio for APX/COP-c SPS/COP-c and EF2/COP-c (similar results were obtained with RCC2 and NPC1, Figure S3B ). Whatever gene locus used, the pattern of symbiont to host cell ratio was reproducibly similar with ratios between aposymbiotic and symbiotic specimens ranging from 8.2610 22 (AS4 versus Sy1) to over 10 24 fold (AS6 versus Sy5).",

Insights into the physiological mechanisms that underlie healthy as well as stressed (or bleached) corals are thus critical to predict whether they will be able to adapt to and survive climate change.

This analysis ( Figure 2A ) showed unexpectedly high inter-individual variability of differential gene expression patterns within these 136 genes. Figure 2B shows the number of individual anemones for which a given gene is significantly differentially expressed between the SY and APO gene sets. For instance, only 8 SY genes were differentially expressed in all 11 anemones. Conversely, one APO gene (M = 20.63; B = 1.15) encoding for Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 was significantly differentially expressed in only 3 out of 11 anemones. To obtain an indication of the source of variability, we clustered the different anemones according to their expression. Different clustering parameters were tested and showed similar cluster trees; the most representative is shown underneath the heatmap (Figure 2A ). Whatever the parameters used, specimens Sy4 and Sy5, AS1 and AS2, and AS4 and AS5 always paired together. Remarkably, even if the anemones were maintained in the same culture conditions at least 3 months before sampling, such co-clustering seemed to correlate with their previous life history: different collection dates/areas for symbiotic specimens, and different bleaching causes for aposymbiotic sea anemones (see Material and Methods and Figure S2 ).

Anemones Sy3-5 were subjected to an 8uC temperature increase, and the expression of CA2-c, CA2-m and NPC2-D dropped by around 3 fold after 24 h and 48 h ( Figure 3 ). This result is interesting, considering their up-regulation in symbiotic individuals. This immediate response to environmental stress precedes symbiosis breakdown and thus strengthens support for the possible role of these 3 genes in endosymbiosis in A. viridis. ",

                "text": "As the two tissue layers can be separated in A. viridis, it is a powerful biological model for studying tissue-specific gene expression. We used two experimental designs to compare gastrodermal versus epidermal gene expression profiles ( Figure  S4 ). Firstly we directly hybridized the cDNAs of the two tissues against each other on the same array, and secondly we compared each tissue sample to the aposymbiotic AS6 reference and thus defined tissue expression profiles by transitivity. Only the genes with at least 1.50 fold increase in transcript abundance (M.0.59) in one tissue in both experiments were assigned as differentially expressed (Table 2, Tables S1 and S2 ). As expected, the expression of most Symbiodinium genes was restricted to the gastroderm. The Venn diagram in Figure 4 summarizes distribution of the 1,715 cnidarian-specific genes (prokaryote and zooxanthellae genes were excluded from the analysis) according to their gastrodermal (Ga), epidermal (Ep), and preferential symbiotic (SY) versus aposymbiotic (APO) expression. We further confirmed preferential expression of several genes in the different tissues using real-time quantitative PCR ( Figure 5 ). Taken together, microarray and qPCR results showed that many more A. viridis genes were preferentially expressed in the gastroderm (71%) than in the epidermis (29%). More interestingly, among the 17 genes which were both preferentially expressed in a given tissue and differentially regulated under symbiotic/aposymbiotic status, the large majority (12) were in fact up-regulated within the gastroderm of symbiotic anemones (i.e. the zooxanthellate tissue). This suggests that the presence of symbionts directly modulates the gene expression of their hosting gastrodermal cells. In addition, out of these 12 genes, 9 belong to the Kern subset of genes, supporting the importance of this gene set in inter-partner communication and regulation ( Figure 5 and Table 2 ). Hence, we have identified different categories of genes potentially involved in sequential aspects of symbiosis, and showed for the first time that the animal tissue-specific molecular response to the presence/absence of zooxanthellae was restricted almost entirely to preferential expression of genes within the compart- ment hosting the symbionts. These results support the crucial role of the gastroderm in this symbiotic interaction. The gastroderm-specific gene expression disclosed interesting hallmarks. Carbonic anhydrases are primordial enzymes necessary for the transport of inorganic carbon through biological membranes. Two isoforms were identified in our library and had increased transcript abundance in zooxanthellate anemones. Based on their respective protein signatures and blast homology, one isoform (Av_CA2-c, Kern # 3) is cytoplasmic whereas the other isoform (Av_CA2-m, Kern # 5) probably localizes to the outer plasma membrane, since it contains a signal peptide sequence as well as a trans-membrane and GPI anchor domains at its NH 2 and COOH termini, respectively. The cytoplasmic CA2 was equally distributed in the two compartments, but the membrane-anchored CA2 was principally expressed in the gastroderm ( Figure 5 ). Another interesting finding on the tissue distribution of gene expression was that collagen biosynthesis was broadly under the control of the gastroderm. In cnidarians, fibrillar collagen genes were recently shown to be much more represented than first expected from bilaterian evolutionary comparisons, with 8 different genes present in the genome of N. vectensis [24] . In A. viridis, we found 13 different cDNAs corresponding to portions of the N. vectensis homologs. Additionally, we monitored the expression of 5 genes regulating the post-translational processing of collagen synthesis. Interestingly, 14 of these cDNAs showed increased transcript abundance in the gastroderm ( Table 2 ). The mesoglea, the acellular layer between epidermis and gastroderm, which mostly consists of collagen, may partly originate from the gastroderm in A. viridis. However, none of these genes showed differential expression between aposymbiotic and symbiotic states, except for Prolyl-4hydroxylase alpha. This enzyme is a key chaperone for the biosynthesis of collagen, catalyzing the hydroxylation of proline residues of procollagen chains necessary for their correct three dimensional folding [25] . Two different isoforms were identified in our sequence library and the expression of one of them (Kern # 14) was specifically enhanced in zooxanthellate anemones. Thus, in addition to showing that the gastroderm synthesized much of collagen fibers, our results infer that Symbiodinium may exert, directly or indirectly, post-translational control on collagen synthesis and modulate the formation of the mesoglea in A. viridis.",

We conducted phylogenetic analyses on the NPC2, Calumenin and Sym32 gene families in order to assign an evolutionary origin for each member. A. viridis isoforms present in our dataset were compared to their homologs in N.vectensis and other representative eukaryotes with a complete genome sequence. Both maximum likelihood ( Figure 6 and Figure 7A ) and Bayesian ( Figures S5, S6 , S7) methods gave very similar trees. In vertebrates, Calumenin belongs to the CREC gene family, which encompasses 5 members (CAB45, ERC-55, Reticulocalbin 1 and 3, and Calumenin) [26] . From phylogenetic analysis across metazoans ( Figure 6A ), 3 groups of homologs can be defined; the CAB45 homologs, the ERC55 homologs and the CALU (Calumenin, Reticulocalbin 1 and 3) homologs. Cnidarian homologs are found within these 3 groups, however additional cnidarian homologs (NvCALUa,c,f-h, AvCALUa,c) are also present outside the CALU and ERC55 groups, representing cnidarian specific CALU gene duplications.",

AvSym32 and AvPN are composed of 2 and 4 FasI domains, respectively. In N. Nematostella, there are also two comparable FasI-containing proteins; both are composed of 4 FasI domains. One corresponds to the PN homolog (NvPN) and the second, which we named Nv2Sym, is similar to a tandem duplication of the AvSym32 sequence with 262 FasI domains. In human, two related FasIcontaining proteins are characterized: the cognate Periostin (HsPN) and the ''Transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3'' precursor (HsBGH3), both with 4 FasI domains. As proteins did not have the same number of FasI domains, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis on the alignment of all single FasI domains in order to gain insight into the domain evolution of this protein family ( Figure 7A and Figure S7B ). Human and cnidarian PN genes likely evolved from a common ancestor while Hs_PN and Hs_BGH3 would have duplicated after the Cnidaria -Bilateria separation. Consequently, AvSym32 and Nv2Sym are cnidarianspecific genes. Whether a Sym32 version containing only 2 FasI domains is specific to symbiotic anthozoans remains to be clarified.",

                "text": "Many anthozoans rely on photosynthetic endosymbionts (mostly Symbiodinium sp.) to grow in oligotrophic environments. The symbiotic relationship involves regulatory crosstalk between partners that allows the association to persist. This interpartner communication includes: i) the recognition of the partners, ii) the ability of symbionts to colonize host cells without being rejected by the host immune system, iii) the regulation of symbiont population, and iv) adaptations for mutual transport and exchange of nutritional resources [27] . In order to identify the genes potentially involved in the molecular dialog supporting this endosymbiosis, we used a microarray approach to compare the gene expression profiles of 11 A. viridis anemones representative of the symbiotic and the aposymbiotic states. We identified a subset of A. viridis genes, which we named ''Kern'', characteristic of the symbiotic (SY) and aposymbiotic (APO) states in the sense that they were preferentially expressed in symbiotic or aposymbiotic anemones. Consequently, the Kern genes are potentially important candidate genes for the maintenance of the symbiosis process. Since in A. viridis, the two tissue layers can be separated, we were also able to assign tissue-specific gene expression. Many genes or gene functions that were expressed more highly in symbiotic anemones Table S4 . The star points to the A.viridis isoform belonging to the Kern that is up-regulated in the gastrodem of symbiotic anemones. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1002187.g006",

                "text": "One of the first conclusions from our present model is that many genes that are present in higher abundance in the aposymbiotic state are associated with active vesicle trafficking, both in the endocytotic and secretory pathways, as opposed to the many membrane-bound proteins associated with cellular recognition and adhesion coded by genes in higher abundance in the symbiotic state (Table 1 and Figure 8 ). Under aposymbiotic conditions, transcription of several proteins controlling trafficking was markedly enhanced. These include TRAPPC2 and TRAPPC10 (Kern # 22 and 23), which are members of the TRAPP complexes that regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to post-golgi vesicular trafficking [28] , thus attesting for more active de novo biosynthesis in the aposymbiotic anemone than in the symbiotic host. As part of the same line of evidence, the highly differentially expressed gene AP-2 sigma-1 (Kern # 38) codes for a key protein in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicle [29] , implying increased endocytic trafficking. Among other aposymbiotic marker genes, HVCN1 and SLC30a (Kern # 26 & 36) are two ion channels shown to be present in phagosomes and late endosomal/ lysosomal vesicles, respectively [30, 31] . Of note, our dedicated array comprises several oligonucleotide probes for various rab mRNAs (including rab1a, 2a, 7a, 8a and 11a). Rab proteins have been shown to control vesicular trafficking in various species including symbiotic anemones [32] [33] [34] where the symbionts have been shown to detour host membrane trafficking resulting in failure of host lysosomes fuse with the symbiosomal membrane [34] . However, in our array results, none of the Av_rab genes were differentially expressed. This does not preclude a role of these Rab proteins in A. viridis symbiosis, as expression regulation may be at the translational level. Interestingly, the fact that vesicular trafficking appears to be much more active in aposymbiotic A. viridis corroborates with heterotrophy, which mostly rely on predation, digestion and de novo synthesis, as opposed to autotrophic symbiotic anemones, in which 60% of carbon flux is provided by symbionts [35] . Numerous studies have characterized glycerol, lipids and amino acids as the major mobile compounds transferred from the symbiont (reviewed in [2, 4] ). At the level of metabolism pathways, Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C; Kern # 28) had enhanced expression in aposymbiotic conditions. This enzyme catalyzes the rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis when pyruvate is used as the substrate. Two metabolic pathways can initiate gluconeogenesis: the PEPCK-C dependent pathway, which is fuelled by pyruvate (product of glycolysis), and the PEPCK-C independent pathway, which is fuelled by glycerol [36] . As glycerol is acquired from the symbiont, PEPCK-C is indeed expected to be down-regulated in the symbiotic state.",

Although mobile compounds have been identified using radioactive tracers [2] , compound transfer pathways from the symbiont remain to be characterized. Four Kern genes were involved in lipid processing pathways, LSD-2 (lipid storage droplet), SDR12 (terpenoid metabolism), 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1 and NPC2. These 4 genes were up-regulated in the symbiotic state (Kern # 2, 13, 15, 17 in Table 1 ). 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1 is responsible for fatty acid alpha-oxidation, a modification specific to fatty acids synthesized from chloroplastic organisms [37] . NPC2 (AvNPC2-D, Kern # 2) is among the most up-regulated genes, substantiating another study which noted that a NPC2 transcript was up-regulated in symbiotic Aiptasia pulchella anemones [38] . NPC2 acts in synergy with NPC1 in the transport of sterols (cholesterol) using the late The presence of symbionts activates the expression of calumenin and sym32 genes via an unknown mechanism. The CRS of the Sym32 protein is recognized as substrate by the activated vitamin K cycle (vitamin K is a cofactor produced from the photosynthetic organism) and in turn is c-carboxylated. Meanwhile, the Calumenin represses the VKOR protein, inhibiting the c-carboxylase. Two forms of Sym32 are thus expected to be produced from this pathway: the Glu-Sym32 and Gla-Sym32 electrophoretypes (likely corresponding to the two spots PI = 8.2 and PI = 7.9, respectively [51] ). Only Sym32 (PI = 8.2) is found to be associated with the symbiosome membrane, underlying a novel functionality for Sym32 and c-carboxylation. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1002187.g007 endosomal/lysosomal system [39] [40] [41] . Noticeably, NPC1 and NPC2 are preferentially expressed in the gastroderm (Table 2 ). Based on their tissue expression profile and symbiosis-related regulation, NPC1 and NPC2 appear to be major candidate genes for the transport in A. viridis of sterol compounds produced by Symbiodinium.",

In the coral Acropora millepora, one C3-like protein has been shown to localize in close association with the symbiosome in the gastroderm layer, supporting a role in recognition of Symbiodinium [44] . In sea anemones, there are three C3 isoforms in the non-symbiotic N. vectensis genome and a minimum of four different C3 isoforms were identified in the A. viridis EST dataset (PG and CS, personal communication). We monitored the expression of two of these: AvC3-1 and AvC3-2. Although AvC3-1 expression was mainly restricted to the gastroderm and may well represent the A. millepora functional homolog, no differential expression was observed between symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones (validated by qPCR, Figure 5 ). On the other hand, AvC3-2 (Kern # 37) was expressed in both tissue layers, but was strongly repressed in the presence of symbionts. The functional divergence between the different C3 (Table 1) , each gene product from the Kern set was assigned a specific sub-cellular compartment or secretion pathway: ExtCell; Extra Cellular milieu; Cyt, Cytosol; Nu, Nucleus; TGN, Trans Golgi Network; ER, Endoplasmic reticulum; LD, Lipid droplets; Mit, Mitochondrion; Per, Peroxisome; Lys, Lysosome; Phag, Phagosome; EE, Early Endosome; RE, Recycling Endosome; LE, Late Endosome; Zoox, Zooxanthellae. The left and right moieties of the diagram show genes with increase transcript abundance in aposymbiotic and symbiotic states, respectively. Circles (aposymbiotic), barrels (solute carrier), and hexagons (symbiotic) represent gene expression specific to epidermis (E, dark grey), gastroderm (G, light grey) or both (E&G, white). Trans-membrane domains are shown by appendages. Each gene number has the corresponding name indicated in the list on the right. Gene products in dashed grey are candidate proteins that could potentially (hypothetic) be present at the perisymbiotic space. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1002187.g008",

                "text": "Another recognition process that we uncovered in our experiment is related to the vitamin K-dependent (VKD) ccarboxylation of Sym32, under the control of the Calumenin protein. In human, Calumenin proteins are composed of 6 to 7 Ca 2+ binding EF hand domains. They are principally present in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) due to specific ER retention motifs at their COOH termini [26, 45, 46] . Their differences in function are unclear, but they are associated with Ca 2+ dependent processes, especially with post-translational VKD c-carboxylation of several proteins [26] . The increase of intracellular vitamin K (a cofactor produced from plant) activates two proteins conserved throughout metazoans: Vitamin K1 2,3-Epoxide Reductase (VKOR) and c-Carboxylase. The latter recognizes carboxylase recognition sites (CRS) in newly synthesized proteins and adds a CO 2 group to adjacent glutamic acid (Glu) residues resulting in the production of c-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing proteins [47, 48] . VKD proteins have been mainly explored in mammals and include bone marrow proteins such as Osteocalcin, Matrix Gla Protein and Periostin (PN) which are involved in bone formation [49] . The vitamin K cycle is itself under the negative control of Calumenin [26, 46] ( Figure 7B ). In A. viridis, the Calumenin homolog AvCALU-a (Kern # 1) was the most upregulated gene of the symbiotic state detected in the microarray experiments ( Table 1) . It is also preferentially expressed in gastrodermal cells. It contains an ER retention motif and is thus expected to down-regulate the VKD c-carboxylation in the ER of zooxanthellate A. viridis cells.",

In A. viridis, the Sym32 ortholog (AvSym32, Kern # 4) is up-regulated by more than 40 fold in the symbiotic state and is principally expressed in the gastroderm ( Figure 5 , Table 1 and Table 2 ). Both AeSym32 and AvSym32 are composed of two fasciclin I (FasI) domains (Figure 7) , functionally associated with cell-cell recognition and thus potentially involved in anemone-zooxanthellae interaction [13, 51] . Importantly, in both sea anemones, the first FasI domain of Sym32 is highly similar in sequence to the first FasI domain of PN, and contains a sequence motif very similar to the CRS domain of PN characterized in vertebrates [49] . Sym32 is thus an implicit substrate for the c-Carboxylase in sea anemones. As part of the same line of evidence, a 2D immunoblot of zooxanthellate A. elegantissima extract hybridized with an anti-Sym32 antibody showed the presence of two spots of 32 KDa, one at PI = 7.9 and the other at PI = 8.2 [51] . Such a PI difference for the same protein could very well correspond to difference between Glu and Gla containing Sym32 proteins since c-carboxyglutamic acid decreases the PI of a protein (e.g. [52] ). However, analysis of freshly isolated Symbiodinium (FIZ, where most of the perisymbiosomal membrane -of host origin -remains attached around the isolated Symbiodinium cell) of A. elegantissima showed the disappearance of the PI = 7.9 spot in favor of the PI = 8.2 spot [13] . These experiments infer that the Glu-Sym32 protein would localize to the perisymbiotic membrane. Since c-carboxyglutamic acid residues have been shown to modify the three dimensional structure and Ca 2+ binding affinity, Glu-Sym32 and Gla-Sym32 would show different ligand properties [53] . Moreover, up-regulation of Calumenin shown in our work suggests an inhibition of c-carboxylation which would favor the production of Glu-Sym32 in zooxanthellate A. viridis cells ( Figure 7B) . Thus, the vitamin K-dependent c-carboxylation of Sym32, with its effect on interpartner recognition and the symbiotic process, is definitively a pathway that should be investigated.",

                "text": "The photosynthetic symbionts are separated from the surrounding seawater by several host membranes: membranes of the epidermal cell layer, the collagenous basal membrane, gastrodermal cells, and perisymbiotic vesicles. The main source of inorganic carbon (Ci) for photosynthesis is seawater bicarbonate (HCO 3 2 ), which implies transport of exogenous inorganic carbon through these layers of animal tissue [5, 54] . In seawater (pH 8.2), most inorganic carbon is in the form of HCO 3 2 , a form that needs carrier-mediation to cross membranes, and that is not readily converted to CO 2 in the absence of enzymatic action [55, 56] . The currently accepted model for external Ci uptake by the host involves an H + -ATPase acidifying the boundary layer where bicarbonate is converted to CO 2 by an external (likely membranebound) carbonic anhydrase isoform [3] . The uncharged CO molecule then diffuses into the epidermal cell following the concentration gradient created by the extrusion of H + in the external medium. Once in the animal cytoplasm, CO 2 is equilibrated with HCO 3 2 according to the intracellular pH by another CA isoform, which prevents back-diffusion of CO 2 (for review see [3] ). The mechanism of transport of Ci through the other membranes to the symbionts is currently debated (for reviews, see [5, 57, 58] ). However, previous works have highlighted the role of a CA localized on the perisymbiotic [59] or algal membrane [60] .",

We suggest that AvCA2-c catalyzes the intracellular reversible hydration/dehydration of CO 2 into HCO 3 2 to facilitate the transport of CO 2 through the membranes and cells (Figure 8 ). AvCA2-m is a membrane-bound isoform specifically expressed in the gastrodermal layer of anemones where symbionts are located. This membrane-bound isoform can be located either on the plasma membrane of the gastrodermal cells, or on the perisymbiotic membrane surrounding the symbiont. In the first case, AvCA2-m would favor the transfer of CO 2 from one cell layer to another by preventing back-diffusion of CO 2 through membranes. In the second case, this isoform would catalyze the final conversion of HCO 3 2 into CO 2 for photosynthetic needs. It should be noted that, since in N. vectensis at least six different isoforms of carbonic anhydrases have been identified (AM and D. Zoccola, personal communication), other A. viridis CA isoforms are expected to contribute in the Ci transport from seawater to Symbiodinium.",

For most of the past century, gas molecules such as CO 2 were presumed to cross biological membranes merely by diffusing through the lipid phase. This view was challenged recently by studies demonstrating the permeability of water channel aquaporins and certain Rh-family members to CO 2 [62] [63] [64] . The physiological function of those channels for CO 2 transport seems to be particularly important since, for instance, one Rh protein (RhAG) accounts for up to 50% of the CO 2 transport of human red blood cells [65] . In A. viridis, we identified two RhAG isoforms, one of which (Av_RhAG1) is preferentially expressed in the gastroderm of zooxanthellate anemones ( Table 2) . We suggest that these proteins could have a role within the holobiont to facilitate CO 2 uptake, possibly in conjunction with the membrane-bound CA2. In human erythrocytes, RhAG and CA2 are part of the same Band 3 multiprotein complex involved in anion exchanges [66, 67] . It is worth mentioning that a role of Av_RhAG1 in NH transport is equally valid, as in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, ammonium resulting from host metabolism is not excreted into the surrounding water but is immediately re-assimilated by the algae, either through diffusion or by a transporter, and then recycled [4, 68] .",

Moreover, at the transcriptional level, we have shown for several cases that expression of one isoform among the duplicated gene copies was specifically up-regulated both in the gastroderm and in the presence of symbionts. Thus, we suggest that these neofunctionalizations would be associated with the physiological constraints of endosymbiosis and would be tuned to the presence of zooxanthellae by transcriptional control. It is not known how such control is exerted or whether such gene regulation is restricted to symbiotic cnidarians. Comparative tissue expression of the different orthologs in non-symbiotic cnidarians, such as N. vectensis, would provide insight into the adaptive origin of symbiosis.",

Indeed, bleaching can be caused by a multitude of environmental stressors including changes in seawater temperature, salinity, ultraviolet radiation, increased sedimentation, nutrients and pollutants [70] . In response to different stresses, the host-associated microbiota is greatly and specifically modified within the whole holobiont (i.e. the community composed of cnidarian host, dinoflagellates and associated microbes) [71] .",

However, our results on the gene copy numbers of only 3 genes (EF2, SPS and APX) showed unexpected high polymorphism in the Symbiodinium hosted by anemones collected from neighboring location. In addition, we showed that the abundance of zooxanthellae per host cell is variable within our set of symbiotic sea anemones. Thus, variation in the associated microbiota or in Symbiodinium sub-clades may have stable extended effects on the host gene expression profile. This underlines that, although the term ''bleached'' defines one visual phenotype resulting from various responses, it can result from diverse expression profiles, and probably from various conditions of aposymbiosis. Indeed, not all bleached cnidarians die.",

Additionally, since sea anemones are noncalcifying anthozoans, they allow the study of symbiosis-associated processes outside the cross-regulatory pathways of mineralization found in corals. It would be of interest, using the same array technique, to monitor the kinetics of the specific gene expression response to one or combination of different environmental stressors. In addition to giving a transcriptional map of the genespecific response to stress, it would highlight whether different bleaching expression profiles are fixed in time or whether they tend to stabilize at a unique Kern profile after an adaptation period. Moreover, the unique amenability of A. viridis to separate the ectoderm from the endoderm will permit us to partition the scope of the environmental response in the cellular layer hosting the symbionts (gastroderm) and in the tissue in direct contact to the milieu (epidermis).",

GPI anchors were predicted with PredGPI (http://gpcr.biocomp.unibo.it/predgpi). Other Domains were inferred from PFAM (pfam.sanger.ac.uk). Blast analysis tools used were from NCBI (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).Functionnal annotation of the A. viridis EST dataset (GO annotations) has been performed using Blast2GO [20] . Statistical assessment of annotation differences between SY-genes (test group) and APO-genes (reference group) was performed using the Gossip package [76] , that employs Fisher's Exact Test to estimate the significance of associations between two categorical variables.Sequence alignments were performed using MultAlin [77] and ClustalW with Blosum62 default parameters. Alignments were optimized manually using the 2 computer generated alignments as a model. Using the segment of the sequence alignment conserved in all sequences (bordered by the bar above alignments in Figures  S5, S6, S7 ), the best-fitted substitution model was evaluated using ProtTest [78] . Using parameters indicated in the Figure legend of each alignment tree, a Maximum Likelihood tree was determined using phyML and branches support were calculated using aLRT [79] . Alternatively, Bayesian analysis using MrBayes 3-1.2 (mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu) was conducted with the following settings: fixed rate amino acid model was set to mixed (prset aamodelpr = mixed) and proportion of invariable sites model was combined with the Gamma model (lset rates = invgamma).

Schematic section through an A. viridis polyp, showing the two tissues (compartments) composing the animal: the epidermis (''E'') and the gastroderm hosting the photosynthetic zooxanthellae (''G''). B. The 2,000 genes compiled on the oligoarray were selected from an A. viridis clustered and annotated EST dataset according to putative participation in symbiotic processes. Genes were classified by GO terms according to Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cellular Components. Histogram values are given as the percentage of total within each GO category. C. Significant GO terms enrichment between the 136 annotated genes identified as up-regulated in the symbiotic state (SY genes; test group) and up-regulated in the aposymbiotic state (APO genes; reference group).

Total genomic DNA was extracted from the 11 sea anemones tentacles (Sy1-5 and AS1-6), a dissected epidermal tissue (Ep) and culture Symbiodinium (CZ). The gDNAs were used as template for real-time quantitative PCR with primers specific for the Symbiodinium EF2, APX and SPS genes and the A. viridis COP-c, RCC2 and NPC1 genes. A. Comparison of the relative A.viridis gene loci number (top panel) shows that most gene ratios are around 1:1 in the different individuals whereas relative Symbiodinium gene loci number (bottom panel) shows variable numbers, essentially due to variation in the EF2 loci number. B. Comparative gene ratio between Symbiodinium SPS, APX and EF2 versus A.viridis RCC2 (top panel) and NPC1 (bottom panel). Both histograms confirm the symbiotic and aposymbiotic state of the specimen used in this study, individual showing similar pattern than in Figure 1 .

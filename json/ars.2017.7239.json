However, CO also plays essential physiological roles (35) as a gasotransmitter (50) [or small-molecule signaling agent (18) ]. CO is endogenously produced by heme oxygenase that catalyzes the degradation of heme, liberating CO, which then modulates key anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and cytoprotective effects. However, the handling and health risks associated with administering CO gas have prompted the design and administration of CO-releasing molecules (CORMs), predominantly metal carbonyl compounds, allowing substantial advances in the biochemistry and physiology of CO (8, 37) . Diverse CORMs differ in structure, kinetics, and in CO release mechanisms (70) .",

The emerging picture is of a pleiotropic nature, with multiple targets that functionally converge on adverse bioenergetic effects hindering bacterial growth. As a former Invited Forum Editor and Author of Antioxidant & Redox Signaling, I clearly understand and adhere to the journal's policy of scientific excellence. In this vein, I am confident that the work by Wareham et al. fits those standards while making a remarkable scientific contribution. The few questions/concerns raised by the reviewers are not of enough scientific substance to reject sound work based on a substantial and comprehensive amount of evidence. The key issue from this work is that perturbations of the proton motive force elicited by CORM-401 are matched by enhanced respiration leading to membrane polarization, which in turn drives the uptake of CORM-401 by bacteria, poisoning them by its intracellular accumulation. This seminal effect facilitates the intracellular action of CORM-401 on multiple targets leading to growth arrest. Therefore, in the interests of science, I take full responsibility to rescue this work from rejection.",

The article investigates the mechanism of action of a CO-releasing molecule and describes biochemical, cellular bioenergetic, and transcriptional responses of E. coli to CORM-401. The innovation of the article is that these data are the first to describe the pharmacodynamics of this second-generation CORM. The findings suggest a pleiotropic mechanism of action, which includes disruption of respiratory chain components and of membrane integrity in terms of ion transport/homeostasis. It is likely that the disruption of these two biological functions is linked. One of the referees questions the demonstration that CORM-401 stimulates respiration.

In defined (Evans) growth medium, at physiological temperature (37\u00b0C) and pH (7.4), 2.5 mol equivalent of CO was released to myoglobin with a half-time of 4.5 min. In 0.1 M KPi buffer at 37\u00b0C, the half-time was 5 min and the yield of CO was 2.4 mol/mol; at 20\u00b0C, the rate was slower ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ; Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/ars). Fayad-Kobeissi et al. (16) reported that the yield of CO increased as the myoglobin:CORM-401 ratio increased, with 2.6 mol observed at a ratio of 5:1.

I have closely read the article and the reviewers' comments. My overall reaction is that the article is sound, and I advise that a decision be made to accept the article. I was surprised by the outcome. I would have predicted that toxicity was mediated by the usual action of CO. The loss of viability in Figure 2 was enough to alert me that I was wrong. This is nice work. A reviewer requested in vivo analysis, but because these compounds impact host cells, a study of CORM-401 impact in host animals would be large and complex. Another wrote: authors should determine O 2 consumption rate. This method is not new. Standard measurements of consumption ( Fig. 7B ) are problematic when rates are low. However, in Figure 7C and 7D, the reader can immediately see that CORM-401 and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone cause an increase in oxygen consumption, as evidenced by the lower steadystate oxygen level. The same reviewer wrote: oxygen consumption or even OCR could increase due to several processes other than respiration. I disagree with the reviewer's suggestion that nonrespiratory processes could accelerate oxygen consumption. E. coli lacks nonrespiratory enzymes that employ molecular oxygen as a substrate as this facultative bacterium must manage biosynthesis without oxygenases. Indeed, if one knocks out respiratory oxidases, oxygen consumption essentially ceases. Therefore, in the interests of science, I take full responsibility to rescue this work from rejection.",

Although inhibition of oxidase function may contribute to this distinction, this article reveals a multitude of effects on unrelated cellular functions. The control compounds again showed no deleterious effect on growth (Fig. 2B, inset) . To dissect the effect of CO gas and the CORM, we tested the addition of a CO-saturated solution on growth of cell cultures. Due to limitations of CO solubility and the undesirability of adding large volumes of gas solutions to cultures, a final concentration of 100 lM was used; no inhibition of growth was observed (data not shown), as shown before (69) .

Note, however, there is no useful correlation between biomass as assessed by optical density (light scattering) measurements ( Fig. 2A, B ) and viable cell numbers as assessed by colony counting after dilutions (Fig. 2C, D) . Light scattering certainly does not give information on the number of cells (17, 32) . Although glucose-grown cultures increased in total biomass at <100 lM CORM-401, viability on agar decreased at 500 lM after 2 h (Fig. 2C) . In contrast, cells grown on succinate ( Fig. 2D ) retained their viability on agar, even at 500 lM CORM-401, despite a lack of increase in biomass (Fig. 2B ). The apparent discrepancy in these two media might result, for example, from the clumping of cells in glucose (leading to an artifactually low cell count) or the ability of succinate-grown cells to retain viability after removal from the CORM, although being inhibited within the CORM-supplemented culture.",

CORMs-2 and -3 are accumulated by bacteria, as inferred from intracellular Ru concentrations (9, 27, 38) . Therefore, intracellular accumulation of CORM-401 was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) (38) . However, the metal in CORM-401 is Mn, itself a component of all cells, and so we sought elevated accumulation of this metal relative alone mimic the effects of CORM-401: these data thus point to features of the compound other than solely the liberated CO exerting inhibitory effects, with manganese, as opposed to ruthenium, appearing to be one crucial distinction. The work is a tour de force; in short, the action of CORM-401 is multifaceted and includes not only CO binding to respiratory oxidases but also manganese hyperaccumulation with effects on the homeostasis of other metals (such as zinc), ionic imbalance and loss of membrane integrity, and defined regulons. The extent of functional studies was questioned, yet the work is rich in a diversity of types of functional studies; these assays have demanded a high degree of technical skill in using a wide range of methodologies. Evidence that the compound stimulates respiration was questioned. However, bacterial respiration rates have been determined from measurements of oxygen concentrations and oxygen diffusion rates. Editorial comments note the lack of in vivo studies: it may be felt that ultimately the compound should be used in animal models of infection, but the modest effectiveness of this CORM as an antimicrobial agent suggests that animal studies are not justified (or perhaps ethical). Therefore, in the interests of science, I take full responsibility to rescue this work from rejection.",

In contrast, uptake by succinate-grown cells was monophasic, reaching *1.5 mM after 80 min (Fig. 3A , open circles). Thus, in glucose media, bacteria accumulate more CORM-401 ( Fig. 3A) . Since 500 lM CORM-401 was needed to significantly slow growth, we also tested this concentration and assayed cell pellets after 80 min of growth; in cells grown on glucose or succinate, the values found in cell pellets were 16.5 -0.69 mM and 10.9 -0.55 mM, respectively. The data sets are statistically different ( p < 0.05). Thus, irrespective of the CORM concentration in media, bacteria accumulate more CORM-401 in glucose media and suffer reduced viability (Fig. 2C) . Note, however, most of the accumulated manganese will be bound and buffered such that the exchangeable concentration within living cells will be much lower than the maximum of 3.5 mM that we recorded.

Energy metabolism genes were transiently affected by the addition of CORM-401 under aerobic conditions; genes were downregulated progressively over time and reached a minimum at 20 min where 24% of energy metabolism-related genes were downregulated ( Fig. 4A) . Anaerobically, the gene categories most affected were those involved in energy metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, phosphotransferase system genes, and motility ( Fig. 4B ). Genes involved in energy metabolism were more highly downregulated anaerobically than aerobically ( Fig. 4B and Fig. 6 ). Signal transduction genes and genetic information processing genes were highly upregulated: 17% of signal transduction genes were upregulated after 20 min.",

However, the response regulator Fis, which is involved in maintenance of nucleoid structure and other functions, including biofilm formation, motility, and chemotaxis, is in both quadrants ''c'' of Figure 5 , indicating that its response is similar in magnitude and kinetics when cells are exposed to CO gas or CORM-401 in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. As a further example of the correlation analysis, the coherence plot also reveals that FhlA (the transcriptional activator of the formate hydrogenlyase system, quadrant ''d'' of Fig. 5 , top, aerobic) responds similarly in terms of the activity profile when cells are exposed to CORM-401 or CO gas, but the magnitudes of the responses are dissimilar and FhlA does not appear in the anaerobic analysis.

The TFInfer coherence plot reveals two TFs that regulate genes in central respiratory metabolism: Fnr (fumarate nitrate reduction regulator) and ArcA. While Fnr was less perturbed (being in quadrant ''c'' of Fig. 5A, B) , ArcA responded differently under each condition (lying in quadrant ''d'' of Fig. 5A , but in quadrant ''c'' of Fig. 5B ). ArcAB, a twocomponent system, indirectly senses oxygen, in part, via the redox state of the quinone pool (1) . Under anoxic or microaerobic conditions, ArcB autophosphorylates, then transphosphorylates ArcA through a phosphorelay, increasing the affinity of ArcA for its DNA targets (26) . Phosphorylated active ArcA (ArcA-P) then represses expression of genes involved in aerobic respiration (e.g., electron transport enzymes, cytochrome bo', and the Krebs cycle enzymes) and activates genes involved in fermentative metabolism and cytochrome bd. Thus, in a mutant lacking oxidase function, as in the absence of oxygen as electron acceptor, the aerobic expression of ArcA-P-activated genes such as cydAB is elevated, but that of ArcA-P-repressible genes such as cy-oABCDE (encoding the heme-copper oxidase) is lowered (25) because the quinone pool is trapped in a reduced form and unable to inhibit the autokinase activity of ArcB.",

Davidge et al. also reported an increase in cydAB transcripts in response to CORM-3 (9). However, anaerobically, the cydAB genes were downregulated after 5 min. In contrast, genes encoding the cytochrome bo'-type oxidase (cyoABCDE) were, under aerobic conditions, transiently FIG. 6. Differential expression of genes involved in the respiratory chains both aerobically and anaerobically in response to 67 lM CORM-401. The heat map quantifies the changes elicited in selected genes; the heat scale at the right is expressed as the natural logarithm of the fold change. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web version of this article at www.liebertpub.com/ars downregulated by approximately fivefold after 5 min. This is consistent with repression of cyo expression by phosphorylated (active) ArcA. Anaerobically, the cyo operon was consistently downregulated by CORM-401; cyoA was 10fold downregulated after 10 min. Fold changes relating to respiratory changes are given in Supplementary Figure S3A . Figure 6 also shows other respiratory genes. The nuo genes encode a multisubunit, proton-translocating NADH dehydrogenase; all were upregulated by CORM-401 under aerobic conditions together with the oxidase genes. The initial CORM-401-induced increases in cyo expression (0-5 min) and the sustained increase in nuo expression (0-80 min) under aerobic conditions are not consistent with the anticipated repression of these systems by Arc alone; indeed, nuo expression is regulated in a complex manner not only by ArcA but also by NarL, Fnr, IHF, and other factors, including C 4 dicarboxylates (5) . In contrast to the effects of CO gas (69), expression of ndh, encoding NADH dehydrogenase II, was upregulated both aerobically and anaerobically for the first 5-10 min after CORM-401 exposure (Fig. 6 ).",

In the first scan, the 645 nm signal corresponds to the absorbance maximum of CO-ligated cytochrome d, and the 620 nm trough indicates removal of ferrous cytochrome d from the difference spectrum (9, 27) . Subsequently, a peak at 412 nm appeared, suggesting slower binding of CO to cytochrome o.

Respiration was followed at a constant stirring speed (and thus oxygen transfer rate) adjusted to give a near-steady state around 50% air saturation.

We measured a K L a (11) of 0.23 min -1 (SD 0.06, 10 measurements) and a glucose-stimulated respiration rate of nmol O .min -1 .mg -1 (SD 78, 13 measurements).

As a control, 1 mM KCN (a potent respiratory inhibitor) was added to the chamber (Fig. 7C ) when steady state had been reached after adding CORM; dissolved oxygen then increased abruptly to prerespiration levels, indicating respiratory inhibition as expected. This pattern resembles decreases in the respiration rate induced by substrate exhaustion in Klebsiella (10). The CORM 401stimulated oxygen consumption can be assigned to cellular respiration since it is cyanide sensitive. The stimulation by CORM-401 was further investigated by using the same cell suspension (as Fig. 7C ), but 10 lM carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a classical uncoupler of respiration, was added to the chamber (Fig. 7C, inset) . CCCP mimicked the effects of CORM-401; thus, both compounds stimulate oxygen consumption rates of E. coli cells.",

However, maximal inhibition of respiration typically occurs at high CO:O 2 ratios since CO is a competitive inhibitor of terminal oxidases with oxygen; CO:O 2 ratios of 4:1 to 20:1 are used in photochemical action spectra (6) . Thus, to maximize the potential inhibition of respiration by CORM-401, the stirring rotor speed was decreased to achieve a lower (but not zero) oxygen concentration in the chamber after stimulating res-piration with glucose (Fig. 7D) . On adding CORM-401, a very small transient inhibition was seen. A second addition of lM CORM-401 (arrow 2) produced mild, but prolonged, inhibition. To confirm these findings, 1 mM KCN was again added to the chamber and substantial inhibition followed. In the experiments of (28), 300 lM CORM-401 was required to inhibit respiration by endothelial cells. In summary, CORM-401 is not an effective inhibitor of respiration, even at low oxygen tensions, but stimulates respiration; such stimulation was described as uncoupling in endothelial cells (28) . CORM-401, like CCCP, polarizes the membrane in whole cells. CCCP and other protonophores (uncouplers) have dissociable protons and permeate membranes either as protonated acids or conjugated bases; they therefore facilitate proton exchange across energy-transducing membranes (43) .",

                "text": "To extend the understanding of energetic implications of CORM-401 administration, we measured membrane potential in whole cells using DiSC3 (5, 61) . DiSC3(5) is a cationic cyanine dye that responds fluorometrically to changes in membrane potential by potential-dependent partition between the cells and the extracellular medium. When a cell or membrane interior becomes negatively charged (polarized), the dye is taken up with consequent fluorescence quenching (61) . Depolarization, on the other hand, results in release of the dye and increase in fluorescence. The negatively charged interior of respiring E. coli cells led to uptake of the dye and slow fluorescence quenching; to collapse the membrane potential (Dw) and depolarize the membrane, K + and the K + -specific ionophore valinomycin were added (Fig. 8A) , whereupon net movement of the dye out of the cells resulted in increased fluorescence. However, a solution of CO (50 lM final concentration) did not significantly alter DiSC3 (5) fluorescence (Fig. 8B) . In marked contrast, addition of 50 lM CORM-401 ( Fig. 8C ) or only 1 lM CCCP (Fig. 8D ) led to sustained decreases in fluorescence over 15 min, demonstrating polarization of the membrane. Thus, both CORM-401 and CCCP stimulate respiration ( Fig. 7) and increase polarization of the membrane (Fig. 8 ) (see the Discussion section). To determine whether membrane polarization was mediated by potassium flux across the membrane, the potassium gradient was first collapsed by valinomycin ( Fig. 8E) , followed by additions of CORM-401 ( Fig. 8E ), or valinomycin followed by CCCP (Fig. 8F ). Addition of valinomycin caused a net movement of DiSC3 (5) out of the cell, as in Figure 8A , but when CORM-or CCCP was then added, polarization of the membrane was evident from the drop in fluorescence. In the case of CCCP, dramatic polarization was observed (an initial fluorescence decrease) as the collapse of the potassium charge gradient no longer impedes proton movement. The slower subsequent rise in fluorescence is attributed to a slow H + leak after initial hyperpolarization by CCCP. Therefore, polarization caused by CORM-401 and CCCP is potassium independent, suggesting involvement of H + or another cation.",

In accord with the observed respiratory stimulation and membrane polarization elicited by CORM-401 (above), transcriptomic studies highlighted numerous genes involved in the transport of potassium and zinc and genes involved in osmoregulation and ion homeostasis (Fig. 9) . The KdpFABC complex is a multisubunit ATP-driven potassium pump (24) . All four genes encoding the membrane transporter were upregulated within 5-10 min after CORM-401 treatment under aerobic conditions (Fig. 9) . The kdp genes are expressed when K + levels in the cell become limited (33) ; this expression is regulated by KdpD (sensor kinase) and KdpE (response regulator) comprising a two-component regulatory system. However, measurements of membrane polarization in the presence of valinomycin (Fig. 8) show that CORM-401-elicited polarization is independent of potassium gradients, and so it is likely that the changes in kdp gene expression reflect global osmotic changes (30, 34) and/or the physicochemical state of the membrane, as induced by ethanol, procaine, and others (66) . In addition to this high-affinity potassium transport system, chaA, encoding a K + /Na + :H + antiporter, was also transiently upregulated both aerobically and anaerobically (Fig. 9 ).

The expression of this porin and of the other major porin OmpC is exquisitely regulated (45) . Because noxious agents such as antibiotics diffuse more readily through the larger OmpF channel, its increased production also facilitates entry of nutrients. Environmental osmotic status is sensed by the EnvZ component of the EnvZ-OmpR two-component system. High osmolarity activates OmpR, and ompC expression is increased and ompF expression decreases. The present data thus point to bacterial sensing of increased osmotic pressure. The OmpC and OmpF channels appear differentially regulated to tackle changes in osmotic pressure; OmpF may be downregulated to avoid mass movement of unwanted solutes into the cell, including the CORM-401 compound itself, while expression of the smaller channel, OmpC, allows finer control of solute movement. Other systems that control turgor pressure include the aquaporin aqpZ, a water channel that allows the bidirectional movement of water in response to osmotic stress (62) . This channel was slightly downregulated in aerobic conditions in response to CORM-401 ( Fig. 9) .",

Although passive potassium movements appear not to be invoked by CORM-401, other data (above; upregulation of kdp and downregulation of potassium efflux machinery) suggested that bacteria experienced potassium limitation. We therefore assessed the levels of total intracellular potassium and trace metals in the presence of CORM-401 using ICP-MS. Figure 10 shows that 67 lM CORM-401 decreased the intracellular concentration of potassium and zinc by about threefold over 40 min. There were no measurable changes of copper or iron levels in response to CORM-401 addition, nor were genes implicated in the metabolism of these altered ions.",

Exposure of cells to CORM-401 upregulated numerous genes under the transcriptional control of Bae/Cpx (Fig. 11) . Genes encoding the multidrug efflux system (mdtA-D) were more than 60-fold upregulated under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions ( Supplementary Fig. S3C ). Upregulation of the Cpx response by CORM-2 (46) and involvement of the Cpx and Bae systems in response to CORM-3 have been noted previously (9, 38) . The most dramatic perturbation was that of the periplasmic chaperone Spy, which was upregulated by >400-fold aerobically and >600-fold anaerobically ( Supplementary Fig. S3C ); CORM-3 elicits similar changes (9, 38) .",

Levels of the periplasmic chaperone CpxP were clearly detected in the absence of CORM (Fig. 12B, lane 1) and also on incubation with control compounds (Fig. 12B, lane 2) , but a significant decrease in CpxP abundance was seen after 2 h of CORMtreatment (lane 3). The CORM-induced decrease in CpxP is consistent with literature on the Cpx response (55) ; since CpxP is a negative regulator, its levels are lowered to achieve the Cpx response evident in Figure 11 .",

The effects of CORM-401 on bacterial outer membranes (OMs) were therefore assayed using N-phenyl-1-napthylamine (NPN), a membraneimpermeable fluorophore that increases fluorescence in a hydrophobic environment (61) . Thus, when the bacterial membrane becomes perturbed (e.g., by an antibiotic or CORM-401), the dye partitions into the outer membrane, leading to an increase in fluorescence. Interestingly, the addition of CORM-401 to cells in the presence of NPN showed no increase in membrane damage, even after several hours (Fig. 12C) . The detergent Triton X-100 was used as a positive control (Fig. 12C) . Thus, the action of CORM-401 is distinct from CORM-3: the upregulation of Spy protein and transcript levels by CORM-401 appears indirect and due to perturbation of cellular osmotic balance and metal ion homeostasis.",

The present compound, CORM-401, is also a manganese complex, on which few studies are published. In previous work, it released 2.1-3 mol CO in the myoglobin assay (16) , in line with our determination of 2.4-2.5 mol in minimal growth medium or phosphate buffer and with myoglobin at a fourfold excess over CORM-401. In mammalian studies, the higher CO yield elicited more effective aortic relaxation and vasodilation than did CORM-A1, which has a similar halftime of CO release, but a lower molar CO yield. CORM-401 reduces inflammation and damage in pig kidneys in a preclinical model of organ donation (3) and reverses the metabolic changes that occur during lipopolysaccharide-induced microglia inflammation (72) . In endothelial cells, there is evidence that the CO released from CORM-401 uncouples mitochondrial respiration and inhibits glycolysis (28) since inactive CORM-401 (iCORM) (actually a mix of MnSO 4 and the CORM-401 ligand DTC) did not induce these effects. However, even 300 lM CORM-401 elicited only twofold elevation in the oxygen consumption rate, whereas only 1 lM CCCP gave greater stimulation (28) . CORM-401 therefore exerts relatively weak, but clear uncoupler-like, activity in mammalian cells, a result confirmed here in bacteria (Fig. 7C) . In endothelial cells, CORM-401 also reactivated mitoBK Ca channels after blockage with paxilline (28) . The mechanistic basis of most of these effects on mitochondria is unclear, but it is assumed that at the highest CORM concentrations, the decrease in respiration rate is due to inhibition of cytochrome oxidase activity (28) . Activation of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins has been proposed to explain CORM-3-uncoupled metabolism in cardiomyocytes (36) .",

First, the released CO does target terminal oxidases (Fig. 7A ) leading to slight reductions in oxygen consumption rates (Fig. 7B, D) , but the stimulatory effects on respiration are much more significant (Fig. 7C) . In-depth transcriptomic and modeling studies (Figs. 4-6 ) confirm effects on respiratory gene regulation. More striking are the elevations in intracellular Mn concentrations (and thus the CORM, Fig. 3 ). We suggest that buildup of the metal co-ligand fragment in the cytoplasm to millimolar concentrations leads to disruption of charge ( Fig. 8 ) and ion balance ( Fig. 10 ) and the perception by the cell that it is undergoing osmotic stress (Figs. 9, 11, 12 ). These ideas are summarized in Figure 14 . The mechanism of polarization caused by CORM-401 is unclear, but is independent of potassium gradients (Fig. 8 ) and presumably caused by perturbation of other ionic balances across the membrane. In mammalian systems also, the CORM-401-enhanced resistance of cardiomyocytes to oxidative stress may be, at least in part, due to the manganese center (31) . However, in contrast to (28), we cannot attribute the effects on membrane polarization to the released CO since a CO gas solution is without effect on membrane potential (Fig. 8B ). Our proposals that CORM-401 toxicity is not dependent on respiratory inhibition are in accord with other studies, notably the finding that CORM-3 is toxic to bacteria even in the absence of a heme target (74) .",

However, the fact that CORM-401, like CCCP, caused polarization of the membrane ( Fig. 8 ) suggests that this is compensated by enhanced respiration. That bacteria remain viable after CCCP treatment and can mount such a respiratory response is evidenced by the fact that neither 100 lM CORM-401 (this work, Fig. 2 ) nor 1 lM CCCP significantly inhibits growth and respiration remains responsive to imposed membrane conditions.

The charged metal species produced when the compound releases CO might also affect charge separation across the membrane. It is expected that when CO groups are released from CORM-401, the metal in the residual co-ligand fragment will become oxidized giving an Mn(II) species. It is therefore interesting that upon CORM-401 addition, cells become polarized; this may be due to perturbation of charge separation across the membrane or by accumulation of compatible solutes, with little or no negative charge, to balance the influx of positive charge (75) . In addition to polarization, loss of K + and Zn(II) from the cell (Fig. 10 ) may result from accumulation of charge. The mechanosensitive channel, MscS, which is upregulated in response to osmotic pressure, was also upregulated (Fig. 9) . We suggest that a contributing factor to the action of CORM-401 is generation of high osmotic pressure upon extreme accumulation of the compound (Fig. 3) . Although cellular envelope stress responses are upregulated at the transcriptomic and protein levels, and transport systems for metal ions and water are differentially expressed in response to CORM-401 ( Fig. 8) , CORM-401, unlike CORM-3, has little effect on the cell membrane as assessed by NPN fluorescence.",

The resistance of P. aeruginosa to CORM-401 appears contrary to the results of previous research using CORM-2 (40). However, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii express multiple efflux pumps, making them resistant to numerous antibiotics (19, 64) . The hypothesis that these strains fail to accumulate CORM-401 intracellularly might be tested by analyses of manganese contents and comparison of sensitive and resistant strains. Resistance to CORM-401 may also reflect the ability of resistant bacteria to produce and excrete mucoid substances forming a peripheral capsule around the pathogens, hindering access of the metal carbonyl compound. Capsule production decreases sensitivity to antibiotics and renders pathogens resistant to phagocytosis by macrophages and to the toxic effects of free radical species (21, 22) . The potential for CORMs to act as novel antimicrobials against other clinical isolates is indicated by the sensitivity of numerous bacterial species, including several members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. For example, the sensitivity of the urinary tract and bloodstream pathogen E. coli EC958 to CORM-401 suggests that exploration of these CO releasers as potential anti-UTI drugs either alone or with current antibiotics is a realistic possibility.",

Once the Mn in CORM-401 loses CO, Mn(I) will probably be oxidized to Mn(II). Mn(II) is kinetically labile and it is probable that the [O 2 CCH 2 NMeCS 2 ] 2ligand dissociates.

Briefly, bacteria were diluted in Evans medium to reach an OD of around 0.3 (*5 \u2022 10 5 cfu/mL) and 200 lL of the suspension pipetted into each well of a 96-well plate. The concentrations used for wild-type MG1655 were CORM-401 (100-600 lM), trimethoprim (1-16 lg/mL), and cefotaxime (1.0-32 lg/mL). For strain EC958, concentrations were CORM-401 (37.5-600 lM), colistin (0.25-8 lg/mL), doxycycline (6-96 lg/mL), and gentamicin (0.125-4 lg/mL) added alone or in combination with CORM-401. Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking for 24 h using a Tecan Sunrise plate reader. The concentrations tested were up to four 2-fold dilutions lower than the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and, where possible, two 2-fold dilutions higher than the MIC. The MIC was considered as the lowest concentration of the agent alone or combined with CORM-401 that inhibited growth. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) (44) was calculated to determine drug interaction and interpreted as follows:",

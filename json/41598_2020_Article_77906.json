    "abstract": "Fish reproductive success is linked to the ability of couples to mate and produce clutches that successfully hatch. Environmental stressors like high temperature and low pH can jeopardize this energetically costly process. In this study, exposure to high temperature and low pH was tested on a marine temperate species, Gobiusculus flavescens, to evaluate effects on reproductive performance. Breeding pairs were assigned to different temperatures (+ \u00b0C, + 3 \u00b0C relative to in situ temperature) and pH levels (8.0, 7.6), in a cross-factorial design for a 3-month period. Reproduction activity, success, and paternal investment were measured throughout the exposure period. Results show reproduction is impaired by elevated temperature, while low pH had little impact. Breeding pairs under high temperature had 3% to 10% hatching success, up to 30% less eggs and eggs up to 20% smaller. Although paternal investment was not affected by tested parameters, males of breeding pairs exposed to elevated temperature had smaller gonadosomatic indexes, which might indicate a lack of investment in the reproductive process. Overall, results show that elevated temperature, expected more frequently in the near future, as a consequence of global warming, may impair key processes like reproduction in temperate fish, with potential consequences for fitness and population replenishment. Reproduction is an energetically expensive process. Successful reproduction requires investment of time and energy sometimes in detriment of other essential functions that maintain organisms' fitness. For organisms with multiple reproduction events, sacrificing reproduction over other processes, through prioritization of energy toward vital processes and functions, can increase their chances of survival in a stressing environment. However, disregarding reproduction can put at risk the long-term survival of the species 2. In the two-spotted goby, Gobiusculus flavescens, used in this study, reproduction success includes physiological 3 and behavioural 4 processes. Females can allocate energy for partner selection, courtship, egg production, and offspring development 5 , while males energy can be allocated for partner selection, courtship, nest construction and defence 6,7. The ability of a couple to successfully mate and produce clutches, as well as their potential investment in taking care of the clutches (parental care), is determinant aspects for their offspring's fitness. Environmental factors can constraint reproduction of marine organisms 8,9. Projections for the end of the century suggest an average increase in temperature and pCO 2 in surface ocean up to + 2.5 \u00b0C and + 500\u00b5atm, respectively. The increase of pCO 2 in the water leads to a process known as ocean acidification, a perturbation of the carbonate chemistry including a decrease in pH. However, the situation is more complex in the coastal zone where natural and anthropogenic events, such as upwelling 11 and eutrophication 12 , lead to high variability in temperature and pCO 2 13. Changes in temperature, one of the most important cues for the onset of the reproductive season, can be responsible for delaying or even interrupting reproductive processes. Fluctuations in the reproductive timings, can in turn, cause a mismatch effect between offspring, food availability and predators 15. For example, elevated temperatures can disrupt the metabolic activity and foraging behaviours of predators 16,17 and preys 18. pH has also been shown to impact reproduction in fish. Some studies showed that reproductive outputs can be up to 50% higher at lower pH, deviating from present environmental pH variability 3,19,20. Other studies show reduced reproductive output in fish exposed to lower pH, as well as eggs' abnormalities 20,21. Impairing reproduction can have severe effects on the offspring quality, however, increasing the investment in reproduction might require using energy that otherwise would be allocated to maintain the homeostasis of the adult organisms 22,23 , and therefore make them more vulnerable to these stressors.",

Clutches produced under higher temperature had fewer and smaller eggs, and these couples had overall a smaller reproductive output. On the contrary low pH and the interaction of high temperature low pH did not have any effect on the number and size of the eggs. This is consistent with the study on Amphiprion melanopus, that found temperature had a greater impact on reproductive performance than CO 2 30 . Another study on two-spotted gobies, sampled at the same field site, did not find any significant effect of acute exposure to decreased pH (pH 7.6) on spawning or the clutch size 21 . For this population, acclimation times, acute (few days in Forsgren et al. 21 ) or chronic (1 month, this study) did not modulate the response to decreased pH. Different results were found for the same species by Faria et al. . Reproduction was stimulated under low pH with an increase in number of clutches and number of eggs. However, this came at a cost, with smaller eggs and larvae at hatch 3 . This is likely a consequence of different experimental conditions, as Faria et al. 3 exposed fish to more extreme pCO 2 levels than the levels in the current study (~ 2300 vs. ~ 1300 \u00b5atm, respectively). However, it could also be attributed to a population effect, as Faria et al. 3 tested fish from the Portuguese coast (the southern limit www.nature.com/scientificreports/ distribution of two-spotted goby), while in the current study fish were sampled from a population that inhabits the Gullmarn fjord, in the Northern Sea. Different populations of a given species can present different sensitivities to pH through local adaptation; populations inhabiting more variable environments being able to tolerate lower pH 33 . The Gullmarn fjord has variable pH with variations up to 0.9 pH units within a single month and pH as low as 7.6 being documented 34 . Our tested scenario (pH 7.6) being within the natural range of variability, it is then not surprising that only mild effects were observed. We observed a shorter embryonic duration (5-6 days, under all treatments) as compared to the average 10 days of embryonic development reported in other studies 3, 21 . This may be a consequence of a particularly warm temperature in Sweden in 2018. The two-spotted goby experiences an average temperature of 16 \u00b0C during their reproductive season 21, 35 , and in 2018 the maximum recorded temperature during the breeding period reached, 20 \u00b0C (Kristineberg Weather Station-https ://www.weath er.loven .gu.se/krist inebe rg/en/data.shtml ). These record temperatures might have contributed to the observed lower reproductive success under the high temperature treatments.",

Larger livers are likely related to higher needs for energy storage under metabolic stress at higher temperature 41 . However, in the two-spotted goby, neither high temperature nor the interaction of high temperature and low pH had an effect on the HSI. Low pH had a significant effect, that might be related to the stress caused by pH. There is no evidence suggesting that liver size directly compromises reproduction, nonetheless indirectly it might influence the size of the gonads (due to space limitation in the abdominal cavity) and overall the reproductive and metabolic processes.",

This is consistent with previous studies showing that temperature influences reproduction in fish 14, 42 . Exposure to high temperature within the thermal range fishes are used to endure will make them spend more energy to maintain cellular functions and impair other behaviours not directly essential for their survival 30 . The effect of temperature changes on reproduction is well documented in fish from warmer regions 43 . Studies on species exposed to wider thermal ranges are more scarce. Reproduction performance is an important part of fish development and it is then crucial to understand the impacts of multiple stressors such as pH and temperature in cross-factorial studies 28, 44 . Out study shows that exposure to extreme present conditions of temperature and pH already have negative effects on multiple aspects of reproduction. Projections show that such conditions will be more frequent and be more extreme in the near-future. For example, temperature up to 21 \u00b0C have been documented in June 2020 in the Gullmarn fjord (Kristineberg Weather Station-https ://www.weath er.loven .gu.se/krist inebe rg/en/data.shtml ).

Additionally, transgenerational experiments, where more than one generation is bread in the lab under different environmental conditions, would be important to evaluate adaptation and acclimatization potential to future conditions.

After laboratory acclimation, fish were exposed to a total of four treatments: 1) Environment (EVM)-+ 0.0 \u00b0C \u00d7 pH T 8.0; 2) pH-+ 0.0 \u00b0C \u00d7 pH T 7.6; 3) Temperature (T\u00b0)-+ 3.0 \u00b0C \u00d7 pH T 8.0; 4) Temperature \u00d7 pH (T\u00b0xpH)-+ 3.0 \u00b0C \u00d7 pH T 7.6. pH 7.6 was selected as the average pH in the fjord by 2100 and the extreme of the present natural variability . Eight replicates per treatment were used. Temperature and pH were slowly changed in elevated temperature and low pH aquaria (+ 1 \u00b0C/per week; \u2212 0.1 pH/per week), until temperature was + 3 \u00b0C as compared to ambient conditions and pH was 7.6. pH was maintained through bubbling of pure CO 2 and using pH-computers (Aqua Medic, Bissendorf Germany) in each aquarium. In the other aquaria, temperature and pH were maintained at the natural variability of the fjord, throughout the duration of the experiment. High temperature treatments were adjusted throughout the experiment to always maintain a + 3 \u00b0C difference from the in situ temperature. Fish were kept under a light cycle of 16/8, and were fed Artemia twice a day, ad libitum. After 1 month of acclimation to the new conditions, all 64 fish were measured and weighed. A male and female were chosen at random from the same treatment, placed in one 30L aquaria, with temperature and pH conditions matching the ones from the acclimation aquaria, and allowed to breed.",

Each pipe was line with a removable acetate sheet, where the spawning females could attach their eggs. Presence of an egg clutch was checked daily. In the presence of eggs, the acetate sheet was carefully removed, placed in a Petri dish filled with seawater from the same aquarium and then photographed for later counting. Approximately 10 eggs were gently removed from the clutch, placed in a smaller Petri dish and photographed under a stereomicroscope for measurement of their surface area. Couples were not affected by the brief removal of the acetate sheet, as the fish resumed normal activity after the acetate sheet was put back in the nest. Males with clutches were recorded with a Panasonic HDC-SD90 camera, for 10 min in the morning 1 h after being fed, as it has been shown that food availability has no effect on parental care for the two spotted goby 6 . Studies showed records of parental care averaging 8 to 20 min are enough to observe fish parental care 36, 47 , which corroborates our personal observations. All recordings were done from day 2 to 4 after spawning. Videos were subsequently analysed using the Observer XT software (Noldus technology version 5, Netherlands) to quantify the time spent: (1) fanning, (2) cleaning, (3) defending, and (4) chasing the female, as well as (5) total time spent outside and inside the nest. Fanning behaviour consisted of swimming movements with the caudal, dorsal and pelvic fins, to aerate the eggs (adapted from Baklow 48 ). Cleaning behaviours included the removal of dead, unfertilized or infected eggs, and debris adapted from Blumer ). Defending was defined as the guarding position the male assumed on the nest entry, to avoid intruders. Chasing the female behaviours consisted in charge and chasing the female, outside the nest, to prevent her entrance in the nest.",

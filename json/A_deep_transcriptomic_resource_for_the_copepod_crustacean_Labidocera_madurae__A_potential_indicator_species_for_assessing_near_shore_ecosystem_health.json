    "abstract": "Coral reef ecosystems of many subtropical and tropical marine coastal environments have suffered significant degradation from anthropogenic sources. Research to inform management strategies that mitigate stressors and promote a healthy ecosystem has focused on the ecology and physiology of coral reefs and associated organisms. Few studies focus on the surrounding pelagic communities, which are equally important to ecosystem function. Zooplankton, often dominated by small crustaceans such as copepods, is an important food source for invertebrates and fishes, especially larval fishes. The reef-associated zooplankton includes a sub-neustonic copepod family that could serve as an indicator species for the community. Here, we describe the generation of a de novo transcriptome for one such copepod, Labidocera madurae, a pontellid from an intensively-studied coral reef ecosystem, K\u0101ne'ohe Bay, Oahu, Hawai'i. The transcriptome was assembled using high-throughput sequence data obtained from whole organisms. It comprised 211,002 unique transcripts, including 72,391 with coding regions. It was assessed for quality and completeness using multiple workflows. Bench-marking-universal-single-copy-orthologs (BUSCO) analysis identified transcripts for 88% of expected eukaryotic core proteins. Targeted gene-discovery analyses included searches for transcripts coding full-length \"giant\" proteins (>4,000 amino acids), proteins and splice variants of voltage-gated sodium channels, and proteins involved in the circadian signaling pathway. Four different reference transcriptomes were generated and compared for the detection of differential gene expression between copepodites and adult females; 6,229 genes were consistently identified as differentially expressed between the two regardless of reference. Automated bioinformatics analyses and targeted manual gene curation suggest that the de novo assembled L. madurae transcriptome is of high quality and completeness. This transcriptome provides a new resource for assessing the global physiological status of a planktonic species inhabiting a coral reef ecosystem that is subjected to multiple anthropogenic stressors. The workflows provide a template for generating and assessing transcriptomes in other non-model species.",

                "text": "Copepods are ubiquitous in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, living in marine, estuarine, freshwater and interstitial environments from the deepest ocean trenches to the top of mountain peaks [1] . Labidocera madurae is in the family Pontellidae, which are free-living surface dwelling planktonic copepods that are particularly abundant in coastal marine environments [2] . The genus Labidocera is a key member of oligotrophic waters surrounding coral reefs in the Pacific and Indian Oceans including K\u0101ne'ohe Bay, Oahu, Hawai'i [3, 4] . K\u0101ne'ohe Bay has a thriving coral reef community, which has shown significant resilience and the ability to recover from major environmental perturbations, including pollution, eutrophication, high temperatures, and low salinities [5] [6] [7] . It is also one of the best-studied coral reef ecosystems, and serves as a natural laboratory for experimental research on coral reef habitats [8] [9] . Equally important are the pelagic regions that surround coral reefs, which serve both as a source of food and habitat for reef dwellers. Fishes, corals and other invertebrates have bi-phasic lifestyles: their larvae spend days to months in the plankton before settling nearshore, often within 100 m of their parents [10] . Furthermore, planktivorous reef-dwelling fishes and invertebrates depend on the abundant supply of zooplankton brought to them by currents [11] [12] . Thus, the coral reef ecosystem includes both coral reef areas and the surrounding open water.",

Genetic barcoding indicates that while the L. madurae present in K\u0101ne'ohe Bay is genetically unique, it is clearly a member of the L. madurae species complex [3, 4] . Because L madurae occurs throughout K\u0101ne'ohe Bay and its surrounding inshore waters, and it is moderately abundant year-round, it has the potential to be an indicator species for the pelagic regions of this estuarine system [13, 14] . As one of the larger copepod species in K\u0101ne'ohe Bay (Fig 1) , its physiology and behavior has been investigated [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, L. madurae has been inaccessible to the genetic and genomic research tools that, applied to model organisms, have yielded so much insight into basic biology. As a group, copepods and other crustaceans are under-represented in the number of sequenced genomes and genomic resources. Thus, much of the basic understanding of the taxon potentially available from such resources is lacking. While there are several crustacean genome projects in progress (e.g., the water flea Daphnia magna, the copepods Tigriopus californicus, Tigriopus kingsejongensis, Eurytemora affinis and the amphipod Hyalella azteca), the genome of Daphnia pulex stands out as the only crustacean genome thus far completed, curated, fully annotated, and accessible through a searchable web portal (wFlea-Base; http://wfleabase.org/) [20] .",

However, the quality of de novo assemblies is variable [21, 22] , and poor quality limits their usefulness in physiological and cellular studies that use gene expression profiles. Thus, the goal of this study was to generate a deep and high-quality de novo transcriptome for L. madurae. Furthermore, multiple workflows were used to provide complementary indicators for assessing its quality and depth. RNA was obtained from multiple developmental stages to increase the representation of transcripts, since a significant percentage of genes are silent in any particular stage [23] . Bioinformatics tools described in the Methods section were used to assemble and provide an initial evaluation of quality based on assembly, mapping and annotation statistics. This analysis was followed by targeted searches for transcripts encoding proteins of interest: green fluorescent proteins (GFP ; Fig 1) , the voltage-gated sodium channel (Na V ), and the proteins involved in circadian signalling. All of the proteins are highly conserved across eukaryotes and possess stereotypical structural domains that were used to vet the completeness of the identified sequences. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186794.g001",

The field collection did not require any permits or approval and was performed by PHL and DKH using a personal watercraft. Zooplankton collections were immediately diluted into a bucket containing 5-10 L of seawater and returned to the laboratory. Adult female and copepodite L. madurae were sorted from samples under the microscope, rinsed in filtered seawater, transferred onto a sieve to remove excess seawater and either preserved in RNAlater (Ambion) (adult females) or prepared for immediate RNA extraction (copepodites). The copepodites were inspected for stage distribution prior to total RNA extraction.

This led to the removal of an average of 11% of reads, leaving from 79 to 85 million reads per sample for the de novo assembly. The resulting reads from the six libraries were combined and assembled using Trinity (v. 2.0.6) [24] on the National Center for Genome Analysis Support's (NCGAS; Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA) Mason Linux cluster.

Then, all predicted transcripts with coding region were automatically annotated using a local BLAST webserver on a Beowulf cluster running the NCBI BLAST algorithm [26] . The BLASTx algorithm was used to search against the SwissProt protein database [27] (downloaded on 18 th September, 2015 from NCBI) employing a maximum E-value for annotation of 10 \u22123 . As a third step, the resulting BLAST annotations were mapped against the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database using UniProt [28] . The transcripts with GO terms were classified under three categories: biological process, molecular function and cellular component, which are hierarchically organized into levels. Lastly, \"Bench-marking universal single-copy orthologs\" (BUSCO) software (v1.22) was used to identify core genes: a set of singlecopy genes highly conserved among eukaryotes and thus expected to be present in a complete assembly [29] . BUSCO analysis was performed using the Arthropoda dataset consisting of 2,675 single-copy orthologs.",

BLAST searches for transcripts encoding putative circadian signaling system proteins including those for core clock, clock-associated, clock input pathway and clock output pathway proteins [33] [34] [35] . The circadian proteins were identified as \"full-length\" if they exhibit a functional signal sequence (including a \"start\" methionine) and were flanked on their C-terminus end by a stop codon, while \"partial\" proteins either lacked a start methionine (referred to as C-terminal partial proteins), or a stop codon (referred to as N-terminal partial proteins), or both of these features (referred to as internal fragment proteins).

For these two proteins, the extant D. plexippus protein dataset present in GenBank was used for the reciprocal BLAST. The arthropod protein most similar to each L. madurae sequence was subsequently determined by conducting a BLAST search of the non-redundant arthropod protein dataset (taxid:6656) curated at NCBI. Finally, protein structural motifs were analyzed for each of the L. madurae proteins using the online program Pfam (v 29.0) [32] .

Each dataset generated by the mapping program was then tested for statistical significance using the BioConductor package edgeR [42] . As implemented by edgeR, prior to statistical testing, RNA-Seq libraries were normalized using the TMM methods (trimmed means of M values), followed by the removal of transcripts with expression levels below 1 count per million (1 cpm). Transcripts with a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value <0.05 were considered differentially expressed (DEGs). Venny (v. 2.1) and BioVenn were used to generate Venn diagrams of the DEGs identified using kallisto and Bowtie [43, 44] . Differential expression of the target genes was analyzed and compared across transcriptomes.",

Illumina sequencing of six libraries yielded 528 million paired-end reads ranging in length from 50 to 151 base pairs (bp) and over 92% of these reads were of high quality (Phred score !30). These reads were de novo assembled using the Trinity software package (see Methods)( Table 1 ). The first step in quality assessment was to generate the battery of standard statistical measures characterizing the results. The assembly produced 211,002 transcripts with an average length of 872 bp, a maximum of 23,836 bp and an N50 value of 1,184 bp (Table 1) . It contained 153,604 \"Trinity predicted genes\" that is transcripts with unique \"TR# | c#_g#\" identifiers ( Table 1 ).

Within the \"biological process\" category, L. madurae transcripts covered broadly conserved eukaryotic processes with \"cellular process\", \"metabolic process\" and \"single-organism process\" representing more than 60% of the annotated transcripts (Fig 3) . Eighty percent of transcripts with GO terms were annotated within the KEGG database (Table 1) , indicating good coverage of transcripts encoding proteins/enzymes involved in lipid, amino acid and energy metabolism pathways (S1 Fig) . BUSCO analysis identified 76% (2,036) complete orthologs of 2,679 core eukaryotic genes in the CDS with <1% of these genes present in more than one copy (duplicated). An additional 11% of fragmented core genes were found among the CDS, with only 12% of core genes missing completely ( Table 1) . The assembly and annotation statistics of the L. madurae de novo transcriptome were compared with those of other non-model arthropods: three insect species and five other copepods (Table 2) [23, 47, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . The number of assembled transcripts is quite variable across de novo transcriptomes with the number in the L. madurae transcriptome (~200K) being among the highest (Tables 1 and 2 ). The number of transcripts with coding regions is higher in copepods, including L. madurae, than that reported for the insect, Lygus hesperus (Western tarnished plant bug) [49] . Interestingly, the L. madurae annotation rates (87% of transcripts with coding regions) were higher than those reported in the other copepods which can in part be attributed to limiting annotation to protein encoding transcripts ( Table 2 ). The number of predicted core proteins was similar across the transcriptomes with an approximate coverage of 80 to 90% based on the BUSCO analysis (Table 2) . Overall, the annotation statistics suggests that the L. madurae transcriptome is at least as good in quality and depth as the others with which it was compared.",

Unlike most copepods, the pontellid eye includes a clear lens, which requires structural proteins that are both stable and transparent. However not much is known about the structure of invertebrate lenses [58] . In vertebrates, the structural proteins of lenses include crystallins, which have been well characterized. A search of the L. madurae list of automated annotated transcripts identified 20 putative crystallins. Fifteen of these encode putative \u03b1-crystallins, with others encoding putative members of the \u03b2-crystallin (2), the \u03b3-crystallin (1) and \u03bb-crystallin (1) families (S2 Table) . The \u03b2-and \u03b3-crystallins, which form a partnership with \u03b1-crystallins, are the primary structural proteins of the vertebrate lens [59, 60] . Thus, one or more of these transcripts might be involved in lens formation in L. madurae. * BUSCO analysis was performed in 2017 using publicly accessible NCBI \"transcriptome shotgun assembly\". TSA data were first processed using transdecoder, followed by BUSCO (v.1.22) specifying the \"Arthropoda\" dataset, which included 2,675 core genes-analysis. TSA accession numbers: GAXK00000000 (C. finmarchicus), GCJT01000000 (P. nana), GCHA01000000 (T. japonicus), GDFW00000000 (T. kingsejongensis) ** # of transcripts given is the number of isotigs, N50 value is the isotig N50.L. madurae de novo assembly included a significant number of contigs (>100K), which lacked an open reading frame. Many of these non-coding sequences could belong to a class of transcripts called \"long (>200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs\" (lncRNAs). While these sequences are often omitted from de novo transcriptomes, they are unlikely to be \"assembly artifacts\".",

Thus, as a stringent test of transcriptome quality, we assessed the assembly of the L. madurae Na V s proteins (Labma Na V s), comparing it with that from our previously published well-vetted transcriptome for C. finmarchicus [23, 38, 62, 63] . We examined whether expectations were met in: 1) the number and completeness of predicted Na V genes, identified by their expected characteristics (match statistics, conserved motifs, length); 2) the occurrence and nature of predicted splice variants; 3) how well Na V s were grouped into the Trinity hierarchy; 4) the occurrence and nature of irregularities (incorrect or incomplete sequences).",

Site I is an N-terminal region of optional segments (putative exons; Fig 4) ; site II is an alternatively spliced segment nearer the C-terminal end. Both sites correspond to ones in Calfi Na V 1.1 ( Table 4 ). The two sites are separated by a minimum of residues in L. madurae, well over a cDNA-insert-length (200-300 bp mean value), so the associations implied by the contigs assembled that include those two regions are unreliable. This does not imply a poorer quality of assembly compared with other paired-end assemblies of cDNA inserts of the same length: it is intrinsic to the shotgun approach. This caveat applies to four of the seven contigs of Labma Na V 1.1 (Fig 4) , but as well to the long contigs (18 in all) of Calfi Na V 1.1 (see Fig 10 of Lenz et al [23] ). Despite this ambiguity, the Labma Na V 1.1 contigs gave solid evidence for the presence of four optional segments at Site I and one alternative segment at Site II, which is qualitatively similar to the pattern found in C. finmarchicus. No clear evidence for splice variants was found for Labma Na V 1.2 (i2 is an anomalous fragment, possibly artifactual), the same being the case for Calfi Na V 1.2. For Labma Na V 2, the two members of each pair of fragments (TR65477 and TR68660) differ in the presence of \"optional\" segments in each, a feature not found in Calfi Na V 2 (arrows in the Na V 2 diagram of Fig 4) . Thus, aside from this last case, the L. madurae transcriptome showed splicing features expected from the C. finmarchicus assembly. Most differences in the details (see below) are likely species differences. Hierarchical transcript grouping by Trinity, as outlined in Methods, enables classifying assembled sequences into likely gene families, genes and isoforms. It performed well on the Labma Na V 1 genes, separating them correctly into two genes nested within a single family. In contrast, transcripts for the same Calfi Na V 1 genes are more broadly assigned, spanning four \"Chrysalis components\" (comps = gene proxies; Table 4 ) [24] . Reassembly of the C. finmarchicus transcriptome using Trinity 2.0.6 only reduced this number from four to three and failed to include them in the same gene family. Thus the L. madurae transcriptome is of higher quality in this respect than that of C. finmarchicus. On the other hand, a single transcript coded for Calfi Na V 2, while Labma Na V 2 was present as two fragments assigned to different Trinity (2.0.6) predicted gene families (Table 4) . Still, these fragments had overlapping ends and could be amalgamated to form a full-length predicted protein with all of the expected properties. Thus the overall structure of the three Na V genes was successfully assembled in the L. madurae transcriptome with about the same quality as for that of the C. finmarchicus.",

This is likely in part a species difference. Anomalous sequences of various origins were also noted. These include a short contig (TR25803|c0_g1_i1) that may represent an additional Labma Na V 1 (Table 4 ) and a sequence with a frame-shift that is probably an error. In addition, several issues appear to have arisen from the ambiguity in assembling regions of variation bridged by segments with identical sequences that are longer than one cDNA-insert-length: 1) isoforms, especially within the Labma Na V 1.1 gene, code for partial rather than full-length proteins (Table 4) ; 2) Calfi Na V 1.1s have many more full-length contigs (18 vs 2) perhaps reflecting a greater leniency of Trinity 1.0 for matching variable regions; 3) genetic variability within the population may have increased the number of variable regions, possibly contributing to premature truncation of sequences.",

PDP1 was represented with four predicted genes, one with a splice variant, as shown in Fig 5. While parts of the molecule were very conserved, there were significant differences between the predicted proteins, which may reflect diversity in function. In the case of the CRY2 protein, 12 distinct transcripts were identified, and while they differed in length (Table 5) , the predicted proteins were all identical.

The large suite of proteins predicted from the Labidocera transcriptome (Table 5) , include, among others, the canonical core clock proteins CLK, CYC, PER and TIM, all showing significant homology to those of D. melanogaster (S4 Table) . They possess structural domains consistent with their fruit fly homologs, domains required for normal function (S1 Fig) . Moreover, putative L. madurae homologs of both CRY1 and CRY2 were identified (Table 5) , a finding that suggests that the Labidocera circadian system is organized more similarly to the \"ancestral-type\" clock proposed for lepidopteran/mosquito species than to that of D. melanogaster [66] . Specifically, CRY2, which is missing in Drosophila, but participates in the core clock itself, is likely to be a repressor of CLK-CYC-mediated transcription, while CRY1 functions as a photoreceptor, putatively providing photic input to the core clock. This result is consistent with the \"ancestral-type\" circadian systems described in other crustaceans that have been examined via genome/ transcriptome analyses [33] [34] [35] 69 ], suggesting that this type of clock organization is broadly conserved within members of this arthropod subphylum.",

The results suggest the presence of multiple genes from several protein families: DBT (three genes), PDP1 (four genes), PP1 (four genes), MTS (two genes), TWS (two genes) and SGG (two genes). No members of PDP1 had been identified previously from either C. finmarchicus or T. californicus [33, 34] . The identification of the L. madurae PDP1 genes allowed for the revisitation of the C. finmarchicus and T. californicus transcriptomes for putative homologs. Using the Labidocera PDP1 predicted proteins as queries, related proteins have now been discovered in these two copepod species (A. E. Christie, unpublished) . Moreover, mining of the assembly led to the prediction of a novel isoform of PDH, NSEMLHILRSMPKDMGKIIRNamide, which is just the second member of this peptide family identified from a copepod [37] , a peptide that may serve as an output signal from the Labidocera clock for controlling its physiology and behavior. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186794.t005",

                "text": "Identification of differentially expressed genes between L. madurae developmental stages. The generation of a transcriptome that provides robust results for gene expression profiling is key for application to physiological ecology. While sequenced and annotated genomes are used as reference in model species, de novo assembled transcriptomes, in combination with bioinformatic tools for annotation and statistical testing, provide a powerful alternative. However, for a transcriptome of a non-model species to be used as an alternative for a genome, it needs to be of high quality and complete. Here, we compare four strategies for obtaining a reference for read mapping and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). While the full transcriptome (211,002 transcripts) is optimal for targeted gene discovery, including the identification of genetic variants (i.e., splice variants, indels, SNPs), it also generates a large percentage of ambiguous mapping that could affect statistical testing. In addition to the full transcriptome (\"Full\"), we generated three alternative \"reference\" transcriptomes from the \"Full\" assembly by: 1) selecting the longest transcript for Trinity predicted genes (unique TR#_c#_g#; \"Pred. genes\"); 2) selecting only transcripts with coding regions (CDS) (\"Full-CDS\"); and 3) selecting only transcripts with coding regions (CDS) from the \"Trinity predicted genes\" transcriptome (\"Pred. genes-CDS\"). Table 6 shows the effects of applying these filters. The number of transcripts decreased from 211K to 45K in the smallest \"reference\". Nevertheless, the four transcriptomes were comparable with respect to the number of core eukaryotic proteins, which declined only by 3% between the full and the Trinity-predicted \"unique\" gene transcriptomes (\"Pred. gene\", \"Pred. gene-CDS\"). With the exception of the full transcriptome, the number of duplicated genes (genes with more then one copy) was low (< 0.5%). The percentage of mapped reads using Bowtie decreased from 91% to 68% between the Full and Pred. genes-CDS references Furthermore, the three derived reference transcriptomes had fewer ambiguous reads than the full transcriptome, and the \"unique gene\" approach led to the lowest number of reads mapped more than once (14% and 6% for \"Pred. genes\" and \"Pred. genes-CDS\", respectively). Differences among these potential \"reference transcriptomes\" were further evaluated by testing for differential gene expression between copepodites and adult females. Thus, we mapped reads to the four \"reference transcriptomes\" using two different bioinformatics tools (Bowtie and kallisto) followed by statistical testing to DEGs (edgeR). While the number of counts (= mapped reads) associated with each transcript is higher in Bowtie than in kallisto, this did not affect the number of transcripts tested for relative gene expression after applying the 1 cpm filter ( Table 6 ). The number of DEGs identified by edgeR using counts generated by Bowtie varied by more than a factor of two among the references used. Nevertheless, 8,970 DEGs were shared among the four references (S4 Fig) . In contrast, the number of DEGs identified with kallisto was similar for all four transcriptomes (Table 6) , with 6,229 shared among all references (Fig 7) . A comparison between Bowtie and kallisto of the shared DEGs identified 5,438 common DEGs (S4 Fig) . The smallest reference transcriptome (\"Pred. genes-CDS\") had best agreement between Bowtie and kallisto with 9,827 shared DEGs, which represented approximately 89% (kallisto) and 77% (Bowtie) of identified DEGs, which is not surprising given that this transcriptome had the smallest number of ambiguous reads (S4 Fig) . In general, mapping by kallisto is more conservative, making it the preferred mapping program for the identification of DEGs, in particular in association with an assembly program like Trinity, which is designed to preserve isoform variants [24] .",

Inconsistent results across reference transcriptomes are typically associated with transcripts belonging to genes with multiple isoforms, such as those with predicted splice variants. Thus, independent of the method used for generating a reference transcriptome, it is important to assess the number of isoforms for each differentially expressed gene.",

Thus, transcriptomics can now be used to investigate the eco-physiology of key species within the context of life history strategies, population cycles and ecosystem dynamics. However, these types of studies, which involve gene expression profiling, depend on good reference transcriptomes. Application of multiple workflows to evaluate the quality and completeness of a transcriptome generated for the copepod L. madurae demonstrates that no single criterion is sufficient to assess a de novo assembly. High-throughput bioinformatics tools were used to identify transcripts with protein coding regions and provide annotations. Targeted gene discovery provided information on completeness of individual genes, identified possible sources of fragmentation, established predicted gene variants, and provided additional annotations. The analysis of four different strategies for generating a reference for gene expression studies suggest good agreement among references when a predicted gene assembled into a single isoform. However, many predicted genes include a multiplicity of isoforms, and when these are included in the reference they contribute to ambiguous mapping. Thus, one source of disagreement among transcriptomes in the identification of DEGs is related to which genes are regulated, and weather they are represented by multiple isoforms. The workflows developed in this study if used in a routine assessment of de novo transcriptomes would enhance the reliability of gene expression studies.",

Diagram at top shows the four wellconserved domains (DI-DIV) bridged by less-well-conserved loops. Conserved domains are depicted vertically expanded to show approximate locations of six trans-membrane \u03b1-helical segments (colored bands labeled S1, S2-S6). Sodium-selectivity of the Na V 1 transcripts (but not Na V 2) is confirmed by the occurrence of four characteristic amino acids (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine and alanine [DEKA]) in specific locations termed the \"P-loops\"[31]. Coverage by variants of three putative genes, Labma Na V 1.1 Labma Na V 1.2 and Labma Na V 2 indicated by bars labeled with the i number assigned by Trinity. For Labma Na V 1.1, no one sequence possessed all of the pieces (putative exons), so the overall span across the diagram represents a manual reconstruction generated by including all of the pieces from the different i's. Gaps in sequences are indicated by fine dotted lines. Identical 5' (504 nucleotide) UTRs for i1-i7 have been omitted, as have the identical 3' UTRs (1518 nucleotides) of i1 and i2. Within each gene, corresponding residues across different i's were identical (reflected in the same coloration of the bars) in almost all cases, except for the splice variant indicated in red for Na V 1.1 i3. Sequences representing partial predicted proteins not initiated by an M at the N-terminal or terminated by a stop codon (\"X\" above the bar) at the C-terminal are indicated with a short diagonal bar. Positions of the domains for Na V 2 differ somewhat from those of Na V 1 shown in the top diagram and are indicated by thickening of the bars. Two sites of putative splice variation (Site I and II) are indicated below the Na V 1.1 diagram, and one non-optional segment within Site I is designated \"1\" (96aa). Arrows in the Na V 2 diagram indicate short optional pieces (gaps in the horizontal bars), and the overlap region between the two pairs of isoforms of 44 identical amino acids (aa) is indicated.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186794.g004",

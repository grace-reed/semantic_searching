    "abstract": "This study investigates potential causes of a novel blister-like syndrome in the plating coral Echinopora lamellosa. Visual inspections of this novel coral syndrome showed no obvious signs of macroparasites and the blisters themselves manifested as fluid-filled sacs on the surface of the coral, which rose from the coenosarc between the coral polyps. Histological analysis of the blisters showed that there was no associated necrosis with the epidermal or gastrodermal tissues. The only difference between blistered areas and apparently healthy tissues was the presence of proliferated growth (possible mucosal cell hyperplasia) directly at the blister interface (area between where the edge of the blister joined apparently healthy tissue). No bacterial aggregates were identified in any histological samples, nor any sign of tissue necrosis identified. We conclude, that the blister formations are not apparently caused by a specific microbial infection, but instead may be the result of irritation following growth anomalies of the epidermis. However, future work should be conducted to search for other potential casual agents, including viruses.",

These diseases include: coral bleaching, white plagues, white syndromes, yellow band diseases, black band disease, coral ciliate infections, fungal infections and growth anomalies. Most commonly, coral diseases are attributed to bacterial pathogens, such as cyanobacteria in Black Band Disease [2] [3] [4] [5] and a Vibrio consortium in Yellow Band Disease [6, 7] . Other pathogenic agents in corals receive considerably less attention but include ciliates, associated with Brown Band Disease [8, 9] , White Syndrome [8] , Skeletal Eroding Band [10, 11] and the Caribbean Ciliate Infection [12] , and fungal pathogens associated with Dark Spot Syndrome [13] and Aspergillosis in gorgonian sea fans [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

[18] described the appearance of 8 varying types of growth anomaly existing in corals belonging to the genera Acropora alone, highlighting the importance of this syndrome to the health of corals. Predominantly, those studies which focus on this area of research appear to largely pertain to irregularities in skeletal growth [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , with few reports on associated hyperplasia and hypertrophy [18] [19] [20] 25] . Although focus on coral disease in the wild is currently high, research on aquarium coral diseases is severely lacking in the scientific literature, as highlighted by the recent review, Sweet et al. [26] . Although published reports of aquarium diseases are rare, there is a substantial amount of anecdotal reports of novel diseases by hobbyists and aquarium curators [27] . One such disease or syndrome is blistering of the epidermis. These blisters are thought to only affect the epidermis, appearing as raised 'sacs' (up to ,1 cm 2 ) on the surface of the coral. These 'blisters' often rupture, and a disease, similar in appearance to the wild type known as White Syndrome' [26] occurs, often resulting in the loss of whole colonies.",

Further samples were divided and placed in 5% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis and 100% ethanol for microbial analysis (see below). Whole corals samples were collected and separated into healthy non-affected coral separate from the blistered coral (H); apparently healthy skeleton and tissue 1 cm away but adjacent from a blister (AH); and the blister (B) itself. AH and B tissues were sourced from only two colonies of E. lamellosa as these were the only corals which were showing signs of the syndrome.

The products of each reamplified band were then verified by agarose gel electrophoresis [1% (w/v) agarose] with ethidium bromide staining and visualised using a UV transilluminator. PCR products were then purified using the QIAGEN PCR Purification Kit (see main methods section for complete description) and then labelled using a Big Dye (Applied Biosystems) transformation sequence kit and sent to Genevision (University of Newcastle) for sequencing.

The main difference between sample types was the presence of growth anomalies (GA) within all survey sections of blister-affected samples (Fig. 3a, 3d ). GAs appear to be morphologically similar to the coral mucocyte layer, with minute vesicles (,0.5-1 mm in length) appearing therein and striations within the layer (Fig. 2a, 2d, 3a, 3d) . Growth appeared to start from a centralised area (dashed arrow) and proliferate outwards (illustrating a possible hyperplasia), filling free spaces and pressing up against apparently healthy tissue (Fig. 3a, 3d ). Furthermore, separation of the epithelium from the underlying tissue revealing a cleft was apparent, likely resulting in the formation of a blister (Fig. 3a) . Sections stained with acridine orange only exhibit fluorescence in the nuclei of zooxanthellae and host cells, as well as at sites of coral mucus (Figs. 2b, 2e, 3b, 3e) . No tissue sections were found to test positive for signs of tissue necrosis (Fig. 2c, 2f, 3c, 3f ).",

                "text": "This is the first study to describe a blister-like syndrome in the scleractinian coral Echinopora lamellosa. Histological analysis showed the epidermis of blister-affected samples was found to be similar to that of healthy samples, with the corals Symbiodinium, appearing to remain intact and blistered tissues showing no signs of necrosis. Given that acridine orange only appeared to show autofluorescence of coral, zooxanthellae and coral mucus, there were no microbial associates present within the blistered tissues, highlighting that in contrast to many other coral diseases [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 10, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 27, 58, 59] , this syndrome is unlikely caused by microbial pathogens. Instead, all blistered sections exhibited growth anomalies of the coral tissue (GAs) that appeared morphologically similar to the mucocyte layer of the epidermis. The main visual difference between GAs and the regular epidermis is that the GAs appear to grow outwards from a central point, with GAs possibly being an occurrence of hyperplasia in mucosal cells. This could potentially compromise healthy tissue as contact is made, resulting in irritation of the tissues and the formation of the blisters themselves. Based on comparative staining and comparisons with healthy tissue, GAs appear to show small aggregations of mucus, a multitude of tiny vesicles and striations within the tissue, similar to that found in association with mucocytes in regular coral epidermis. The growth anomalies seen here in E. lamellosa differ from those reported in most other scleractinian corals, with reports of previous growth anomalies often including proliferated skeletal growth, resulting in nodular, exophytic calices [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . These reports also state that tissue overlying skeletal growth anomalies is translucent (lacking zooxanthellae), whereas the blisters in this study maintain the same pigmentation to the surrounding apparently healthy tissue (with zooxanthellae appearing normal in histological sections of blister-affected tissues). Growth anomalies of the encrusting coral Montipora efflorescens have differed from this, being described as low-lying, umbonate growths (based on nomenclature for describing growth anomalies outlined by Work and Aeby [45] ), but still pertain to the coral skeleton [38] . The growth anomalies found in E. lamellosa do not appear to include exophytic growth of the underlying skeleton. Hyperplasia has previously been associated with growth anomalies in scleractinian corals, with previous reports identifying hyperplasia in the basal body wall [38, 42] . Again, this differs to the observed hyperplasia in E. lamellosa in this study, with hyperplasia appearing to take place in the epidermal layer, potentially occurring in mucosal cells. Furthermore, hyperplasia in the encrusting coral Montipora spp has been found to be associated with microalgae in some instances [38] . However no invasive microalgae were identified in E. lamellosa exhibiting growth anomalies. Interestingly, reports of hyperplasia in soft corals on the other hand, has been found to take place in the coenenchyme, between polyps (the region in which blisters were found to occur here in E. lamellosa), but in soft corals, Williams et al [38] also found a distinct necrotizing component associated with growth anomalies (not found in E. lamellosa).",

In this study, the dominant prokaryotic community was not found to shift significantly between different health states, which is in contrast to other coral disease studies [8, [47] [48] [49] . Only four bacterial ribotypes were present in healthy E. lamellosa samples and absent in both the apparently healthy tissues and the blistered samples. These included ribotypes closely related to a Desulfotomaculum species, a Mesorhizobium species, a Chloroflexus species and a Pseudomonas species. The Desulfotomaculum and Mesorhizobium-related species had relatively high abundance in healthy samples and thus a loss of these species from the coral-associated community may be of particular importance to coral health and function within the holobiont. Interestingly, Desulfotomaculum spp are spore forming sulphate-reducing bacteria that have previously been associated with black band disease in scleractinian corals [50, 51] , despite their association with only healthy tissue in this study. A Mesorhizobium sp has been associated with healthy scleractinian corals in the past [52] , with this bacterium considered to have a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing relationship within the host coral [53] . Furthermore, Littman et al. [54] found Mesorhizobium sp to be specifically associated with the corals algal symbionts, the Symbiodinium that reside within the host coral, indicating that this symbiotic nitrogen-fixing association may actually be formed specifically between the Symbiodinium and the bacteria Mesorhizobium.",

Added to the association of viruses implicated in tumour formation in other marine organisms [59] , including fibropapillomatosis in marine turtles [60] [61] [62] [63] and a plethora of fish tumours [64, 65] , there exists the potential that GAs in scleractinian corals may be the result of a viral infection [55, 66, 67] .

This suggests the structure of the coral skeleton may be impaired, with similar finds (such as a finer skeletal structure and lower skeletal density) being reported in other scleractinian corals exhibiting growth anomalies [42] [43] [44] 68] . Thus, focus on skeletal effects of coral blisters warrants further investigation. To conclude, this is the first study to highlight the appearance of soft tissue growth anomalies in aquarium corals and highlights that the syndrome is unlikely to be the result of a microbial pathogenic agent (bacteria, fungi, protozoan or algae). More likely the blister formation appears to be the result of growth anomalies resulting from irregular epidermal growth. As these blisters have been shown to be a precursor to instances of diseases such as White Syndrome, there is an obvious need to increase our understanding of this syndrome in both aquarium systems and in the wild. Future work should focus on further isolation and understanding of similar blister-like pathologies in other scleractinian coral species. ",

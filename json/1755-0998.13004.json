Initial analyses have used operational taxonomic unit (OTU) approaches to collapse sequence diversity at a 97% similarity threshold (Arif et al., 2014; Cunning et al., 2017 ). Yet other approaches have combined OTU analyses with searches for key ITS2 type-defining sequences in attempts to better exploit the data (Ziegler et al., 2017) . Most recently, a minimum entropy decomposition (MED)-based approach (referred to as the metahaplotype approach) has been used to consolidate the high diversity to a smaller set of core sequence nodes, based on biologically informative sequence positions rather than the fixed similarity thresholds of the OTU approach (Eren et al., 2015; Smith, Ketchum et al., 2017b) .",

As numerous Symbiodiniaceae species share the same most abundant ITS2 sequence, and a 1-bp difference in this most abundant sequence may relate to evolutionary divergences of >10 million years (Thornhill, Lewis, Wham, & LaJeunesse, 2014) , the fixed similarity threshold clustering of OTU approaches greatly limits their ability to maintain informative intragenomic structure and thus, resolve Symbiodiniaceae taxa. In contrast, the metahaplotype approach (Smith, Ketchum et al., 2017b) does retain intragenomic diversity information. However, it does not differentiate between intra-and intergenomic diversity and is thus limited to scenarios where samples only contain a single symbiont taxon (Smith, Ketchum et al., 2017b) . To verify this single symbiont assumption, the method is reliant on an additional less conserved marker, the chloroplastic psbA noncoding region (psbA ncr ), a marker often used to differentiate between closely related Symbiodiniaceae taxa (LaJeunesse & Thornhill, 2011) . While this marker may appear to be an attractive alternative to the ITS2 region due to its power to resolve closely related taxa, its highly variable nature severely limits the taxonomic range over which returned sequences can be aligned, and therefore it is effective only for reconstructing fine-level phylogenies among closely related taxa (Thornhill et al., 2014) .",

The analysis does this by identifying specific sets of 'defining intragenomic [ITS2 sequence] variants' (DIVs) that represent the taxonomic unit of SymPortal, the 'ITS2 type profile' (a term derived from the 'ITS2 types' defined by 'ITS2 profiles' in DGGE-based methodologies). The database with which the SymPortal analysis is integrated stores sequencing information from every previously conducted SymPortal analysis. With continued use, the SymPortal framework will therefore accrue a catalog of ITS2 type profiles representative of identified putative Symbiodiniaceae taxa.",

                "text": "Whilst several different Symbiodiniaceae taxa may be harboured by an individual coral, commonly only a single Symbiodiniaceae taxon is found to be predominant (Baums, Devlin-Durante, & Lajeunesse, 2014; Goulet & Coffroth, 2003; Pettay, Wham, Pinzon, & Lajeunesse, 2011; Thornhill, Xiang, Fitt, & Santos, 2009) . In cases where multiple Symbiodiniaceae are harboured by a single coral, these taxa are usually from different genera. Nevertheless, although rare, individual corals may harbour multiple Symbiodiniaceae taxa from the same genera. SymPortal must therefore be able to differentiate between intra-and intergenomic sources of ITS2 sequence variants returned from sample amplicon libraries (Arif et al., 2014; Cunning et al., 2017; Thornhill et al., 2007) . To achieve this, SymPortal applies a central principle: the probability that a given set of ITS2 sequences found in a single coral sample are representative of a single Symbiodiniaceae genotype increases with the number of samples that set is found in (Figure 1c ). Key to this principle is that although distinct coral colonies may contain DNA from millions of individual Symbiodiniaceae cells, when considered on a genus by genus basis (ITS2 sequences from Symbiodiniaceae taxa of different genera are genetically diverse and mostly unalignable), the vast majority of the cells are usually of a single genotype (Baums et al., 2014; Goulet & Coffroth, 2003; Pettay et al., 2011; Thornhill et al., 2009) . On the rare occasions when multiple taxa belonging to the same genus are found within a single sample, these taxa may be successfully resolved using SymPortal when each of them is present in other samples as standalone taxa. This principle has been used in DGGE-based methodologies to successfully identify genetically distinct Symbiodiniaceae taxa that have been verified by additional genetic markers (LaJeunesse & Thornhill, 2011; LaJeunesse et al., 2014; Sampayo et al., 2009 ).",

Sampling: (ai) Field sampling: corals containing populations of Symbiodiniaceae are sampled. (aii) Each Symbiodiniaceae cell contains hundreds of copies of the ITS2 gene representing many unique sequences (intragenomic sequence diversity). In this example, three corals are sampled, each containing a single genetically differentiated population of Symbiodiniaceae. PCR library preparation and sequencing: (bi) genomic DNA is extracted from each sample, the ITS2 region is PCR-amplified and PCR libraries are prepared for sequencing through clean-up and adapter ligation. (bii) Prepared libraries are sequenced on the Illumina platform producing, (biii) raw sequencing reads in paired.fastq.gz format. SymPortal analysis: (ci) paired.fastq.gz files are quality control processed and loaded into the SymPortal framework's database before being run through the SymPortal analysis. (cii) During the analysis, re-occurring sets of ITS2 sequences are identified as 'defining intragenomic [ITS2 sequence] variants' (DIVs) that are used to define novel or pre-existing, taxa-representative, ITS2 type profiles. (ciii) tab-delimited count tables are output detailing the abundance of predicted ITS2 type profiles and post-quality control sequences found in each sample. A .fasta is also provided detailing nucleotide sequence information. Finally, clade-separated UniFrac distance matrices and calculated principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) coordinates are output for betweensample and between-ITS2 type profile pairwise comparisons [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] ",

This approach was applied to Symbiodiniaceae ITS2 DNA to collapse intragenomic sequence variability and to be able to resolve ecologically discrete entities (Arif et al., 2014) . The 97% threshold was applied to Symbiodiniaceae due to its documented ability to collapse all ITS2 diversity in monoclonal cultures of Symbiodiniaceae (Arif et al., 2014 ). In the approach described by Arif et al. (2014) , sequences recovered from all samples are split by genus, pooled and clustered into OTUs. Representative sequences are then associated with each of the OTUs. More recently, a modification to this method was proposed by Cunning et al. (2017) in which sequences are still clustered at a 97% similarity cutoff but on a sample-by-sample basis rather than across all samples. This more recent approach was developed to address the fact that the most abundant ITS2 sequences from different Symbiodiniaceae species may be more similar to one another than the intragenomic variants found within those species (Arif et al., 2014; Cunning et al., 2017) .",

For example, DIVs used to differentiate between different ITS2 type profiles may be found at relatively low abundances (~<5%; Figure 3 ). Such sequences would previously have been below detection limits. As such, taxonomic inferences afforded by these DIVs would not have been achievable (Hume et al., 2015; Smith, Hume et al., 2017a) . with the taxa (e.g. C1, A1). However, more recent descriptions contain information relating to additional ITS2 sequence variants that are instrumental in identifying the taxa in question using the ITS2 marker (e.g. Hume et al., 2015; Hume et al., 2016; LaJeunesse et al., 2014) . Indeed, we see that ITS2 sequences referred to in such descriptions (e.g. For example, many early analyses reported only to the clade (genus) level, which may be compared directly to SymPortal's 'clade' output (see Section 2.3.6 for further details). More recently, samples were often assigned to a 'type,' a somewhat ambiguous term, often related to the most abundant sequence, or sequences, found in a sample. Such findings will be comparable using the 'Majority ITS2 sequence' output of SymPortal. Previously used OTU clustering approaches may also be compared: those approaches that cluster within samples may be approximated to identifying the most abundant sequences of samples (therefore comparable again to the 'Majority ITS2 sequence' output), and those that cluster across samples may be compared by searching for OTU representative sequences amongst ITS2 type profile DIVs. With time, the new Symbiodiniaceae systematics will also be fully integrated into the SymPortal outputs to ensure both forward and reverse comparability of studies analysed through the SymPortal framework.",

As such it would appear that the resolution offered by SymPortal is probably biologically significant. Importantly, it should be noted that Symbiodiniaceae taxa to date have been classified at a coarser resolution than is used here, either with alternative markers (e.g. Picciani, de Lossio e Seiblitz, de Paiva, e Castro, & Zilberberg, 2016; Thomas, Kendrick, Kennington, Richards, & Stat, 2014) or with alternative means of analysis using the ITS2 marker (Howells, Abrego, Meyer, Kirk, & Burt, 2016; Hume et al., 2013) . Given the biologically meaningful finer scale resolutions presented through the use of the SymPortal framework, generalizations based on these coarser resolutions should be exercised with care, as exceptions to these generalizations may simply be unresolved, if derived from more traditional classification approaches (e.g. Symbiodiniaceae containing the C3 sequence as their majority sequence are generally considered to be thermally sensitive). Yet, C. thermophilum, the predominant algal symbiont harboured by corals surviving in the world's hottest sea, the Persian/Arabian Gulf, also has a most abundant sequence of C3 (Howells et al., 2016; Hume et al., 2013; Smith, Vaughan et al., 2017c) .

                "text": "The central analytical principle that the SymPortal and DGGEbased analyses are built on has some inherent limitations. The principle relies on identifying re-occurring sets (found in multiple samples) of ITS2 sequences with the understanding that the more commonly a set of sequences occurs, the more likely that set of sequences is representative of a single taxon (LaJeunesse, 2001 (LaJeunesse, , 2002 . However, although rare, it is possible that Symbiodiniaceae taxa co-occur in a sufficient number of samples that the ITS2 sequences returned from several taxa may be documented as being representative of a single taxon. In the analyses that have already been completed, such 'super types' have been a very rare occurrence with only one detected case so far. In this study (unpublished), an ITS2 type profile was generated by SymPortal that was co-dominant for the C15 and C3 sequences. This ITS2 type profile was easily diagnosed as a 'super type' due to its profile being a combination of two ITS2 type profiles also identified in the same study (one C3 radiation ITS2 type profile, and one C15 radiation ITS2 type profile). In cases where these super types have been identified, mitigations to their specific instances have been incorporated into the SymPortal algorithms directly to prevent their propagation and re-occurrence. In the future, however, a median joining network-based approach will probably be used to assess whether co-occurring sets of sequences may represent several taxa. Sequence collections will be assessed to see whether they form contiguous networks characteristic of a single taxon's profile, or whether multiple discrete radiations exist, probably characteristic of multiple taxa. Another limitation occurs when trying to quantify the abundances of closely related symbiont taxa (taxa that share the same most abundant ITS2 sequence) found in the same sample. In such cases, where several taxa in a single sample have some of the same DIVs in common, it is extremely difficult to partition what proportions of each of the DIVs are representative of which taxa (as it would be for any other approach given the nature of the problem).",

Outside of the host, Symbiodiniaceae populations are free from any host-selective influence and might therefore be more evenly distributed. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that a single Symbiodiniaceae taxon will be prevalent in a sample from the environment, an assumption required for SymPortal to be able to successfully identify ITS2 type profiles of putative taxa (Thornhill et al., 2017 , and references therein). However, as mentioned previously, with continued use, SymPortal will accrue a catalogue of ITS2 type profiles representative of identified putative Symbiodiniaceae taxa. This catalogue of defining ITS2 type profiles may be applied to ITS2 amplicon libraries from environmental samples to predict the presence of Symbiodiniaceae that have already been identified in animal hosts. However, given the breakdown of the aforementioned assumption in these free-living environments, it is unlikely to be straightforward to identify previously unaccounted putative taxa de novo from environmental samples. Notably, many of the free-living taxa may not form stable associations with hosts (Thornhill et al., 2017) . Besides attempting to use additional markers to attain a finer scale resolution in free-living samples, another option would be to extract, culture, sequence and characterize monoclonal strains found in such samples (sensu Arif et al., 2014) . While host-associating Symbiodiniaceae can be notoriously difficult to culture, free-living Symbiodiniaceae are often more readily cultured (Krueger & Gates, 2012; LaJeunesse, 2002; Santos, Taylor, & Coffroth, 2001 ). Once cultured, monoclonal lines may be sequenced and their ITS2 type profiles directly submitted to the SymPortal database to enable their identification in subsequent analyses.",

Between these genera, ITS2 sequences are mostly unalignable. Therefore, as a precursor to all analyses, sequence data are separated by genus/clade before subsequent analysis of ITS2 type profiles. The genus-/clade-separated data are then merged back together before final output with abundances of predicted ITS2 type profiles adjusted relative to the preseparation proportions (Figure 2). Samples may also contain multiple Symbiodiniaceae populations from the same genus, and each can make up a considerable proportion of the host's algal symbiont complement. SymPortal is able to identify multiple ITS2 type profiles of the same genus within a given sample as long as each of the ITS2 type profiles has been found as the sole ITS2 type profile in another sample, such as C3-C3a-C3ab and C15-C15x in Figure 2 (see Section 2.3.6, SymPortal output, for an explanation of ITS2 type profile systematics).",

(2017b) data set (three coral species with 13-15 samples for each coral species). The comparison demonstrates the ability of both methods to resolve between closely related (i.e. the same most common ITS2 sequence) Symbiodiniaceae taxa. From left to right, plots represent progress in each analysis: (ai, bi) raw sequence data, (aii) post-quality control (QC) and minimum entropy decomposition analyses (MED), (bii) post-QC and 97% similarity clustering, (aiii) determination of ITS2 type profiles through the identification of defining intragenomic sequence variants (DIVs), and (biii) identification and annotation of representative OTUs. In all plots, each stacked bar column represents a single sample with each individual bar representing either the proportion of a single ITS2 sequence relative to the total abundance of sequences in that sample or the relative abundance of ITS2 type profiles identified in each sample (plot aiii only). Notably, SymPortal ITS2 type profiles determine distinct Symbiodiniaceae taxa associated with distinct hosts, whereas a 97% OTU approach suggests the same symbiont is associated with all hosts.

The only sample to return an ITS2 type profile designation different from other samples of the same host origin was sample A08. The visually different ITS2 sequence profile of this sample (in the ordination and sequence profiles), as well as the conservative C3 ITS2 type profile designation of SymPortal, are in agreement with its disparate psbA ncr sequence (differing from the consensus by three indels across four nucleotides).Within the other two host species, the maximum divergence from the psbA ncr consensus sequence was by two separate single nucleotide indels. Whilst only one of the Cyphastrea samples differed from the consensus, four of the Platygyra samples returned different ps-bA ncr sequences, three of which had the same indel. Although none of these samples were designated as unique ITS2 type profiles, ordination of the ITS2 profiles did suggest some grouping of the samples that returned the same psbA ncr indel (Figure S4",

Just as these more recent descriptions have exploited improvements in scientific understanding and sequencing power to offer more finescale resolution, the improved resolution of the SymPortal framework should also be incorporated into taxonomic descriptions where appropriate. Where a unique ITS2 type profile is able to identify a discrete Symbiodiniaceae taxon, incorporating information relating to its characterizing DIVs into its description will increase the ease with which taxa may be identified. Of course, further subdivisions of Symbiodiniaceae taxa proposed by differentiated ITS2 type profiles will need to be corroborated with additional supporting evidence. This may take the form of fine-scale genetic markers such as the chloroplastic psbA ncr and microsatellite flanking sequences, biogeographical data such as specific host-species fidelities or physical distributions, or correlations of genetic divisions to host or symbiont physiological measurements. Aside from considering how taxonomic descriptions may be advanced, it is equally important to consider how the outputted resolutions of SymPortal may be evaluated in relation to previous analyses that used alternative methods of analysis in conjunction with the ITS2 marker. By reporting all levels of resolution from the coarser to the finer scale, namely clade, most abundant sequence, putative species and ITS2 type profile, the SymPortal output enables researchers to work at the most appropriate level for their investigation, while maintaining the ability to compare with previous studies.",

Once no further multimodal distributions are identified, the ITS2 sequences of the separated sets of ITS2 sequences are considered DIVs. In this way, it is possible for different ITS2 type profiles to contain exactly the same collection of DIVs but at different abundances. At this point, the relative abundances of the ITS2 type profile's DIVs within all the samples they were found in are then used to characterize the ITS2 type profile. Therefore, when searching for ITS2 type profiles within samples, a match is only considered if all of the characterizing DIVs are found, and these have relative abundances that fall within the abundance ranges determined during characterization of the given ITS2 type profile."

Has foreign key relationships to CladeCollection and AnalysisType a aThe clade system of taxonomic division within the former genus Symbiodinium has now been superseded by new family-and genera-level descriptions(LaJeunesse et al., 2018). In the interest of maintaining reverse comparability to previous studies, SymPortal will continue to relate its outputs to the clade divisions. In time SymPortal will also be updated to include the new Symbiodiniaceae organization.Irrespective of whether analyses are run locally or remotely via SymPortal.org, the sequencing information of every data set analysed by SymPortal is stored in the associated database. This sequencing information is stored when a data set is loaded into a SymPortal database instance(Table 1) and when analyses are run(Table 2). Remotely run analyses will use the remote SymPortal database, while local analyses will use a locally defined database. All database instances are integrated into the Python-scripted analysis through the Django API (https://www.djangoproject.com/). In this way, the sequencing information from all previously analysed samples is accessible for use in future analyses.In addition to storing detailed sequencing information for each submitted data set, the database also stores details of all completed analyses(Table 2). Analysis details, such as which ITS2 type profiles were found and which DIVs characterize those profiles, are associated with the respective sequencing information, e.g. which samples the ITS2 type profiles were found in, and which of the samples'sequences were identified as DIVs. The remotely hosted SymPortal database therefore represents a powerful analytical and reference resource, effectively accruing a catalogue of global Symbiodiniaceae diversity as the number of samples analysed grows. With every new data set submitted to the SymPortal framework's database, the amount of sequencing information available for use in the SymPortal analysis will increase. Effectively, each sequential analysis will have access to a more resource-rich version of the database.In this way, subtle differences between the identities of the ITS2 type profiles discovered in consecutive analyses may occur as SymPortal's power to resolve improves. As such, when comparing outputs from two different SymPortal analyses, it will be helpful to consider which data sets from the SymPortal database were included in the given analyses. For this reason, every analysis count table output will provide the unique database identifier (UID) of the analysis it is related to. From this information, a list of the data sets that were incorporated into the analysis may be generated. However, changes that occur between analyses run against sequential database versions are likely to be small. Samples from different analyses that contain similarITS2 sequence diversities will still have comparable ITS2 type profile designations. At the time of writing, the latest analysis (DataAnalysis UID 44) contained 7,173 samples, representing the sampling efforts of 35 studies (35 DataSet objects). Within these samples, 771 different ITS2 type profiles were identified, representing 10,539 unique ITS2 type profile/sample associations. Importantly, 50% of these unique associations are represented by the 92 most abundant ITS2type profiles (Figure S1). A summary of the database tables held in the"

To give an overview of data submissions and data analyses, plots of sequences and ITS2 type profile abundances across samples as well as graphical representations of the PCoA results are additionally generated for the user (seeFigures S2and S3 as an example).For both count tables (i.e. sequences and IT2 type profiles), the format resembles the OTU count tables commonly used in 16S analyses. Therefore, the format of these tables is ideally suited to be used as direct input to commonly implemented statistical analyses for sequencing diversity and abundance data. The SymPortal out-For a species to be associated with an ITS2 type profile, the ITS2 sequence(s) characteristic of the species, as detailed in its description, must all be found in the list of DIVs that define the ITS2 type profile in question. New species information will be added to the SymPortal database, and therefore associated with outputs, as new descriptions are made. Importantly, this is not a list of species that the ITS2 type profile definitely represents, and it remains the responsibility of the researcher to carefully consider the species descriptions to assess whether the queried sample may be the species in question.Depending on the description, this may require the use of further genetic, morphological, or physiological evidence. This comajority abundance is denoted by the '/' in the ITS2 type profile name.Distance matrices of pairwise comparisons are output fromSymPortal to aid in the quantification of similarity or relatedness between study samples (Files S8 and S10) and ITS2 type profiles (File S6), respectively.

A greater number of samples would be required to elucidate the robustness of this resolution, but it would appear that divergence in the psbA ncr (even as small as a single indel) may also be reflected in the ITS2 marker. Given the hypervariable character of the psbA ncr region in general, and the fact that even closely related taxa may have considerable differences between their most abundant psbA ncr sequence (as evidenced by the between-host species differences seen here), it would appear that exploiting intragenomic ITS2 diversity in phylogenetic resolutions within Symbiodiniaceae enables a resolution comparable to that of psbA ncr (at least when considering the short read sequencing-derived psbA ncr amplicons of the Smith et al. data). Furthermore, because any two ITS2 sequences from the same Symbiodiniaceae clade (A-I) may be aligned, the taxonomic breadth over which comparisons may be made with ITS2 greatly exceeds that of psbA ncr (psbA ncr sequences from the C3 radiation and the C1 radiation are largely unalignable)."

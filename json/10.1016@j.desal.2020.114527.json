In this study, we evaluated for the first time, ecophysiological and cellular responses of brown macroalgae as diagnosis tools to assess environmental impacts of desalination, through transplantation experiments with the cosmopolitan brown alga Ectocarpus. Transplants located at 10 and 30 m from the discharge point of a desalination plant located in Antofagasta, Chile, showed impaired photosynthetic parameters (ETR, Fv/Fm, \u03b1 ETR and ETR max) and oxidative stress responses like accumulation of H 2 O 2 and enhanced lipid peroxidation. Also, increased salinity produced high accumulation of ascorbate but a decrease in glutathione content. Also, genes encoding for enzymes related to salinity tolerance, SOS2, and oxidative stress, SOD, APX, PRX and GR, were highly up-regulated in transplanted Ectocarpus, especially at 10 m from the brine discharge. Altogether, our results demonstrate that Ectocarpus is a sensitive species to brine impacts, and that the transplantation method combined with its physiological and molecular responses are reliable tools to incorporate in environmental monitoring plans to address for desalination brine impacts on coastal ecosystems.",

                "text": "In the last decades, terrestrial water fluxes have been severely affected by direct anthropogenic intervention (e.g. water withdrawals from domestic, agricultural, and industrial activities) [1] . On the other hand, Climate Change driven by massive emissions of greenhouse gases, among others, have been changing the distribution of the weather patterns all over the globe and influencing water cycle dynamics, causing an important impact in water availability and demand worldwide [2, 3] . To address the latter, seawater desalination via reverse osmosis (SWRO), has become a feasible solution, which comprises the removal of salt and minerals from saline water. Nowadays, approximately 7% of the world's population is dependent on desalinated water for daily purposes, but it is expected to grow up to 14% by 2025, and 25% by 2050 (United Nations, 2015, [4] ). However, and despite the important use of desalination, this procedure may cause impacts on coastal ecosystems, since it can generate large quantities of high salinity brines that are usually discharged into the subtidal zone [5, 6] . As brine is denser and twice saline than seawater, it sinks to the bottom and can cause detrimental effects on benthic organisms, mainly through osmotic stress [7, 8] . It has been observed that brine-associated impacts are highly species-and ecosystem-specific; thus, the consequences of brine discharges recorded by research so far cannot be directly extrapolated to the impacts caused by desalination projects worldwide [7] . Moreover, different investigations have evidenced that biological stress mediated by brines is principally related with osmotic stress derived from the excess of salt [9] [10] [11] .",

Available studies demonstrate that the ecological impacts of the hypersaline stream are influenced by several factors including salinity levels, discharge method, dilution rate and tolerance of surrounding marine organism [7, 15] . For example, sensitive benthic fauna has been identified, as certain polychaeta [16] and equinoderms [17] . Also, different brine tolerance ranges were observed in reefbuilding corals species, as well as in associated bacteria; for example, triggering partial coral bleaching [13] . Other study demonstrated that benthic bacteria can be affected by brine effluents in a site-specific manner, where discharge method and local stressors influenced the abundance and diversity of these communities [18] . In photoautotrophs, laboratory approaches have shown that saline excess above 39.1 psu versus control value of 37.5 psu (average Western Mediterranean Sea salinity) results in a reduction of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica vitality, in terms of leaf grow, necrotic spots, and leaves premature senescence; moreover, when exposed to 45 psu, approximately 50% of the seagrasses died in two weeks [19] . Similar results were obtained with the Mediterranean seagrass Cymodocea nodosa, which showed detrimental effects when exposed to increased salinities in laboratory-controlled conditions [20] , and during in situ transplantation nearby brine discharges [21] . Also, field experiments nearby a pilot desalination plant in Spain demonstrated the same tendency as the laboratory experiments, disclosing significant damages on P. oceanica viability (at 38.4 psu) and meadow structure (at 39.1 psu) [22] .",

Considering the important biological role of brown macroalgae as habitat forming organisms (e.g. kelp forests) in temperate coastal rocky shores worldwide, and the lack of knowledge about the potential detrimental impact of the desalination industry on them, it is highlighted as a relevant research subject to understand their response mechanisms to address hypersalinity, as well as to extrapolate those to potential ecological and economic consequences.",

This suggest a possible disruption in the chloroplast electron transport chain, inducing ROS over-production (as evidenced in our H 2 O 2 measurements) [37] . For instance, it has been registered for the unicellular freshwater green microalga Scenedesmus obliquus that different salt concentration (from 0 to 25 psu of NaCl, control salinity 0 psu) generated a decrease in the ETR after 4 days [38] . Similarly, in the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii a significant reduction on the ETR was observed after 100 mM and 300 mM NaCl treatment (~6 and~18 psu, respectively, control salinity 0.02 psu) after 24 h [39] . In our study, we also found that Fv/Fm, \u03b1 ETR , and ETR max were decreased in Ectocarpus samples at both sites tested nearby the brine discharge, at 3 and 7 days, suggesting a brine-derived damage to the antenna complex. This process has been shown to induce impaired photosynthetic efficiency and capacity in macroalgae [40, 41] . In contrast to our results, in the seagrass P. oceanica, Fv/Fm and \u03b1 ETR were not altered at 39, 41 and 43 psu (control salinity 37 psu) during one week of mesocosms experiments [42] , and not even after three months exposed to 43 psu [12] . On the other hand, hypersalinity treatments using brine directly (54 psu) for two weeks in P. australis, showed a significant decrease in Fv/Fm, \u03b1 ETR , and ETR max when compared to control salinity of 37 psu, although this responses were not observed when using diluted brine at 42 and 46 psu [43] . In accordance with our results, Zheng et al. [44] showed that photosynthetic oxygen It is well established and characterized that salt excess can lead to oxidative stress and damage to several macromolecules in plants. Principal reasons include cell dehydration and uncontrolled uptake of Na + , which in turn, disrupt several metabolic pathways that require H 2 O molecules, and changes in ionic state of most enzymes, respectively (e.g. [45, 46] ). We demonstrated that H 2 O 2 was over-accumulated at 3 and 7 days in Ectocarpus transplanted at both 10 and 30 m from the brine discharge, suggesting the induction of an oxidative stress state. Interestingly, H 2 O 2 content was higher in samples of site at 30 m than at 10 m from the brine discharge, suggesting that different saline concentration thresholds are necessary to activate ROS detoxification systems. These systems are regulated by specific ROS amounts, which in turn activate tolerance mechanisms [47] . Indeed, 10 m samples did not showed an increase in TBARS content, suggesting that efficient tolerance mechanisms were activated, such as high ascorbate content and up-regulation of genes related to oxidative stress as evidenced in our results. H 2 O 2 excess can directly catalyse the Fenton reaction, producing the highly oxidising hydroxyl radicals, which rapidly target lipids.",

For instance, exposure to~60 psu for 6 days (control salinity~30 psu) drastically increases H O 2 levels in U. prolifera, which was also correlated with high levels of lipid peroxidation [49] . A recent investigation in the microalga Dunaliella salina evidenced that hypersaline stress beyond 2 M of NaCl (~117 psu, control salinit\u1ef9 15 psu) until exponential growth phase, was accompanied by an increase in intracellular total ROS content [50] .",

                "text": "To counteract oxidative damage, photoautotrophs have evolved developing a large battery of antioxidant molecules, such as glutathione and ascorbate, which interact closely in the Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle [51] . Dissimilar patterns were observed between total glutathione and ascorbate at 3 days of transplantation experiments, trend that was maintained after 7 days in 10 m samples. While the highest total glutathione was recorded in 30 m samples, in the case of total ascorbate this was observed at 10 m from the brine outfall. The latter could be explained by a distinct salinity-dependent activation of de novo synthesis and recycling of these metabolites [46] . Although different magnitudes of salt concentration were used by Lu et al. [48] , similar responses were registered in U. fasciata after 24 h of hypersalinity treatments of~60 and~90 psu (control salinity~30 psu), with increased and decreased content of total glutathione and ascorbate, respectively. Furthermore, similarly to Ectocarpus transplants at 30 m from the discharge, high salinity conditions (~60 psu for 6 days) triggers a rapid accumulation of total glutathione but not of ascorbate pools in U. prolifera [49] . These responses are also accompanied by an increase in the activities of enzymes that occupy these molecules as substrates to neutralize ROS, such as GR and APX, indirectly suggesting changing rates in GSH/GSSG and ASC/DHA ratios [48, 49] . Indeed, the predominance of the oxidized forms of glutathione and ascorbate, was a marked trend in all the samples at all treatments, supporting an oxidative stress scenario. Although, there are no studies accounting for GSH/GSSG and ASC/DHA under hypersaline treatments in macroalgae, other abiotic stresses, such as copper excess, have revealed severe changes in these antioxidant molecules ratios in Ectocarpus, through laboratory and field assessments [25, 26] , where accumulation of oxidized forms of glutathione and ascorbate were the major tendency.",

In our study, we observed that SOS2, involved in signalling under salt stress, was up-regulated in Ectocarpus transplants at 10 and 30 m from the brine discharge, but only at 3 days of experiments, suggesting the time-frame specificity of SOS2 in an early induction for the activation of the hypersalinity-tolerance response in Ectocarpus. There are no reports evaluating the expression of the SOS genes in aquatic photoautotroph. However, studies in Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated that SOS1 was overexpressed under 100 mM NaCl (~8 psu, control salinity~1.5 psu) for three weeks [53] . Also, SOS1, SOS2 and SOS3 showed up-regulation in different tissues of A. thaliana roots when exposed for 5 days to 140 mM NaCl (~8 psu, control salinity~1.5 psu) [54] . Regarding the expression of oxidative stress enzymes, there was a notorious up-regulation of all transcripts in Ectocarpus transplanted at 10 m from the brine discharge, pattern observed at 3 and 7 days of experiments, which is also in agreement with all oxidative stress, damage and antioxidant responses recorded as part of this investigation. Although, transcripts levels in samples located at 10 m from the brine discharge were maintained high in comparison with control samples, at 7 days they decreased significantly in almost all cases, suggesting the beginning of an acclimation process, where translated enzymes content were enough to counteract oxidative stress or that other set of genes are necessary for the late tolerance response. Interestingly, transcript levels at 30 m Ectocarpus did not demonstrate changes in expression profile patterns, supporting the hypothesis of the need to reach certain ROS stress thresholds to induce the expression of these genes. In U. fasciata, an increase in the transcripts SOD, APX and GR was evidenced upon hypersalinity stress (~90 psu, control salinity 30 psu) after 3 h [55] . Likewise, SOD and APX were overexpressed in P. yezoensis after high salt stress (~6 psu, control salinity~0.6 psu) for 12 h [56] . Other study demonstrated that transcription of PRX1 and PRX2, from the halotolerant alga Dunaliella viridis, can be differentially up-regulated after hypersalinity shock of 3 M of NaCl (~175 psu, control salinity~58 psu) after 48 h and 6 h, respectively [57] . Encompassing all our results, it is evident that an average salinity of~37 psu at 10 m from the brine discharge pipe is enough to activate transcriptional machinery of antioxidant enzymes in Ectocarpus.",

In this sense, we suggest that the best physiological and molecular biomarkers for Ectocarpus transplants include: photosynthetic parameters such as Fv/Fm, \u03b1 ETR , and ETR max ; oxidative stress parameters as H O 2 and glutathione and ascorbate content (and redox status); and gene expression profiles of genes related to oxidative and salt stress. In this regard, Ectocarpus transplants nearby a brine discharge can display physiological metabolic responses that highlight the biological effects of salinity excess. This approach not only contribute to understand mechanisms of tolerance to hypersalinity and brine discharges in macroalgae, but also highlight the Ectocarpus transplantation protocol and measurements as valuable tools for environmental biotechnology to address diagnosis, prevention and monitoring of the state impacts of desalination.",

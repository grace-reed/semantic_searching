The methylation level and the transcriptional activity of two RTs and two genes involved in development and cell differentiation were analyzed in fish liver in addition to the determination of fish contaminants levels and diverse growth and morphometric indices. An up-regulation of RTs associated to lower methylation levels and lower growth indices were observed in highly contaminated fish. Our results suggest that RT activation in fish experiencing stress conditions could have both detrimental and beneficial implications, affecting fish growth but promoting resistance to environmental stressors such as pollutants.",

                "text": "Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences that have the ability to replicate, to move and to integrate elsewhere in the genome. There are two main classes of TEs, (i) retrotransposons (RTs) that transpose via an RNA intermediate and (ii) DNA transposons that transpose directly without RNA intermediate. Three major orders of RTs are distinguished: long terminal repeats (LTR) RTs, long interspersed elements (LINEs) and short interspersed elements (SINEs). These RTs accumulate in the genome via a copy-and-paste mechanism and can constitute a substantial proportion of the genome (Elbarbary et al., 2016) . For example, SINEs and LINEs constitute 30% of the human genome (Lander et al., 2001) . TEs have long been considered as \"selfish\" or \"parasitic\" DNA elements since active TEs are known to be highly mutagenic and to impair the fitness of their host (Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007) . The role of TEs in genome evolution, microevolution and transcription regulation has received increasing attention in recent years (Federoff, 2012; Casacuberta and Gonz alez, 2013; Faulkner et al., 2009; Rey et al., 2016) . RTs are non-randomly distributed in genomes and new insertions of these elements in the genome can provide alternative promoters for genes (Lander et al., 2001; Faulkner et al., 2009) . Moreover, an emerging body of evidence indicates that RTs can directly regulate gene expression at different molecular levels, by acting on the chromatin structure, gene transcription, pre-mRNA processing and mRNA metabolism (Elbarbary et al., 2016) . Thus, TEs can shape the transcriptome of cells via mechanisms acting at both the genomic and transcriptional levels. In addition, although RTs are mostly inactive in their hosts, they are activated during specific stages of development, mainly during early embryogenesis but also later at the adult stage during cell fate and reprogramming or in response to stress (Fedoroff, 2012; Hutchins and Pei, 2015; Hunter et al., 2012; Capy et al., 2000; Mart\u00ednez and Slotkin, 2012) .",

In a previous work, we reported changes in the DNA methylation status of RT-like sequences in the liver of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) experimentally exposed to Cd. These changes were associated with changes in the transcriptional activity of neighboring genes (Pierron et al., 2014a) . In another work carried out on the liver of wild eels collected in sites presenting different levels of pollution, we reported changes in the transcription level of genes involved in cell differentiation, development and epigenetic mechanisms in contaminated eels (Baillon et al., 2016) . Since (i) RTs are known to be activated by abiotic and biotic stress or during cell reprogramming in the somatic tissues of adult animals and (ii) major mechanisms responsible for the regulation of TEs transcription and transposition are DNA methylation and histone methylation (i.e. epigenetic mechanisms (Hutchins and Pei, 2015; Fedoroff, 2012) ), the present work was carried out to test the hypothesis that in situ chronic exposure to pollutants can induce changes in the methylation and/or the activity of RTs in the liver of wild fish.",

                "text": "We measured the DNA methylation and the transcription level of a LINE (UnaL2) and a SINE (UnaSINE) in wild European eels captured in four sampling sites selected on the basis of their known gradient of contamination by metallic and organic pollutants (previous data published in Baillon et al., 2015; Laporte et al., 2016 and Pannetier et al., 2016) . Rather than performing analyses at the genomic level, we analyzed these three elements at the epigenetic and RNA levels. Indeed, if RTs were found to be activated by abiotic stressors mainly during experimental investigations, it remains unknown when TEs are activated or what triggers TE activation in nature (Matsunaga et al., 2015) . Moreover, because of accumulated mutations or truncation, most RTs present in a genome are no longer able to retrotranspose. However, recent works suggest that such non-coding RTderived sequences can modulate cell gene expression (e.g. lncRNAs (Hutchins and Pei, 2015) ) playing a key role in phenotypic plasticity (Rey et al., 2016; Aubin-Horth and Renn, 2009) . In addition, although numerous studies were carried out, notably in fish, to study the genome dynamics and chromosomal localization of RTs, studies investigating the methylation and/or the transcription level of RTs in wild animals remain scarce (Barbosa et al., 2014) . Finally, recent evidences support that TEs and epigenetic components jointly constitute a molecular engine triggering rapid adaptive phenotypic responses to environmental changes. Thus, our study also aimed at testing whether environmental factors (mainly pollutants) can trigger RT activation and whether this activation can have longlasting effects on animals, not in an evolutionary perspective, which has already received a lot of attention (Casacuberta and Gonz alez, 2013; Zeh et al., 2009) but rather at the physiological and individual levels. In order to link potential changes in RT DNA methylation and transcription levels to environmental factors and phenotypic traits, we measured the contamination levels of eels as well as different morphometric and growth indices. Finally, as RTs are known to be activated during cell fate and reprogramming, we measured the transcription level of two genes involved in cell differentiation or in the survival and maintenance of stem/progenitor cells, the arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide repeats protein (Zoltewicz et al., 2003) (rere) and the transcription factor SOX-6 (Baillon et al., 2016; Abdelalim et al., 2014; Ohta et al., 2013) (sox6) . Analyses were carried out in liver samples due to the key role of this organ in energy metabolism and fish growth, as well as in xenobiotic and metallic detoxification (Fuentes et al., 2013) . The gene rere was previously found to be up-regulated in wild contaminated eels (Baillon et al., 2016) . Moreover, in this previous paper, we hypothesized that cellular differentiation and stem/progenitor liver cells could be involved in the adaptive response developed by eels chronically exposed to pollutant mixtures. Cellular differentiation induces significant changes in the phenotype of cells, from their shape to their metabolic activity and their responsiveness to external and internal stimuli (Miyajima et al., 2014) . The gene sox6 was also analyzed as sox gene family members are representative of stemness-related genes (Ohta et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2015) .",

Means sharing same-case letters do not differ significantly (P > 0.05). Certes salt marshes (considered as a reference site; CER; 44 41 0 18 00 N; 1 1 0 39 00 W), the Gironde estuary (GIR; 45 12 0 07 00 N; 0 43 0 35 00 W), the Garonne river (GAR; 44 43 0 51 00 N; 0 28 0 05 00 W) and the Dordogne river (DOR, 44 0 05 00 N; 0 08 0 25 00 W). These four sites are located within a distance of 37 km (Fig. 1 ). Fish were collected during ten consecutive days, May 22 to 31 of 2012, using a trawl or a fyke net. For each sampling site, a total of eight immature yellow eels were collected and used for subsequent analyses. Fish were dissected as soon as possible at the proximity of the sampling site and organs (liver and muscle) were divided into several samples. Samples for DNA methylation and transcription analyses were stored in RNA later at \u00c020 C until needed. For both organic and metal analyses, samples were stored at \u00c080 C. For all sites, temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentrations were determined using a multi-parameter portable device at 1 m under the surface and by using data coming from the automated observation network of the Gironde (MAGEST network).",

Indeed the annual growth rate in length in eels decreases gradually with age, i.e. growth in length being maximal and linear during their early life (details in Patey et al., 2018) .

All these sequences were compared and aligned to the genome of A. Anguilla (Henkel et al., 2012 ) (genome assembly containing 923 Mbp of scaffolds with a length-weighed median fragment length (N50) of 78 Kbp and 179 Mbp of contigs, which are very small or highly repetitive) using Blast algorithm (Evalue threshold 10 \u00c010 ) and BioEdit software. Among the numerous copies of each RT sequence in the A. anguilla genome, we then searched for the most conserved regions. Finally, these highly conserved regions were used to create a consensus sequence and design specific primers in different parts of the RTs (Fig. S1 ) by means of the Pri-mer3plus software for quantitative RT PCR analysis and using the Pyromark assay design software for pyrosequencing analysis (Table S1 ). Concerning quantitative RT PCR analysis, for UnaL2, specific primers were designed in the 5 0 UTR (containing an internal promoter), 3 0 UTR (containing a stem-loop region required for retrotransposition) and in the unique ORF (containing an endonuclease and a reverse transcriptase) (Kajikawa et al., 2005) . For UnaSINE, specific primers were designed in the region a (containing internal promoter region) and in the region c (a region that corresponds to the stem-loop region of UnaL2). For the other genes investigated (b-actin, rere and sox6), sequences were obtained from two A. anguilla transcriptomic databases; ZF-Genomics (Henkel et al., 2012) and from our previous investigations (Baillon et al., 2015 (Baillon et al., , 2016 . Primers were designed using the Primer3plus software (Table S1 ). Concerning pyrosequencing analyses, specific primers (Table S1 ) were designed to amplify a short fragment located in the upstream part of the 5 0 UTR Region of UnaL2 and in the Region an of UnaSINE.",

Following centrifugation, DNA and RNA were extracted from the homogenate using the AllPrep DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen) according to manufactures' guidelines. DNA concentrations as well as purity were determined by spectrophotometry (Take3, Epoch, Biotek). Quantification of single cytosine percent methylation at specific sites in the UnaL2 and UnaSINE RTs was then performed using the bisulfite-pyrosequencing method. First, 500 ng of DNA were bisulfite converted using the MethylEdge Bisulfite Conversion System (Promega) according to manufactures' guidelines. Then, 15 ng of bisulfite converted DNA was amplified by PCR using the PyroMark PCR kit (Qiagen) according to manufactures' instructions. Cycling conditions were as follows: 10-min initial denaturation step at 95 C, followed by 45 cycles of 94 C for 30 s, 30 s at optimal annealing temperature of primers (56 C for UnaL2 and 59 C for UnaSINE), 30 s at 72 C, 10 min of final elongation at 72 C. Pyrosequencing of biotinylated PCR products was performed by means of the PyroMark Q48 Autoprep (Qiagen) and specific pyrosequencing primers (Table S1 ). Average DNA methylation levels of CpN sites were quantified using the PyroMark Q48 autoprep software (Qiagen). For UnaL2, three CpG sites were analyzed. For UnaSINE, two CpG sites and one CpA site were analyzed. In addition, for each RT, in order to assay the conversion efficiency of the bisulfite treatment the average methylation level of one CpT site was measured. Indeed, while the preferential site of non-CpG methylation is CpA (especially in the case of RTs), CpT and CpC sites are mostly not methylated (Ichiyanagi et al., 2013) . For both RTs, the average methylation level of this control site was lower than 5% (i.e. corresponding to the detection limit), indicating a good conversion efficiency. Examples of pyrograms are available in Fig. S2 .",

Each 20 mL reaction contained 12.5 mL of GoTaq qPCR master mix (Promega), 5 mL template and the specific primer pairs at a final concentration of nM each. The reaction specificity was determined for each reaction by gel electrophoresis and from the dissociation curve of the PCR product. This was obtained by following the SyberGreen fluorescence level during a gradual heating of the PCR products from 60 to 95 C. Amplification efficiencies for all primer sets were calculated; all values proved to be sufficient to allow direct comparison of amplification plots according to the DDCt method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) . Relative quantification of gene expression was achieved by concurrent amplification of the b-actin endogenous control. Hence, during our experiment, total RNAs were quantified and 1 mg was used to be reverse-transcribed. During the subsequent qPCR amplifications, the output cycle corresponding to the b-actin was examined. No significant difference was observed on the output cycle of b-actin among fish from the four sampling sites (p > 0.05), demonstrating the relevance of the b-actin as reference gene in our conditions.",

Then, comparisons among fish groups from different classes were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), after checking assumptions of normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and homoscedasticity of the error terms (Levene). When the assumptions were not met as deduced from ad-hoc tests, we used box-cox data transformations or the nonparametric Kruskal\u00c0Wallis test.

For example, Alu elements (i.e. a SINE) are present in 5.7% of human mRNA 3 0 UTR (Faulkner et al., 2009) . The transcription levels of the different PCR products of UnaSINE or UnaL2 were highly correlated among themselves. For UnaSINE, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (r) between UnaSINE_a, UnaSINE_c and UnaSINE_ac varied from 0.947 to 0.964 (p < 0.05). For UnaL2, r varied from 0.941 to 0.976 (p < 0.05, see Table S2 ). This reinforces the fact that the changes observed among sites are mainly associated to RT activation rather than to only changes in RT fragments associated to coding mRNA. In addition, the transcription levels of UnaSINE and UnaL2 were highly correlated among themselves (r varied from 0.848 to 0.953, p < 0.05). This appears consistent with the fact that UnaSINE is mobilized by UnaL2 as demonstrated by Kajikawa et al. (2005) in HeLa cells.",

Concerning protein-coding mRNA, i.e. rere and sox6 transcripts, the transcription level of rere was significantly higher in fish from DOR in comparison to fish from CER and GIR. For sox6, fish from DOR presented significantly higher values than fish from the other sites ( Fig. 2E ). It is difficult to determine what kind of stress or environmental factors or even intrinsic factors triggered changes in RT transcription levels among sites. Indeed, the four sampling sites presented different profiles of metal and organic pollution (see Baillon et al., 2015; Laporte et al., 2016 and Pannetier et al., 2016) as well as different salinities and temperatures (Table 1 ). In addition, intrinsic parameters such as age are known to trigger changes in RT transcription levels, the expression level of RTs increasing with ageing in mammalian somatic tissues (De Cecco et al., 2013) . In our case, fish from GAR were significantly older than fish from CER or DOR (Table 1) .",

                "text": "In order to link the observed changes to phenotypic traits, we first realized a principal component analysis (PCA; Fig. S3 ) using the DNA methylation and transcription levels of RTs and the variables described in Table 2 . Principal component 1 (PC1) was mainly defined by organic pollutant concentrations, growth indices and the transcription level of RTs. Thus, the PCA analysis highlighted the importance of these three groups of variables as well as a relationship among them. Among RTs, UnaL2_5 0 UTR was found to have the most important contribution to the PC1 (Table S3 ) as well as the most significant correlations not only with all growth indices but also with the concentrations of some pollutants in eels. The most significant correlation between UnaL2 transcription levels and growth indices was found between UnaL2_5 0 UTR transcript and back-calculated length at 3 years (r \u00bc \u00c00.565, p < 0.001; Table S2 ). Among pollutants, the most significant correlations were observed with the concentration of PCB153 (r \u00bc 0.529, p \u00bc 0.002) and 4.4 0 DDE (i.e. a metabolite of DDT, r \u00bc 0.514, p \u00bc 0.006). UnaL2_5-0 UTR was also correlated with the transcription level of rere and sox6 (r \u00bc 0.617 and 0.563; p < 0.001 and p \u00bc 0.001, respectively). We must add that the contribution of the methylation levels of both UnaL2 and UnaSINE to the PCA was very limited (Table S3) . Moreover, no significant correlations were observed between RT DNA methylation levels and their corresponding transcription levels (Table S2 ). This appears consistent with the fact that RTs can be activated by stress either directly or through the arousal of their epigenetic control (Rey et al., 2016) but also with the mode of action of epigenetic marks. Covalent addition of a methyl group to cytosine influences the condensation level of chromatin and the accessibility of transcription factors to their binding sites, modulating the plasticity and/or the reaction norm of a gene (Aubin-Horth and Renn, 2009; Dixon et al., 2014) . Thus, a correlation analysis is probably not the most appropriate method to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation, transcription and phenotypic traits.",

                "text": "In order to deepen the relationships between RT DNA methylation levels, RT transcription levels, phenotypic traits and environmental factors, we also created 3-class typology of animals according to their transcription levels of UnaL2_5 0 UTR. A significant up-regulation of UnaSINE and UnaL2 was observed along the three classes (Table 2) . No difference in age was observed among the three classes. The upregulation of RTs in fish from the low to the high class was nevertheless associated with (i) a significant decrease in the DNA methylation levels of UnaL2_CG2, (ii) a significant increase in OCP and especially 4,4 0 DDE concentrations, (iii) a significant decrease of all growth indices and (iv) a significant up-regulation of both rere and sox6 transcripts. Taken together, our results show that fish with high transcription levels of RTs presented low DNA methylation levels of UnaL2, low growth indices and high contamination levels. The distribution of fish among these classes according to their site of origin is presented in Fig. 3 . The low class was constituted by fish from CER, GIR and GAR. The intermediate class was constituted by fish of all sampling sites while the high class was equally constituted by fish from DOR and GAR. Thus, the high class was the only class that was exclusively constituted by fish from freshwater environments. This could explain, at least in part (and if we consider that eels are mostly resident; further discussed below), why fish from the high class presented significantly lower growth indices than fish from the low class. Indeed, eels grow faster in brackish than in freshwater, even under experimental conditions (Cairns et al., 2009; C\u00f4t e et al., 2009; Daverat et al., 2012) . However, salinity alone cannot explain the differences observed in term of RT transcription levels, RT methylation levels or even growth indices among the three classes. For example, while no significant differences were observed in growth indices between fish from the high and the intermediate classes, the intermediate class was constituted by fish from all sampling sites (including 36.4% of fish from freshwater sites and 63.6% fish from brackish water sites). Laporte et al. (2016) recently reported within-generation polygenic selection (RAD-Seq) in response to organic and metal contaminants and more precisely in response to PCB153, 4.4 0 DDE and Se exposure in the same eels. Interestingly, PCB153 and 4.4 0 DDE were the two organic pollutants that were the most correlated with the transcription level of UnaL2_5 0 UTR and 4.4 0 DDE was the only pollutant for which significant differences in bioaccumulation levels were observed among the different UnaL2 classes. In other words, among the three contaminants that were previously pointed out to be major selective agents in our sampling sites, two were also associated with the highest RT transcription levels. This observation supports that RT activation is associated to pollution and toxic conditions (Roling et al., 2004) .",

                "text": "There is increasing experimental evidence that some TEs exhibit abiotic and biotic stress-responsive transcription or movement especially in plants (Capy et al., 2000; Wessler, 1996 ; Makarevitch et al., 2015; Lish, 2009) and to a lesser extent in fungi, corals, insects, crustaceans, fish and mammals (Barbosa et al., 2014; Zeh et al., 2009; Roling et al., 2004) . Moreover, it is now recognized that environmental factors, such as nutritional quality or exposure to pollutants, can strongly affect the epigenetic status of cells (Vandegehuchte and Janssen, 2011; Pierron et al., 2014b; Feil and Fraga, 2012) and notably the methylation state of RTs (Pierron et al., 2014a; Jirtle and Skinner, 2007; Dolinoy, 2008) . DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark commonly associated with transcriptional repression and that can be conserved during cell division. Moreover, stress-induced changes in RT DNA methylation levels can have long-lasting effects on the phenotype of organisms by affecting the transcription of adjacent genes and this, even after the environmental cue that induced these changes is removed (Aubin-Horth and Renn, 2009; Dolinoy, 2008) . In the present study, we found that the transcription levels of RTs were positively correlated with the contamination levels of eels. We also found that the up-regulation of RTs among UnaL2_5 0 UTR classes was associated with lower DNA methylation levels of UnaL2. The upregulation of RT transcription levels and the decrease in RT DNA methylation levels were further associated with (i) lower growth indices and (ii) an up-regulation of two genes involved in development and cell fate, i.e. rere (Wang et al., 2008) and sox6 (Cantu' et al., 2011) . Rere encodes a protein that acts as transcriptional co-repressor during embryonic development (Zeh et al., 2009) . Sox6 has been suggested to act both as activator or repressor (Cantu' et al., 2011) . Sox6 by recruiting ctbp2 (C-terminal binding protein 2), a gene that we previously found to be up-regulated in wild contaminated eels collected in the same sampling sites (Baillon et al., 2015) , is known to repress transcription of the fibroblast growth factor 3 (fgf-3). Taken together, our findings appear consistent with the fact that TE activation in response to stress (i) is associated to changes in their methylation status and (ii) is known to decrease the host fitness (Casacuberta and Gonz alez, 2013) . On another side, given the recent findings that highlighted the key influence of TEs as regulators of gene expression (Elbarbary et al., 2016; Faulkner et al., 2009) , it is intriguing to speculate that TE activation not only triggers detrimental effects but also plays a role in the responsive capacity of their hosts in face of environmental challenges (Casacuberta and Gonz alez, 2013) . A consequence of new TE insertions is the creation of new genetic innovation that can lead to an increased resistance to xenobiotics (Casacuberta and Gonz alez, 2013; Zeh et al., 2009; Schlenke and Begun, 2004; Aminetzachet al., 2005) . Concerning the contribution of RT RNAs in the \"direct\" physiological response to stress, the question has received less attention. Even so, an emerging body of evidence indicates that RNAs of both SINEs and LINEs can regulate gene expression at different levels (Elbarbary et al., 2016) . For example, SINEs (Alu RNAs) were found to act as transacting transcriptional repressor (i.e. inhibiting mRNA transcription of specific mRNA genes) during the cellular heat shock response in human cells and mouse (Mariner et al., 2008) . More stirring, a few recent cutting-edge studies have shown how RTs shape specific stem cell gene expression (Robbez-Masson and Rowe, 2015; Ohnuki et al., 2014) . In vitro studies have shown that TEs are up-regulated during the reprogramming of human primary hepatocytes (Friedli et al., 2014) . During reprogramming, differentiated somatic cells (mature hepatocytes) turn into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Moreover, recent findings have reported a crucial role of Alu elements in association with sox genes in cancer drug resistance. These resistant cancer cell lines shared some common features with iPSCs (Lin et al., 2015) . Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) play a major role in liver repair and regeneration and are known to be highly resistant to xenobiotics (Ros et al., 2003) . In this view, we must add that sox gene family members are representative of stemness-related genes, promoting cell survival and maintenance of stem/progenitor cells (Ohta et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2015) . Another argument supporting an important functional role of these RTs relies on the conservation of the UnaL2 and UnaSINE sequences. Indeed, although radiation and speciation of A. anguilla and A. japonica is estimated at about 30 million years ago (Aoyama, 2009) , the sequence of UnaL2 and UnaSINE were found to be highly conserved between the two species (Figs. S4 and S5) . In addition, we found that the genes located at the proximity of UnaL2 or UnaSINE at the genomic level (Figs. S6 and S7) were at the same time involved in anatomical structure development (GO term 0048856) or regulation of biological quality (GO term 0065008) but also in response to stress (GO term 0006950) or response to chemical stimulus (GO term 0042221). Finally, it was recently proposed that the interplay between TEs and epigenetic components constitute an integrative molecular engine that allows organisms to fine-tune phenotypes in a real-time fashion (Rey et al., 2016) , playing a key role in the rapid adaptive phenotypic responses to stress. In this view, significant differences in the interindividual variability of UnaL2 methylation levels were observed both among sampling sites and Unal2_5 0 UTR classes ( Fig. 2A and Table 2 ). In both analyses, the least contaminated fish (i.e. eels from CER or from the low class) presented the highest inter-individual variabilities. For example, a significant and gradual decrease in the variance of the DNA methylation levels of UnaL2_CG2 was observed in fish from the low to the high class (Fig. 4A ). This could be explained by different life history traits. Indeed, although yellow (i.e. somatic growth phase) eels are considered to be mostly residents, previous investigations showed that a fraction of eels inhabiting brackish waters can move between coastal/estuarine and freshwater systems once or more during their growth phase (mainly at early life, until the age of 2e3 years). However, previous investigations carried out on eels from the Arcachon Bay found that eels from CER are residents (Daverat and Tom as, 2006) . We must note that A. anguilla is a panmictic species with random dispersal of larvae. European eels reproduce once in their life in the Sargasso Sea, from where larvae drift back toward the European coasts following oceanic currents. When larvae reach the continental slope, they metamorphose into young eels that penetrate continental habitats and complete their growth phase in a large range of systems (lagoons, estuaries, marshes, rivers, lakes and streams).",

The loss of variability from fish of the low class to fish of the high class could be thus viewed as a result of an intensive environmental constraint. This appears consistent with our observation that RT up-regulation was associated with two pollutants (PCB153 and 4.4 0 DDE) that we previously identified as the major selective agents in eels from these sites, supporting a role of RTs in increasing fish survival (Laporte et al., 2016) . This loss of variability at the epigenetic level was instead associated with an increased variability in UnaL2 transcription levels (Fig. 4B) . Such an effect is consistent with the general hypothesis for which weak DNA methylation levels facilitate environmentally responsive expression (Dixon et al., 2014) . Low methylation levels can increase transcription plasticity by allowing greater access of transcription factors to binding sites. Through this mechanism, DNA methylation could allow the emergence of variable transcriptomic phenotypes that are required for rapid acclimation in selective environments and, potentially, adaption in the case of new RT insertions. This is also consistent with the fact that whereas no significant difference in mean UnaL2_CG2 methylation levels was observed between fish from the intermediate and high class, both the variance and mean of UnaL2 transcription levels were significantly higher in fish from the high class in comparison to fish from the intermediate class.",

In addition, fish from the high class, in comparison to fish from the intermediate class, only come from freshwater sites. Several authors qualified the migration of eels into freshwaters as paradoxical, given the fitness penalty imposed by relatively slow growth in freshwaters and the fact that this migration is facultative to complete their particular life cycle (Cairns et al., 2009; Daverat and Tom as, 2006; Edeline, 2007) . Freshwater appear to be an unfavorable or, at least, not optimal condition for European eel growth. Thus, high and highly variable UnaL2 transcription levels were associated to the worst environmental conditions for eels; i.e. high contamination levels associated to low salinity in our case study.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation from different sources in the diet of dairy sheep under high ambient temperatures on ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation and inflammatory responses. The experiment was carried out during summer: 32 Comisana ewes were divided into 4 groups of 8. The FS group was supplemented with whole flaxseed, the AG group was supplemented with Ascophyllum nodosum, the FS+AG group was supplemented with a combination of flaxseed and A. nodosum. The fourth group (CON group) was a control and received a diet containing no supplement. The average maximum temperature was around 33\u00b0C during wk 2 and 3, whereas the mean temperature never decreased below 26\u00b0C. Following 15 d of treatment with respective diets, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from sheep who received a diet supplemented with A. nodosum had impaired cell proliferation responses and IL-6 production after mitogen stimulation compared with PBMC from FS+AG sheep. In addition, PBMC from AG sheep displayed impaired cell proliferation compared with cells from the CON group. The FS+AG cells produced lower levels of IL-10 than CON cells, and higher IL-6 than AG and CON cells. Results demonstrated that the supplementation with PUFA from different sources in a sheep's diet can influence their immunological responses under high ambient temperatures depending on the composition of fatty acid supplementation. In particular, synergistic effects of different PUFA from flaxseed and A. nodosum, simultaneously administrated in the sheep diet, were observed on activation of inflammation response.",

Stress can affect the immune system by altering immunological and inflammatory processes. In sheep, both physiological stress connected to gestation and lambing, and psychological stress, caused by isolation, increased in vivo plasma secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 (Caroprese et al., 2006 . During an immunological challenge the balance between pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines is an important mechanism to regulate the ongoing pro-inflammatory processes and to avoid tissue damage resulting from excessive inflammation. Interleukin-10 is a well-known anti-inflammatory cytokine whose main role is to reduce the production of inflammatory mediators after immunological challenges (Murray, 2006) . During the summer season in the Mediterranean basin, dairy animals are exposed to climatic conditions that often result in a depression of the immune system (Lacetera et al., 2005) .",

During incubation at 55\u00b0C for 1 h and 30 min, the tubes were inverted to mix for 5 s every 20 min. After cooling in a cold water bath, 3 mL of hexane were added into each tube and vortex for 5 min. The tubes were centrifuged at room temperature for 5 min at 500 g; supernatant (1 mL) was taken from each tube and transferred into vials and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until GC analysis. Fatty acid profile was quantified using 6890N GC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), equipped with a flame ionization detector. Helium was the carrier gas and the gas flow rate was 175 kPa. The oven temperature was initially held at 70\u00b0C for 4 min, and then programmed to 175\u00b0C at 13\u00b0C/min increase and held isothermally for 45 min.

After washing with PBS (pH 7.2) and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the plates were incubated with 200 \u03bcL/well of 10% reconstituted commercial bovine skim milk at 37\u00b0C for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. Plates were then washed 4 times with PBST and the supernatants (100 \u03bcL per well) were added and incubated for 1 h. The PBST provided negative control wells. Plates were then washed 4 times with PBST. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ovine IL-6 antibody (Serotec Ltd., UK), were used as detecting antibodies (0.005 mg/mL diluted in 1% BSA in PBST) to determine captured IL-6 and were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The presence of bindings for IL-6 was detected using sheep anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Sigma Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Optical density was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm. Culture supernatants were read against a standard curve obtained using scalar dilution of recombinant ovine IL-6 (Kingfisher Biotech Inc., St Paul, MN). Data were expressed as nanograms per milliliter of IL-6. Interferon-\u03b3 and IL-10 in plasma were assayed by an ELISA test as briefly described in the following: 96-well plates (Sterilin, Newport, UK) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 100 \u03bcL of anti-bovine IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 mAb (Clone CC330 for IFN-\u03b3 and Clone CC318 for IL-10, Serotec) in PBS (2 \u03bcg/mL). After washing with PBST, the antibody was blocked with PBS/1% BSA for 1 h. The IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 standard and samples were added to plate for 1 h at room temperature after washing 4 times. Biotinylated secondary anti-bovine IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 mAb (Clone CC302 for IFN-\u03b3 and Clone CC320 for IL-10, Serotec) in PBS (0.5 \u03bcg/mL) were added for 1 h followed by 100 \u03bcL of streptavidin-HRP (2 \u03bcg/mL in PBS, Serotec). After washing, 100 \u03bcL of 3,3c,5,5c-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution was added to each well for 30 min; to stop the reaction, 50 \u03bcL of H 2 SO 4 (4 M) was added to each well. The levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 were measured colorimetrically at 450 nm (by subtracting absorbance at 540 nm) and quantified by interpolation from standard curve.

However, a direct effect of A. nodosum dietary supplementation on PBMC proliferation in sheep was not investigated. In a previous study, extracts from a microalgae, Dunaliella tertiolecta, showed a suppressive effect on sheep PBMC proliferation in vitro (Caroprese et al., 2012) . In addition, in the current experiment, a suppressive effect on PBMC collected from sheep supplemented with A. nodosum was observed. Previous studies reported that EPA can reduce proliferation in cell cultures (Calder, 2002) . As a result, we could attribute the observed reduction in PBMC proliferation to the high EPA content of A. nodosum. The influence of n-3 PUFA dietary supplementation on the immune system of livestock could be related to the alteration of absorption of other nutrients relevant to the immune status, or to a direct effect of n-3 PUFA on the immune system (Wistuba et al., 2005) . However, in a previous study on cows, ALA had no effects on lymphocyte proliferation in vitro (Thanasak et al., 2005) . The supplementation of sheep under heat stress with whole flaxseed, rich in ALA, did not result in an enhancement of cell-mediated immune responses (Caroprese et al., 2012) . Accordingly, ex vivo stimulation of PBMC proliferation in the present experiment was not affected by flaxseed supplementation in the sheep diet. In vitro and animal feeding studies, it was found that sufficient amounts of ALA can partially inhibit lymphocyte proliferation (Calder, 2002) . When sheep were fed the combination of PUFA from A. nodosum and flaxseed, their lymphocyte proliferation increased compared with proliferation of PBMC from sheep fed A. nodosum alone. This result could be ascribed to the simultaneous action exerted on the immune system by PUFA from algae and flaxseed, namely EPA and ALA, supplemented in the diet of sheep. It has been stated in several animal and human studies that n-3 fatty acids have different immunomodulatory activities, and among them, EPA is more biologically potent than ALA (Calder et al., 2002) .",

In cows fed flaxseed under heat stress, Caroprese et al. (2009) showed a decrease of IL-10 production in vivo, which supported immune responses during heat stress leading to the activation of cell-mediated immunity. Our present results, accordingly, showed a decrease of IL-10 production by PBMC from sheep fed FS+AG and activated with PHA compared with IL-10 production in PBMC from CON sheep. The absence of decreased IL-10 production by PBMC from FS sheep compared with PBMC from CON sheep could be attributed to the increase in cortisol secretion observed in FS sheep (Caroprese et al., 2014) . It is well known that glucocorticoids have a direct effect on IL-10 production because they are able to upregulate the IL-10 secretion by T cells (Elenkov and Chrousos, 1999) . Data on the decrease of the production of IL-10 in sheep fed with PUFA from flaxseed and A. nodosum demonstrated the possible synergistic positive effect of the EPA, from A. nodosum, and ALA, from flaxseed, to limit the production of an anti-inflammatory mediator. The reduced release of IL-10, which is an important anti-inflammatory cytokine, promoted an ex vivo pro-inflammatory profile in FS+AG sheep.",

In our experiment, a synergistic reinforcing interaction between PUFA from flaxseed and A. nodosum was observed in the increase of IL-6 secretion by PBMC from FS+AG sheep compared with CON and AG sheep. The increase of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines after acute physiological stress is useful to predict the ongoing of stress, both in animals and humans (Black, 2002) . Indeed, in multiple lambing, sheep with high levels of IL-6 in vivo were found, this being a result of the activation of the immune system to cope with the physiological stress connected to multiple pregnancy (Caroprese et al., 2006) . The interaction between stress and inflammation is a well-known biological mechanism that offers an animal engaged in a stressful situation, a survival advantage because an inflammatory response would help deal with any infectious organisms introduced during acting stress (Black, 2002) . The increase in IL-6 production by PBMC from FS+AG sheep can also be related to the concomitant reduction of IL-10 secretion by PBMC from FS+AG. The PBMC from sheep under high ambient temperatures and supplemented with PUFA from flaxseed and flaxseed in a combination of A. nodosum, showed a reduction in the IL-6 levels, when activated by PHA. In human PBMC activated by mitogens, the dietary inclusion of PUFA from flaxseed and fish oil caused a reduction of in vitro secretion of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (Kelley, 2001) . Several studies (Kelley et al., 1993 , Caughey et al., 1996 reported that large amounts of ALA intake inhibited in vivo and ex vivo indices of immune response. The increase in IL-6 production by PBMC from FS+AG could be of some importance when considering that IL-6 is implicated in the development of acute septic shock following coliform mastitis, and can be considered the proinflammatory cytokine mainly evocated in Escherichia coli mastitis (Shuster et al., 1993; Riollet, 2000) . Based on the influence exerted by the addition of flaxseed in combination with A. nodosum in the diet on sheep IL-6 production, it may be argued that the diet influenced innate immunity ex vivo. In contrast, the absence of results from the different diets on IFN-\u03b3 production suggested that diets failed in affecting the transition from innate immunity to adaptive immunity, which is coordinated by IFN-\u03b3, at least up to 15 d.",

The combined supplementation of PUFA from flaxseed and A. nodosum, based on the presence of both ALA and EPA, showed a pro-inflammatory response as demonstrated by the increase in IL-6 and the decrease in IL-10 productions. Results of the experiment demonstrated that the supplementation with PUFA from different sources in sheep can influence their immunological responses under high ambient temperatures in relation to the composition of fatty acid supplementation. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of PUFA from different sources on sheep cytokine profile under different types of stressors.",

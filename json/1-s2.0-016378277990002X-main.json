This interest has been stimulated by such factors as the search for new protein sources and drugs, recognition of the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acids in human health and nutrition, concern for contamination of sea foods by pesticides and chlorinated hydrocarbons and certainly by the development of modern, analytic technology. Reviews by Lovern s6 in 1964 and Malins and Wekell a7 in 1970, both of which indicated large untapped areas of knowledge in this discipline, have also probably played a role in enhancing research efforts in this field.",

There is, however, no basic difference in the two systems, as both are based upon the position of the terminal olefinic bond with reference to the nonpolar end of the molecule, i.e. the end carbon chain. Either system is very convenient in discussions of fatty acid biosynthesis by chain-elongation and desaturation since, in this process, the end carbon chain is unaltered and fatty acid family relationships are clarified. These systems also form the basis for semi-log plotting techniques and calculations widely used in the identification of fatty acids separated by GLC. 3-5'55 For nonmethylene-interrupted polyunsaturates, this system cannot be used and the positions of the double bonds within the molecule must be specified. In this review, fatty acids of this type are identified by the number of carbons in the chain followed by the number of double bonds, the symbol A, and the positions of the double bonds relative to the carboxyl group of the molecule.",

Almost all sponges are sessile and may be found wherever a suitable stratum for attachment is present. Their physiology is entirely dependent upon the circulation of water through numerous body chambers, canals and pores which they are able to control, to some degree. Sponges are filter-feeders and 80% of the available organic matter which they consume is sub-microscopic in size, the remaining 20% consisting of smaller plankton such as dinoflagellates and bacteria. 17 It is possible that dissolved organics may be very important in the nutrition of these animals.",

The concentration of activity in the first five carbons suggests that tagged 20:0 and/or 22:0 were also elongated to 26:0 prior to desaturation, supporting the pathway proposed earlier (Fig. 2 ). This concentration of activity in the first five carbons was also seen in 26:3A5,9,19 with the same implication. The unexpected high activity of the A9,19 fragment may indicate inclusion of 14:0 or shorter precursors in the elongation process or, possibly, the existence of a minor alternative pathway. 98 In a recent study of Xestosponoia halichondroides fatty acids, Litchfield and Marcantonio described the isolation and identification of 28:3A5,9,19, not previously reported as a lipid component of living organisms. \u00b0'* They proposed a biosynthetic pathway originating with oleic acid, i.e. These studies by Litchfield and co-workers have clearly demonstrated that fatty acid chain-elongation in M. prblifera is limited to saturates and unsaturates with a relatively low degree of unsaturation, not only ifi the case of the demospongic acids, but also in that of the more common methylene-interrupted acids ( Table 2) . The monoenoic acids, 16:1 (n-7)and 18:1 (n-9), which are probably both endogenous and exogenous and the exogenous acids, 18:2 (n-6) and 18:3 (n-3), were readily elongated to longchained successor acids, but there was no evidence of elongation of 22:4 (n-6), 22:5 (n-6) or 22: 6 (n-3). This may prove to be characteristic of the Porifera, but it is premature to make that assumption at this time. In recent years, it has become evident that plasmalogens arc not novel compounds, but rather that they are quite widely distributed in marine invertebrates) 4",

Normal fatty acid residues were not observed. The long-chained bases were shown to be saturated C~, Cle and C19 trihydroxy bases (1, 3, 4-trihydroxy-2-aminoalkanes). The hydroxy fatty acids were found to be a homologous series of saturated C2~-C,~ odd and even carbon fatty acids and included a trace amount of ~-hydroxy iso 25:0. On the basis of the degradative studies, the structure shown below (X) was proposed. Cnidarians (or coelenterates) are well known marine organisms to many, even to those who are not coastal residents. Perhaps the most familiar of the hydrozoan cnidarians is the freshwater Hydra sp., commonly studied as a representative of the class in high school and college biology courses. Most of the frequently encountered pelagic medusae (\"jellyfishes\") are scyphozoans although the Portuguese man-of-war, Physalia physal~ is a colony of hy&rozoan individuals. Sea anemones, reef cor0s and sea fans are familiar anthozoan cnidarians.

Mason stated that \"the high incidence of saturated, long-chain fatty acids and the relatively high cholesterol content in the sea anemone, M. senile, would seem to indicate a rigid and highly ordered membrane system in this invertebrate. \"9\u00b0 Actually, the total lipid fatty acid composition of M. senile reported by Mason (Table 10) is quite similar in most respects to that of the hydrozoans (Table 6 ) and scyphozoans (Table 8k particularly with regard to the high levels of (n-6) and (n-3) polyunsaturates. In as much as Mason found that the polar lipids constituted 69.3% of the total lipid in this species, in good agreement with the results of Rouser et al. in their study of A. elegantissima lipids, 11~ the total lipid fatty acid composition should reflect that of the polar iipids, to a considerable extent, but it does not in this particular study. However, since Mason isolated purified lipid classes by repetitive TLC, the low percentages of polyunsaturates and elevated percentages of saturates in both triglyceride and polar lipid classes suggests that considerable autooxidation of polyunsaturates occurred during their isolation. This conclusion is supported by the reported fatty acid composition of M. dianthus (Table 10) 47 as well as by the results of Hill's seasonal study of M. senile 44 and those of an unpublished analysis of Diadumene leucolene fatty acids.14' In this latter investigation, total lipid fatty acids of particular interest included 16:0 (16.5%), 16:1 (2.5%), 18:0 (5.9%), 18:1 (3.1%), 20:4 (n-6) (1.1%)` 20:5 (n-3) (11.6%) and 22:6 (n-3) (25.8%). In addition, Nevenzel has reported that approximately 60% of the fatty acids of M. senile body wall were C2o and C22 polyunsaturates. ~\u00b02 In contrast, however, a recent analysis of P. clematis fatty acids indicated that this anemone contains, primarily, saturated and monoenoic fatty acids which were reported to be: 12:0 (7.5%); 14:0 (8.5%); 14:1 (3.2%); 15:2 (2.8%); 16:0 (23.3%); 16:1 (10.0%); 17:0 (1.0%); 18:0 (7.5%); 18:1 (18.8%); 18.2 (0.2%); 20:1 (6.4%) and 22:2 (9.9%). ~\u00b0~ The authors of this report recognized the presence of wax esters in the lipid extracts, and the fatty acid composition of P. clematis, with its high percentage of 16:0 and 18:1, suggests that wax esters may be present in considerable amounts in this species. While Hill's results are in substantial agreement with those of Hooper and Ackman (Table 10) , there are some obvious differences in the two sets of data. In the former investigation, relatively high percentages of 20:0 (5.5%-7.5%) and 22:1 (7.0%-8.5%) were observed in the total lipids of M. senile in each of the four groups of animals analyzed, but these acids were only very minor components of the individual lipid classes (Table 10 ). 44 The reason for this discrepancy in total and individual lipid class composition is not readily apparent. An even more obvious difference in the two studies is the absence of 20:4 (n-6) from Hill's data. The separation characteristics of the liquid phase utilized in this study (10% SP222-PS; Supelco, Inc;) are quite similar to those of DEGS which generally will not separate 18:3 (n-3) from 20:0 or 20:1, depending upon the percentage of liquid phase .and column temperature, nor 20:4 (n-6) from 22:1, 24 and this seems to be the most reasonable explanation for the differences observed in the two sets of data.",

The preponderance of t 16:1 (n-10) alcohol over the 18:1 isomers and to the exclusion of 16:1 (n-7) led the authors to propose that this structure may be biosynthesized in the alcohol form with subsequent partial conversion to fatty acid. 47 In a study of lipids of an unidentified gorgonian, Hooper and Ackman recovered fatty alcohols after saponification of the total lipids and analyzed them, as acetates, by GLC. 48 Acetates observed were 14:0 (11\u00b0/), 16:0 (32~o), 18:0 (45%) and 18:1 (139,o) but the sample was too small to detect the presence of t 16:1 (n-10).

These results contrasted with those of Bergmann and Landowne who found sphingomyelin but no other common polar lipids in this species. 2\u00b0 Acid hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, followed by identification of aldehydes in the hydrolysates, indicated that these phospholipids were present, to a considerable extent, as plasmalogens in A. elegantissima lipids. ~17 Dembitsky and Vaskovsky have reported that 73.0% of the phosphatidylethanolamine in M. senilefimbriatum lipids contained the alk-l-enyi structure, a4 Quin has isolated AEP, not only from chloroform and aqueous ethanol extracts of M. dianthus and Tealia felina, but also from the insoluble, proteinaceous residue remaining after extraction. ~t4\"11s Aminoethylphosphonic acid was found to comprise 0.99Yo of the dry weight of M. dianthus and 1.8~ of the dry weight of T.felina. ~ ~ ~ The presence of small amounts of phosphorus in oils after prolonged hydrolysis led Quin to suggest that phosphono-compounds were also present in the nonsaponifiable fraction of M. dianthus lipids. 11 s Phosphonic acids other than AEP have been found in Anthopleura xanthogrammica; 2-methylaminoethylphosphonic acid (XIII), 2-dimethylaminoethylphosphonic acid (XIV), and 2-trimethylaminoethylphosphonic acid (XV). 67'68 A potential precursor of AEP, 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (XVI) has been observed in Zoanthus sociatus. 66 Ceramide aminoethylphosphonate has also been isolated from lipids of M. senile. 63\"b:~ Phosphonoethylamine and ceramides were identified following hydrolysis of CAEP with Clostridium perfringens phospholipase. Alkaline hydrolysis of the ceramide fraction yielded fatty acids and two long-chained bases. The fatty acids were found to be predominantly 16:0 (52Yo) but 35Yo branched-chain acids were detected. Employing a variety of modern analytical techniques, Karlsson and Samuelsson showed that the major longchained base was D-erythro-l,3-dihydroxy-2-amino-trans-4,trans-8-octadecadiene and they noted the possibility that the fatty acid, t 16:1 (n-10) may be a direct biosynthetic precursor of this compound. ~4 The major molecular species of ceramide aminoethylpho,phonate of M. senile is shown below (XVII). It has been suggested that phosphonolipils may stabilize membranes which are exposed to hydrolytic enzymes such as phosplolipases and phosphatases.12a Phosphonate phosphorus has generally been determined indirectly as the difference between total phosphorus and that released as orthophosphate after prolonged hydrolysis. The method is based upon the assumptions that all phosphorus compounds, other than phosphonates, are completely converted to orthophosphate and that no phosphonates are cleaved or formed during the procedure. In an investigation of phosphorus compounds of the anemone, Bunadosoma sp., Henderson et al. demonstrated that these assumptions are not always valid. 4a They found, after prolonged acid hydrolysis of the anemone lipids, that phosphoethanolamine was resistant to the hydrolysis, destruction of phosphonate with concomitant production of orthophosphate occurred and the structure of the residual phosphonates was altered. They were able to determine the phosphonate:phosphate ratio in simple, unaltered lipid extracts of the anemone by alp N.M.R. spectroscopy and they stressed the utility of this method in the study of phosphonolipids.",

    "abstract": "The nanosized (\u223c10 nm in 0.01 M PBS and 210 nm in water) star-shaped polymethacrylates with various content of pendant carboxyl groups were characterized via basic physicochemical and biological properties toward their use as drug carriers for intravenous administration. The carboxyl groups in polymer were employed to conjugate fluorescein (FA) or doxorubicin (DOX) via amide bond formation. In case of DOX, the conjugation efficiency was higher (4.0-16.0%) than of FA conjugation (1.5-4.5%) for corresponding copolymers. The solubility of conjugates strongly depended on the type of attached compound, that is free carriers and their FA conjugates were water-soluble, whereas DOX conjugates were insoluble in water. Cytotoxicity tests performed on model fibroblast and epithelial cell lines showed that negatively charged copolymers (ZP ranged from \u221275 to \u221225 mV) were slightly toxic for normal cells (NHDF) and non-toxic for cancer cell lines (HCT-116 and MCF-7/ R). The copolymer dose equal to 125 \u03bcg/mL resulted in cell viability 118% towards NHDF and 90% for HCT116 cells. The internalization of a representative polymer-fluorescein conjugate by HCT-116 and its accumulation in cytoplasm was proven via fluorescence microscopy. MMA/MAA stars showed no adverse effect on HCT-116 cells, hence fluorescein-tagged polymers might be applied as fluorescence probes for in vitro imaging, whereas doxorubicin-tagged polymers might be developed as a new polymeric drug carriers.",

Poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) is well known from its pH-responsiveness, therefore the conformation and solubility of polymeric chains containing MAA units can be triggered by pH of aqueous media. There is a high probability that the various pH conditions in different tissues and cellular compartments influence on the interactions and self-assembly behavior of the pH-sensitive polymeric systems. Thus, besides size, the surface charge is the most important physicochemical factor affecting DDS in terms of their function in the drug delivery. Generally, the charged particles are taken up by cells better than their uncharged counterparts. It was proven that cells ingest positively charged poly(lactic acid) (Honary and Zahir, 2013; Pillai et al., 2015) , chitosan (Yue et al., 2011) and polystyrene (Jiang et al., 2010 (Jiang et al., , 2011 particles in a greater degree than the respective anionic ones. Although positive charge appears to improve the efficacy of drug delivery, a higher cytotoxicity of such nanocarriers has been reported (Capco and Yongsheng, 2014).",

                "text": "The polymeric drug delivery systems (DDS) are often investigated in cooperation with fluorescent organic dyes to monitor the transport pathway by fluorescence microscopy, what can help to improve the effectiveness of delivery (Ding et al., 2014; Wu and Chiu, 2013; Sun et al., 2012) . Most of the organic dyes such as fluoresceins, positively charged rhodamines, and cyanines are not used in vivo because of their relatively quick photobleaching, which can damage cells and cause substantial cytotoxicity (Han and Burgess, 2009) . The same problem concerns fluorescent proteins which additionally suffer from low quantum yield as much as aggregation inside cells causing cellular toxicity (Mauring et al., 2007) . Water-soluble semiconducting polymers have demonstrated high sensitivity as biosensors and chemical sensors (Wu et al., 2010) . Up till now, these polymers are not degradable and usually contain conjugated phenyl units, which provide poor solubility in water and promote potential carcinogenesis or toxicity in the cases of in vivo biomedical applications (Tang et al., 2013; Berezin and Achilefu, 2010) . Recently, the fluorescently labeled carbon nano-onions, obtained by a reaction involving the amide bond formation between fluoresceinamine (FA) and the carboxylic groups on the surface, have been applied for in vitro imaging of HeLa cells, demonstrating high emission properties without significant cytotoxicity (Frasconi et al., 2015) . Non-toxicity for HeLa cells was also indicated by the fluorescent labeled Wells-Dawson type polyoxometalates with Sn-organyl derivatives carrying a carboxyl group conjugated with fluoresceinamine, which appeared as randomly dispersed over the entire cytoplasm, or were aggregated in clusters (Geisberger et al., 2013) . Another example for alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate microcapsules labeled with fluoresceinamine were investigated to show the difference in alginate distribution in the Ca-alginate gel beads (Strand et al., 2003) .",

Despite the fact that star-shaped P(MMA-co-MAA) are weak acids, the accumulation of negative charges on polymethacrylic arms takes place, due to dissociation of eCOOH groups. As the result of the Coulomb interac-tions between negatively charged arms, the conformation of macromolecules is changed providing formation of complex superstructures. Significantly smaller particles with sizes \u223c10 nm were obtained in PBS solution, which osmolality and ion concentration resemble human body fluids. Such behavior is explained by the higher ionic strength of the solutions arising from the presence of salts, which leads to negative charge shielding. These results for the star-shaped P(MMA-co-MAA)s are promising, owing to the fact that particles smaller than 100 nm remain in blood vessels within fenestrae of the endothelial lining, improving permeation and retention effect (EPR) of polymers. Typical size distribution graphs and D h as a function of the number of MAA repeating units per macromolecule (DP MAA ) or one arm (DP MAA,arm ) in both media are shown in Fig. 1b and c.",

Therefore, in the studied star-shaped copolymers, the DP MAA was revealed as an important parameter available for simple tuning of macromolecule properties in aqueous solutions (Fig. 2b) . Additionally, the ZP values of polymeric particles in deionized water were lower than in 0.01 M PBS solutions. For instance, the ZP of SPAc1 in deionized water has reached \u221274 mV at 25.0\u00b0C and \u221265 mV at 36.6\u00b0C, whereas in PBS at both temperatures the ZP values were approximately \u221220 mV. Similar tendency was also observed for the 6-arm copolymers. However, in the case of SPAc4 with the largest number of MAA units, the most evident influence of temperature on ZP in both media (differences of 20 mV in water and 8 mV in PBS) was detected. Generally, it has been known that the increase in temperature leads to the increase in mobility of particles and ZP is directly proportional to the electrophoretic mobility of particles (negative as well as positive values). Hence, electrostatic repulsions between the particles should effectively prevent flocculation giving more stable solution. In the studied copolymers the decrease of ZP was caused probably by the intra-and intermolecular interactions between the macromolecules which have triggered the formation of aggregates with lower velocity of the Brownian motion than single macromolecules.

Simultaneously, the influence of SPAc3 on colon cancer cell line HCT-116 was also investigated. The results showed slight cytotoxicity of SPAc3 and its fluorescent derivative on NHDF cells, even though SPAc3 FA was less toxic (average cell viability \u223c85%) than SPAc3 (average cell viability \u223c80%). In most cases, the obtained data were statistically significant comparing to the control.

                "text": "Since SPAc3 did not adversely affect colon cancer cells in a wide range of concentrations, it is expected that the results of toxicity tests conducted with a polymer bearing the drug in its matrix should be free from the influence of the polymer itself on the cell line. At the same time, low cytotoxicity to normal cells demonstrated by SPAc3 at lower doses, suggests a different way of interaction between normal cells and polymer vs colon cancer cells and polymer. It is possible that the difference comes from the environment surrounding cells. Cancer cells differ from normal cells not only with their structure but also metabolites that are generated and excreted to the medium. One of the products of cancer cell metabolism is lactic acid, which yields reduced pH value (the range of pH is 2-5) and might interact with carboxylic groups along polymeric arms. Fig. 5c presents MTS test results for doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/R) treated with all star-shaped MMA/MAA copolymers. This model of cells was especially interesting in relation to our earlier studies conducted on polymers with pendant amine groups (Miela\u0144czyk et al., 2016) . The statistically significant cytotoxicity was determined in two cases, that is SPAc3 and SPAc4 at the lowest dose of 12.5 \u03bcg/mL. Next, the cell proliferation gradually increased reaching maximum values of 130-170% (at polymer dose equal to 75.0 \u03bcg/mL) and then decreased to 97-135%. According to the literature data for the interactions of chitosan/PMAA and Fe O 4 /chitosan/PMAA nanoparticles solutions (at concentrations between 200 and 2000 \u03bcg/mL) with breast cancer cell lines, i.e. MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231, the cell viability remained in the range of 90-120% (Zarouni et al., 2015) . In contrast to that, PMAA hollow microspheres with Ag or/and Fe 3 O 4 on their surface affected MCF-7 cells with an increase of concentration (1-100 \u03bcg/mL) or in the presence of magnetic field (at concentration equal 5 and 10 \u03bcg/mL) (Chatzipavlidis et al., 2013) . In our previous studies, it has been shown that MCF-7/R line treated with series of copolymers with different amine group contents (31-77 mol%) exhibited the hormeticlike response of cells at polymer concentrations between 12.5-500 \u03bcg/ mL (Miela\u0144czyk et al., 2016) . Although, the results of MTS assay are based on mitochondrial activity, in this case they have been interpreted as a cell proliferation since it has been reported that neither PMAA nor (meth)acrylic acid influence on dehydrogenase enzyme activity (Ferdinandusse et al., 2015) . Nonetheless, the cytotoxicity results obtained via MTS assay are highly encouraging. The lack of cytotoxicity effect of SPAc3 on colon cancer cell line was confirmed by apoptosis assay. The results shown in Fig. 6 suggest that either polymer nor polymer-fluorescein conjugate had a negative impact on HCT-116. Although, after 24 h there was a small increase in an apoptotic cells population level in comparison to 1 h ( Fig. 6a and  b) .",

The results indicate that the amount of attached DOX increases with the number of the arms as well as the content of acidic units ( Table 2 ).

The singlet peak assigned to the protons of methyl group in the amino sugar units (eCH 3 , 1.24 ppm) was partially overlapped with the signals of eCH 3 groups in the backbone of polymethacrylate arms.

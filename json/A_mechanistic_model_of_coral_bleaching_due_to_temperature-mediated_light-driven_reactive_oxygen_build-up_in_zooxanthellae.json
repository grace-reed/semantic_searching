    "abstract": "Mass coral bleaching has emerged in the 21st century as the greatest threat to the health of the world's reefs. A sophisticated process understanding of bleaching at the polyp scale has now been achieved through laboratory and field studies, but this knowledge is yet to be applied in mechanistic models of shelf-scale reef systems. In this study we develop a mechanistic model of the coral-symbiont relationship that considers temperature-mediated build-up of reactive oxygen species due to excess light, leading to zooxanthellae expulsion. The model explicitly represents the coral host biomass, as well as zooxanthellae biomass, intracellular pigment concentration, nutrient status, and the state of reaction centres and the xanthophyll cycle. Photophysiological processes represented include photoadaptation, xanthophyll cycle dynamics, and reaction centre state transitions. The mechanistic model of the coral-symbiont relationship is incorporated into a \u223c1 km resolution coupled hydrodynamicbiogeochemical model that encompasses the entire \u223c2000 km length of the Great Barrier Reef. A simulation of the 2016 bleaching event shows the model is able to capture the broadscale features of the observed bleaching, but fails to capture bleaching on offshore reefs due to the model's grid being unable to resolve the bathymetry of shallow platforms surrounded by deep water. To further analyse the model behaviour, a \u223c200 m resolution nested simulation of Davies Reef (18\u00b049\u2032 S, 147\u00b038\u2032 E) is undertaken. We use this nested model to demonstrate the depth gradient in zooxanthellae response to thermal stress. Finally, we discuss the uncertainties in the bleaching model, which lie primarily in quantifying the link between reactive oxygen buildup and the expulsion process. Through the mechanistic representation of environmental forcing, this model of coral bleaching applied in realistic environmental conditions has the potential to generate more detailed predictions than the presently-available satellite-based coral bleaching metrics, and can be used to evaluate proposed management strategies.",

                "text": "Coral bleaching is the expulsion of the unicellular zooxanthellae symbionts from the coral host, often leading to mortality. The link between a warming surface ocean and mass bleaching events had became obvious after the 1998 global event. It was possible in 1999 to predict from climate model simulations that the thermal tolerances of reef-building corals were likely to be exceeded every year within a few decades, and that events as severe as the 1998 event would likely become commonplace within 20 years (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999) . This 1999 prediction of an unprecedented future has eventuated in the late 2010s (Hughes et al., 2017) . Thus the broadscale patterns of mass bleaching are predictable on decadal scales. New management strategies under consideration for coral reef protection include prioritising those individual reefs that are more resilient to future threats (Hock et al., 2017) . Thus it is urgent that we are able to identify reefs with lower thermal stress, or other environmental conditions such as good water clarity, that lead to greater resilience. Furthermore, active intervention strategies are being considered that include the introduction of temperature-tolerant individuals or species (Anthony et al., 2017; van Oppen et al., 2017) . To predict the success of these interventions requires models of coral-symbiont bleaching dynamics that explicitly consider the tolerance-enabling trait, such as sensitivity to reactive oxygen concentration. Further these bleaching models must be applied in a realistic, spatially-resolved environmental setting to optimise deployment.",

(2003) ). This oversight is being addressed with the increasing awareness of the impacts of climate change on the coral-symbiont relationship. The coralsymbiont relationship was first modelled using a dynamic energy budget approach (Muller et al., 2009; Eynaud et al., 2011) . Gustafsson et al. (2013) also explicitly modelled the coral-symbiont relationship, and included some more mechanistic process description such as diffusive limitation of nutrient uptake. Gustafsson et al. (2014) added photo-oxidative stress, and in particular the xanthophyll cycle, reaction centre dynamics and reactive oxygen build-up, to their earlier work, showing that heterotrophic feeding provided protection from temperature-enhanced photo-oxidative stress. Most recently, Cunning et al. (2017) have also shown that the balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrogen sources influences the steady-state of the coral-symbiont system, where bleached or unbleached are two final states.",

A simplified form of the Gustafsson et al.

The models provides skilful predictions of the drivers of coral processes such as temperature, spectrally-resolved bottom light, and water column concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients and particulate organic matter across the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef from 2011-present (Skerratt et al., 2018) . Furthermore, the eReefs project includes bespoke model generation that allows high-resolution models to be nested within the 1 km regional hindcast (RECOM -RElocatable Coastal Ocean Model).",

The model explicitly represents the coral host and the zooxanthellae biomass, pigment concentration, nutrient status, as well as the reaction centre and xanthophyll cycle dynamics. The process-based model of the coralsymbiont relationship is incorporated into the eReefs 3D coupled hydrodynamicbiogeochemical model of the Great Barrier Reef, and a simulation run of the 2016 bleaching event in the \u223c1 km configuration and a \u223c200 m Davies Reef configuration. The model behaviour is analysed at both scales, and model uncertainty discussed. Finally, with a model that captures the impact of temperature, solar radiation and water column inorganic and particulate nutrients on coral bleaching, we consider future applications in the management of the Great Barrier Reef.",

The Schmidt number is the ratio of the diffusivity of momentum, \u03bd, and mass, D x , and varies with temperature, salinity and nutrient species. The mass transfer rate constant S x can be thought of as the height of water cleared of nutrient per unit of time by the watercoral exchange. The capture of organic particles (phytoplankton, zooplankton, labile detritus) is also represented as an areal flux. Ribes and Atkinson (2007) considered whether mass transfer limits apply to particulate matter on reefs, and found for coral rubble communities only a weak velocity dependence, suggesting filter feeders overcame any diffusion limitations (see also Monismith et al. (2010) ). Thus, instead of using a velocity-dependent mass transfer rate like was used for dissolved tracers (Eq. (9)), capture of organic particles, G, is represented by a constant mass transfer rate coefficient, S part , multiplied by the sum of the concentration of each of organic constituents in the water column. The calculated capture rate is limited to the maximum growth rate of the coral tissue, \u03bc CH CH max (Table A .4). The maximum fluxes of both nutrients and particulates from the overlying water are multiplied by the effective projected area fraction of the coral (A eff ) to account for corals covering only a fraction of the bottom.",

The box shows that to generate structural material for an additional cell requires the equivalent of 100% internal reserves of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus of one cell. This figure shows the discrete growth of 2 cells to 3, requiring both the generation of new structural material from reserves and the reserves being diluted as a result of the number of cells in which they are divided increasing from 2 to 3. Thus the internal reserves for nitrogen after the population increases from 2 to 3 is given by: two from the initial 2 cells, minus one for building structural material of the new cell, shared across the 3 offspring, to give 1/3. The same logic applies to carbon and phosphorus reserves, with phosphorus reserves being reduced to 1/6, and carbon reserves being exhausted. In contrast, pigment is not required for structural material so the only reduction is through dilution; the 3/4 content of 2 cells is shared among 3 cells to equal 1/2 in the 3 cells. This schematic shows one limitation of a population-style model whereby reserves are 'shared' across the population (as opposed to individual based modelling, Beckmann and Hense, 2004). A proof of the conservation of mass for this scheme, including under mixing of populations of suspended microalgae, is given in Baird et al. (2004a) . The model equations also include terms affecting internal reserves through nutrient uptake, light absorption, respiration and mortality that are not shown in this simple schematic.

As this biomass is per unit area, and includes a correction for corals being only viable on A eff of the area, \u03b6 CH needs to be divided by A eff in the equations. The model does not consider coral host mortality due to thermal stress directly. The impact of zooxanthellae expulsion on the host is a reduced translocation of organic matter from the symbiont to the host, reducing growth if heterotrophic feeding is growth limiting.",

This ratio is maintained constant through time by assuming xanthophyll synthesis is \u0398 chl2xan multiplied by the chlorophyll a synthesis.

Similarly, a constant ratio of synthesis of peridinin, chlorophyll c 2 and \u03b2-carotene accessory pigments to chlorophyll a ensures these accessory pigments also maintain a constant ratio.

If the photon is absorbed by a photosynthetic pigment, then it will result in a change in either the internal reserves of carbon, the reaction centre state, or the concentration of reactive oxygen species. Like absorption by pigments, the photons interact with the reaction centres as a proportion of the total number of reaction centres. If the photon encounters an oxidised reaction centre, the reserves are deplete and the RuBisCO enzyme active, then the only change will be an increase in carbon reserves (i.e. carbon fixation). If the photon encounters an oxidised reaction centre, but fixation is inhibited, then an oxidised reaction centre becomes reduced. If the photon hits a reduced reaction centre, then a reduced reaction centre becomes inhibited.

The form of Eq.

(20) to 0.73), and that for a sustained period (2 summer months) 2\u00b0C (equivalent to 16 degree heating weeks) causes maximal stress (a * Q ox = 0). If the climatological temperature is below 26\u00b0C, then \u0394T is given by the model bottom temperature minus 26\u00b0C. The constant 2\u00b0C represents the temperature anomaly above which activity of oxidised reaction centres is zero. For \u0394T < 0\u00b0C, = a * 1 Q ox , and all oxidised reaction centres are active, and \u0394T > 2\u00b0C, = a * 0 Q ox , and all oxidised reaction centres are inactive. Both the constant 2\u00b0C, and the use of a seasonally-varying seabed climatological temperature which is based on all available, but nonetheless limited, number of in situ observations and interpolated onto a coarse 0.5\u00b0grid, are key uncertainties worth consideration in future work.",

Thus for a photon flux of 250 mol photon m \u22122 d \u22121 , a relatively low light level for midday, the time-interval between individual photon interceptions is 385 \u00d7 10 \u221220 /(250/A V ) \u00d7 (1/ 86400) \u2248 0.1 s. As this turnover is much quicker than other processes represented in the photosystem model, it has the potential to slow the model integration. A solution is to divide the terms in Eqs. (23)-(25) by 106. This results in reaction centre dynamics varying on an hourly, rather than second, time-scale. The slower response of the reaction centres has only small feedbacks to other terms in the photosystem model, and maintains conservation of reaction centre numbers in the calculation.",

Fig. 5 . Pigment-specific absorption coefficients for the dominant pigments found in Symbiodinium determined using laboratory standards in solvent in a 1 cm vial. Green lines are photosynthetic pigments, red lines are photoprotective pigments constructed from 563 measured wavelengths. Circles represent the wavelengths at which the optical properties are calculated in the simulations. The black line represents the weighted sum of the photosynthetic pigments (Eq. (18)), with the weighting calculated from the ratio of each pigment concentration to chlorophyll a. Black crosses represent the chl a-specific absorption coefficient of all pigments at the wavelengths used in the simulations. The spectra are wavelength-shifted from their raw measurement by the ratio of the refractive index of the solvent to the refractive index of water (1.352 for acetone used with chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c 2 and \u03b2-carotene; 1.361 for ethanol used with peridinin, diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin; 1.330 for water). The integral from 340 to 700 nm of the chl a-specific absorption coefficient using the 23 model wavelengths is only 0.72% greater than using the 563 measured wavelengths. Thus for white light incident on cells with a zero package effect, 23 wavelengths is sufficient to compute the spectrally-resolved absorption. For highly packaged cells, the absorption cross-section is flattened (Kirk, 1994) , so the error will be even less than 0.72%.

River concentrations of sediment and nutrient were based on mean values from observations over a 10 year period (Furnas, 2003) . Separate means were obtained for wet-(the Fly, and the northern most 6 rivers in Queensland) and dry-(remainder) catchment rivers, and multiplied by guaged flows to obtain river loads. The model uses a novel river boundary condition (Herzfeld, 2015) that discharges the river freshwater load in a brackish surface plume whose salinity and thickness is calculated to account for upstream flow in the salt wedge and in-estuary mixing between density layers. The coral distribution in the model is a combination of the eAtlas features map, or, where available, a satellite-derived coral zonation (Roelfsema et al., 2018) . Fig. 6 .

The model predicted reactive oxygen stress has a similar spatial distribution as the observed bleaching from aerial surveys (Fig. 8, bottom left) with the exception that the model bathymetry is too deep at most of the offshore reefs to accumulate oxidative stress.

Snapshots of reactive oxygen accumulation per zooxanthellae cell in the 1 km eReefs model, from left to right, on the 1st of January, February, March and April of 2016, and compared to the aerial bleaching surveys conducted in March-April 2016 (left, Hughes et al. (2017) ). The background water colour is the model output simulated true colour (Baird et al., 2016b) , and can be used as an indicator of water clarity between reefs on the day. Reefs (\u223c1 km 2 in the model) are coloured white if deeper than 20 m, to indicate they are too deep to bleach in the model; grey if they are sufficiently shallow to potentially bleach, but have reactive oxygen concentrations below [ROS threshold ], and yellow through to red to indicate increasing reactive oxygen stress. The ARC Centre of Excellence National Bleaching Taskforce bleach index scales from 0 (< 1% of colonies bleached), 1 (1-10%), 2 (10-30%), 3 (30-60%) and 4 (60-100%). Two thin black lines show the extent of the Bleaching Survey on the model domain. The reactive oxygen concentration per zooxanthella and bleaching index can be qualitatively compared, but a quantitative comparison would rely on uncertain components of the model.

It is a unique characteristic of the eReefs biogeochemical water column optical model (Baird et al., 2016b) that the processes of absorption by photoautotrophs are photon conserving, such that the photosynthetic growth processes in phytoplankton and benthic plants are a function of stoichiometric combination of photons and nitrogen and phosphorus (Baird et al., 2001 ). This approach is also applied in zooxanthellae, with the Fig. 11 . Model behaviour at Davies Reef at a shallow (3.8 m, top 3 rows) and a deep (18.0 m, bottom three rows) site in March 2016. Panels A and D show the light at the coral surface (PAR, mol photon m \u22122 d \u22121 , scaled on the y-axis to the maximum PAR given in the title), and the normalised reserves of nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. Panels B and E show the state of the xanthophyll cycle as the fraction of heat absorbing (X h ) and heat dissipating (X p ) pigments, the RuBisCO activity (a * Q ox , varying between inactive at 0 and fully active at 1), and the carbon to chlorophyll ratio (scaled on the y-axis so the minimum C:Chl ratio of 20 g/g is 0, and 1 is 180 g/ g). Panels C and F show the state of the reaction centres, and the rate of bleaching (\u00d710 d \u22121 ). absorption coefficient of the multiple pigments determining the number of photons absorbed, and then this quantity reduces reaction centres, or accumulates carbon or reactive oxygen, in stoichiometrically determined ratios. By using these constraints the model is able to resolve reaction centre state (Fig. 4) , and include the processes of photoinhibition and reactive oxygen generation, with the inclusion of just a few new model parameters, such as the stoichiometric ratio of RCII units to photons, m RCII , and a few temperature-dependent reaction rates.",

A more sophisticated, ecosystem or habitat style model would consider multiple coral and seagrass types inhabiting particular niches on the seabed, and interacting with a range of herbivorous fish (Bozec et al., 2018) . Such an improved representation of coral mortality, which could include other processes such as cyclone damage and starfish grazing (Babcock et al., 2016) , would remove the need for the ad-hoc quadratic mortality term for coral hosts.

Nonetheless, it has not captured all bleaching events accurately, and work is under way to include solar radiation in bleaching algorithms (Skirving et al., 2018) . Even with additional considerations such as solar radiation, satellite algorithms will always be limited to the estimation of near-surface properties, and their inability to consider factors affecting bleaching such as dissolved nutrients (D'Angelo and Wiedenmann, 2014) that cannot be remotely-sensed. Furthermore satellite observations will never be predictive. Thus, the near real time prediction and forecasting of coral bleaching by a biogeochemical model such as developed here that can consider the history of temperature, light and other environmental conditions at the surface of the corals provides a means to overcome some of these limitations.",

The model simulations were developed as part of the eReefs Project, a public-private collaboration between Australia's leading operational and scientific research agencies, government, and corporate Australia. The authors wish to thank the many scientists involved in the project, in particular Mike Herzfeld, John Andrewatha, Nugzar Margvelashvili, Karen Wild-Allen, Barbara Robson, Andy Steven and Cedric Robillot. Observations used in the eReefs Project include those from the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and the Marine Monitoring Program (MMP). ARC Centre of Excellence National Bleaching Taskforce survey data was download from https://doi.org/ 10.1002/ecy.2092 (Hughes et al., 2017) . The authors appreciate fruitful discussions with Peter Ralph as the model was developed from the one-polyp model of Gustafsson et al. (2014) to the model described here. Lesley Clementson kindly provided the pigment-specific absorption coefficients from unpublished experiments conducted at the CSIRO Hobart Laboratories. This absorption data, and the entire model code used in this study, is available at https://github.com/csiro-coasts/EMS, or on request from the authors.",

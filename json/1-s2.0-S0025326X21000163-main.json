    "abstract": "Coral skeletal growth anomaly (GA) is a common coral disease. It has been considered as a pathological condition comparable to abnormal tissue growth in mammals, but little is known about the molecular changes underlying coral GA. To investigate the molecular pathology of GA, we compared the proteome between normal and GAaffected tissues of the brain coral Platygyra carnosa using iTRAQ-labeling and LC-MS/MS, which quantified 818 proteins and identified 117 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). GO analyses revealed DEPs that might be related to GA included \"translational elongation\", \"proteasome core complex\", \"amine metabolic processes\" and \"lysosome\". Several proteins implicated in calcification and fluorescence were differentially expressed at both protein and mRNA level. Protein-protein interaction network suggested possible involvement of TNF receptor signaling in GA. Overall, our results provided novel insights into the molecular pathology of coral GA, which will pave the way for determination of the causative agent(s) of this coral disease.",

The prevalence of GA has been associated with bleaching intensity and local anthropogenic stressors such as high phosphorus concentration (McClanahan et al., 2009) , as well as global stressors such as sea-surface temperature anomalies (Bruno et al., 2007) . Hence, GA constitutes a threat to coral reef systems, especially to those reefs that are in proximity to highly populated cities.",

A model has been proposed to link environmental pollution and reduced coral health to GA (McClanahan et al., 2009) , but the cause effect relationship between these environmental factors and GA development has not been confirmed. Recent molecular analyses revealed differential expression of stress-related proteins (Domart-Coulon et al., 2006) , oncogenesis-related genes (Spies and Takabayashi, 2013) and immune system genes (Zhang et al., 2017; Frazier et al., 2017) associated with coral GA. Significantly higher activity of the key immunity enzyme phenoloxidase (PO) was detected in GA affected tissue of Acropora hyacinthus, suggesting that GA triggers immune responses (Palmer and Baird, 2018) . In independent transcriptomic analyses of GA in Platygyra carnosa and Montipora capitata, genes implicated in immune response and oncogenesis were up-regulated in GA affected tissue (Zhang et al., 2017; Frazier et al., 2017) . These molecular data explored the potential underlying mechanism of GA, but mainly at the gene expression (mRNA) level.",

Our list of P. carnosa DEPs included five HSPs, including HSP 90-alpha (HSP90AA1), 10 kDa HSP (HSPE1), HSP70 A-8 (HSPA8), HSP 75 kDa (HSP75) and heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein-like (HSPA8/HSC71). Except HSPE1, all of the above DEPs were upregulated in GA affected tissue (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1) and were associated with GO Biological Process (GOBP) terms related to stress, including response to oxidative stress (GO:0006979), response to stress (GO:0006950) and response to osmotic stress (GO:0006970).

Comparison of the result of GO enrichment analysis further demonstrate the qualitative differences between DEG and DEP.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which serves as a homeostatic mechanism to maintain cell populations in tissues and is part of the immune system (Norbury and Zhivotovsky, 2004) . The Apoptosis Inducible Factor (AIF) is a mitochondrial protein that can trigger caspase independent apoptosis. AIF could reportedly interact with TRADD and is hence one of the downstream components of TNF signaling. While PPI network analysis related the DEPs with proteins involved in TNF receptor activation, AIF was down-regulated. In addition, none of the apoptotic caspase proteins were detected in the differential expression analysis. Lysosomal proteins, which could also involve in the degradation process during apoptosis, were also downregulated. Overall, our proteomic data suggested that apoptosis was unlikely to be triggered in GA affected tissue.",

In the current study, chaperone proteins, including heat shock proteins (HSPs) 90-alpha, 75 kDa HSP, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein-like were up-regulated in GA affected tissue.

Up-regulation of FPs was consistently detected in this proteomic study and in the previous transcriptomic study (Zhang et al., 2017) . Increased expression of FPs in GA affect tissues might be correlated with the coloration alteration in GA affected P. carnosa tissues (Fig. 1 in Zhang et al., 2017) . In corals, Green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) and GFP-like proteins are the major FPs. The variations in the absorption spectrum of GFP or GFP-like proteins will affect the pigmentation of coral tissue. GFP or GFP-like proteins absorb high energy (low wavelength) light wave and offer photoprotection to coral tissues (Smith et al., 2013; DeSalvo et al., 2008) . GFP or GFP-like proteins have been suggested to contribute to the coloration changes of different corals species in response to wounding and infestation by epibionts/parasites (Bonesso et al., 2017) . In Porites lobata, high abundance of GFPs and high phenoloxidase activity were observed in the proliferating regions that exhibit accelerated growth (D'Angelo et al., 2012) . GFP-like proteins could also serve as a superoxide radical quencher or oxidant and protect coral tissues from reactive oxidant stress (Bou-Abdallah et al., 2006; Palmer et al., 2009) . Interestingly, our dataset also hinted to the up-regulation of certain immune system components, such as a number of TNF receptor associating proteins. SOD2, a detoxification enzyme that metabolizes reactive oxygen species (Chen et al., 2009) , was also up-regulated, suggesting the need for metabolism of ROS in GA-affected tissue. Hence, coloration change in GA affected tissue, which is likely the result of differential expression of FPs, could be associated with the intrinsic protection mechanism.",

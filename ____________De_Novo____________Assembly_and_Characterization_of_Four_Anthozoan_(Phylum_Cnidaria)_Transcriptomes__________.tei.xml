			<abstract>
				<p>Many non-model species exemplify important biological questions but lack the sequence resources required to study the genes and genomic regions underlying traits of interest. Reef-building corals are famously sensitive to rising seawater temperatures, motivating ongoing research into their stress responses and long-term prospects in a changing climate. A comprehensive understanding of these processes will require extending beyond the sequenced coral genome (Acropora digitifera) to encompass diverse coral species and related anthozoans. Toward that end, we have assembled and annotated reference transcriptomes to develop catalogs of gene sequences for three scleractinian corals (Fungia scutaria, Montastraea cavernosa, Seriatopora hystrix) and a temperate anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima). High-throughput sequencing of cDNA libraries produced ~20-30 million reads per sample, and de novo assembly of these reads produced ~75-110 thousand transcripts from each sample with size distributions (mean ~ 1.4 kb, N50~ 2 kb) comparable to the distribution of gene models from the coral genome (mean ~1.7 kb, N50 ~ 2.2 kb). Each assembly includes matches for more than half the gene models from A. digitifera (54-67%), and many reasonably complete transcripts (~5,300-6,700) spanning nearly the entire gene (ortholog hit ratios ≥ 0.75). The catalogs of gene sequences developed in this study made it possible to identify hundreds to thousands of orthologs across diverse scleractinian species and related taxa. We used these sequences for phylogenetic inference, recovering known relationships and demonstrating superior performance over phylogenetic trees constructed using single mitochondrial loci. The resources developed in this study provide gene sequences and genetic markers for several anthozoan species. To enhance the utility of these resources for the research community, we developed searchable databases enabling researchers to rapidly recover sequences for genes of interest. Our analysis of de novo assembly quality highlights metrics that we expect will be useful for evaluating the relative quality of other de novo transcriptome assemblies. The identification of orthologous sequences and phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrates the feasibility of these methods for clarifying the substantial uncertainties in the existing scleractinian phylogeny.</p>

Cnidarians are among early-diverging or basal metazoans and occupy a key position as a sister taxon to the bilaterians <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dunn et al. 2008)</ref>. Many cnidarians play an important role in marine trophic cascades, due to their mutualistic relationship with dinoflagellate species of the genus Symbiodinium that reside inside of cnidarian host cells. This relationship is based on nutritional exchange in which Symbiodinium spp.</p><p>provide the cnidarian host with products from photosynthesis in return for inorganic nutrients and a stable, high-light environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davy et al. 2012)</ref>. The paramount examples of this partnership are the reef-building corals, which form the trophic and structural foundation of productive and biodiverse coral reef ecosystems. Anthropogenic stressors, especially those associated with global climate change, are gravely threatening these reef ecosystems, including the corals themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Douglas 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Weis and Allemand 2009)</ref>. Insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie coral-dinoflagellate symbioses and their stress response to environmental perturbation is critical for future management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems.</p><p>To date, there are two publically available, sequenced genomes from the Anthozoa: the symbiotic coral Acropora digitifera <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Shinzato et al. 2011)</ref> and the non-symbiotic sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Putnam et al. 2007)</ref>.

These studies are adding to earlier generation omics studies (EST studies, subtractive hybridization and cDNA microarrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Meyer and Weis 2012)</ref>) and are providing information on the mechanisms of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis and coral bleaching, a stress response that results from the breakdown of the partnership <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Weis 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Davy et al. 2012)</ref>.

In addition, many resources are from aposymbiotic (lacking dinoflagellate symbionts) samples or nonsymbiotic species, which limits the study of interplay between the two partners. One goal of this work is to increase the number and diversity of anthozoan resources for comparative, phylogenetic and functional analyses.</p><p>In this study, we present transcriptomes from four anthozoans: the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt, 1835) and the corals Fungia scutaria <ref type="bibr">(Lamarck, 1801)</ref>, Montastraea cavernosa (Linnaeus, 1767), and Seriatopora hystrix (Dana, 1846) in varying symbiotic states, life history stages and geographic locations <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>. These species are of particular interest to investigations into the molecular mechanisms associated with the onset, maintenance and breakdown of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses. We highlight how these transcriptomes can be used in applications ranging from targeted gene searches to orthologous group predictions and phylogenomic analysis.</p><p>In addition, we outline a method to screen for cross-contamination between sequencing libraries that can be broadly applied to other transcriptome studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample collection and RNA extraction</head><p>All four anthozoan species examined in this study engage in symbiosis with Symbiodinium spp., and therefore RNA extractions typically include contributions from the dinoflagellate symbionts at some level. Here, two samples (M. cavernosa and S. hystrix) were collected from symbiotic specimens and two samples (F. scutaria and A. elegantissima) were collected from nominally aposymbiotic stages or specimens <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table    1</ref>). Larvae of F. scutaria were reared in filtered seawater at Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology following fertilization and development, and remained symbiont-free during development <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Schnitzler and Weis 2010)</ref>. The aposymbiotic specimen of A. elegantissima was collected in that condition in the field.</p><p>Total RNA was extracted from S. hystrix, F. scutaria, and A. elegantissma using the following methods. S. hystrix tissue was stored in RNAlater® Stabilization Solution (Qiagen, CA, US) and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit <ref type="bibr">(Qiagen, CA, US)</ref> according to the manufacturer's protocol. Whole animal specimens of A. elegantissima (aposymbiotic) and F. scutaria (larvae) were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80. RNA was extracted using a combination of the TRIzol® RNA isolation protocol (Life Technologies, CA, US) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, US). The TRIzol® protocol was used for initial steps up to and including the chloroform extraction. Following tissue homogenization, an additional centrifugation step was performed at 12,000 x g for 10 min to remove tissue debris. After the chloroform extraction, the aqueous layer was combined with equal volume of 100% EtOH and the RNeasy Mini Kit was used to perform washes following the manufacturer's protocol.</p><p>A core sample of M. cavernosa was collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80. Total RNA from M. cavernosa was extracted following a modified TRIzol® protocol with a 12 M LiCl precipitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mazel et al. 2003)</ref>. Briefly, the coral fragment was vortexed in TRIzol® reagent for 15 min and then processed according to the manufacturer's instructions through phase separation. To precipitate RNA, 0.25 ml of isopropanol and 0.25 ml of a high salt solution (0.8 M sodium citrate and 1.2 M NaCl) per 1 ml of TRIzol® used was added to the aqueous supernatant. The addition of high salt solution removes proteoglycan and polysaccharide contaminates. The solution was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4°. After centrifugation, the standard TRIzol® protocol was followed through the ethanol wash. To remove PCR inhibitors of an unknown nature that are frequently encountered in coral samples, RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of 12 M LiCl, then incubated for 30 min at -20°. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min at room temperature and washed with 75% EtOH (1 ml per 1 ml of TRIzol®) followed by centrifugation at 7,500 x g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the RNA pellet was air-dried.</p><p>The extracted total RNA from each sample was DNase-treated using a TURBO DNA-Free Kit (Ambion, CA, US) to remove genomic DNA contamination. RNA quantity and quality was assessed using the NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, US) and gel electrophoresis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation of sequencing libraries</head><p>Polyadenylated RNA was purified from µg of total RNA using the Magnetic mRNA Isolation Kit (New England Biolabs, MA, US). First strand cDNA was synthesized using ProtoScript M-MuLV FS-cDNA Synthesis Kit <ref type="bibr">(New England Biolabs, MA, US)</ref> according to the manufacturer's protocol and modified oligonucleotides in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref> in File S1). Purified, tailed cDNA was combined with T4 DNA Ligase Buffer (New England Biolabs, MA, US), T4</p><p>DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs, MA, US), and the double stranded adaptors and the solution was incubated at 12° for at least 6 hours. Ligation products were purified then amplified using custom sample-specific barcodes ("indices") designed with a 3-bp minimum Hamming distance based on Illumina barcodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Illumina 2014)</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table S1</ref> in File S1). PCR included template cDNA, Phusion Taq polymerase buffer (Thermo Scientific, MA, US), dNTPs, 5' Illumina "i5" barcoding oligo and 3' Illumina "i7" multiplex oligonucleotide and Phusion High Fidelity Taq polymerase (Thermo Scientific, MA, US). Reactions were incubated at 98° for 30 seconds, followed by 17-21 cycles of: 98° for 10 s, 63° for 30 s, 72° for 1.5 min. Reactions were amplified for the minimum cycle number required to produce a visible product on a 1% agarose gel. PCR products were size-selected by excising the 350-550 bp fraction from a 2% agarose gel. Finally, size-selected sequencing libraries were extracted using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, GA, US).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequencing, processing and assembly</head><p>cDNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 at University of Oregon's Genomics Core Facility (Eugene, OR). All cDNA libraries were pooled on a single lane to produce 100 bp paired-end reads. Raw sequences were filtered using custom Perl scripts to remove uninformative (matching adaptors in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref> in File S1, or poly-A tail) and low quality reads (&gt; 20 positions with quality scores &lt; 20) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Meyer et al. 2011</ref>).</p><p>All custom scripts used in this study are available online at GitHub (https://github.com/Eli-Meyer). The high-quality filtered reads were then assembled using default settings in Trinity v2.0.2, a de Bruijn graph based assembler that uses paired-end data to reconstruct transcripts and group these into components intended to represent the collection of transcripts originating from a single gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Grabherr et al. 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional annotation</head><p>To develop these assemblies as resources for functional studies, we assigned putative gene names and functional categories (Gene Ontology, GO; and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; KEGG) to assembled transcripts based on sequence comparisons with online databases. All sequence comparisons were conducted using BLAST+ from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Package version 2.2.29) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Altschul et al. 1990)</ref>. Gene names were assigned by comparing transcript sequences against UniProt protein sequence databases (SwissProt and TREMBL) using BLASTx with an expect value (E value) cutoff of 10 -4 . Each transcript was assigned a gene name based on its best match, excluding matches with uninformative names (e.g. uncharacterized, unknown, or hypothetical). GO terms describing biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components were assigned to each transcript based on GO-UniProt associations of its best match, downloaded from the Gene Ontology website <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(The Gene Ontology et al. 2000)</ref>. KEGG orthology terms were assigned from singledirectional best hit BLAST searches of each transcriptome on the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Moriya et al. 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference transcriptome databases</head><p>The sequence data used in this study have been archived in several public repositories. To enhance the utility of these resources for the coral research community, we have also developed searchable databases and made these publicly available on the author's laboratory website hosted at Oregon State University <ref type="bibr">(Meyer)</ref>. Databases were produced using the open-source SQLite software library and can be queried directly using a publicly accessible web form. To demonstrate the utility of our searchable databases for rapidly identifying genes of interest, we searched each database for a few genes previously studied in cnidarians, including a cell adhesion molecule (sym32) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Reynolds et al. 2000)</ref>, a cysteine biosynthesis enzyme (cystathionine β-synthase, Cbs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Shinzato et al. 2011)</ref>, and a fluorescent protein (GFP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mazel et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Shinzato et al. 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Smith-Keune and Dove 2008). For comparison with these simple text searches, we also conducted a more comprehensive search for each gene based on reciprocal BLAST.</p><p>Representative sequences for each gene were obtained from the UniProt database (version 2014_09, downloaded October 20, 2014), and searched against each assembly using tBLASTn (bit-score ≥ 45). The matching transcripts were then reciprocally compared against UniProt using BLASTx. Reciprocal matches were evaluated at the level of gene names: transcripts identified by searching with a target gene (e.g. B5T1L4, GFP from Acropora millepora) were accepted if they reciprocally matched a different gene with corresponding annotation (e.g. Q9U6Y6, a GFP gene from Anemonia manjano).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluating gene content and completeness of assembly</head><p>An ideal reference transcriptome would include all genes present in the genome of an organism but low or tissue-specific expression can lead to incomplete sampling of genes during cDNA library preparation. To evaluate the gene representation of our assemblies, we searched each assembly for sequence similarity with a core set of conserved eukaryotic genes (CEGMA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Parra et al. 2007)</ref>) and with gene models from sequenced anthozoan genomes: the coral Acropora digitifera [OIST: adi_v1.0.1] <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Shinzato et al. 2011</ref>) and the anemone Nematostella vectensis [assembly version: Nemve1] <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Putnam et al. 2007)</ref>. Sequence comparisons were conducted using NCBI's BLASTx Basic Local Alignment Search Tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Altschul et al. 1990)</ref>, and bit-scores ≥ 50 considered significant.</p><p>An ideal transcriptome assembly would also include complete transcripts as contiguous sequences or contigs, but variation in coverage and sequence characteristics lead to fragmented assemblies consisting of partial transcripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of our assemblies in reconstructing complete transcripts, we calculated the Ortholog Hit Ratio (OHR), a metric ranging from 0-1 that indicates the proportion of each gene included in the assembled transcript <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(O'Neil et al. 2010)</ref>. Each assembly was compared to gene models from the N. vectensis genome using BLASTx to identify orthologs. We calculated OHR first with a relatively stringent approach (OHRHITS), as the proportion of each N. vectensis gene included within local alignments with assembled transcripts (HSPs in BLASTx output). Since this approach excludes divergent regions, we calculated OHR with an alternative and more inclusive approach (OHRORF), as the ratio of the transcript's longest ORF (in the BLASTx-defined reading frame) relative to the length of its corresponding N. vectensis protein. When multiple transcripts matched a single gene we considered only the longest OHR. Distributions of maximum OHR scores and summary statistics were examined to evaluate the completeness of each assembly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screening for biological contamination</head><p>All species used in this study engage in symbiotic associations with intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts and therefore RNA extracted from these specimens is expected to include contributions from both animal hosts and dinoflagellate symbionts. To evaluate these contributions we conducted a series of sequence comparisons aiming to identify the taxonomic origin of each transcript ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>). Transcripts were compared with a series of sequence databases using BLAST v. BLASTx. The taxonomic origin of each sequence was categorized as follows. First, transcripts matching rRNA or mitochondrial sequences were assigned to those categories.</p><p>Transcripts matching Symbiodinium genes more closely than coral genes, that did not return a metazoan hit as their best match in nr, were assigned to the dinoflagellate category. Transcripts matching coral genes more closely than Symbiodinium genes, that also matched metazoan records or lacked matches in nr, were categorized as metazoan.</p><p>Transcripts that showed conflicting results (metazoan in one db but non-metazoan in the other) were categorized as "unknown". Transcripts lacking any match to either coral or Symbiodinium genes were assigned based on taxonomic annotation of the best match in nr, if available. This series of decisions made it possible to classify each transcript based on origin (ribosomal, mitochondrial, other metazoan genes, dinoflagellate, or "other taxa", which includes prokaryotes, "uncertain", or "no match").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screening for cross-contamination</head><p>During preliminary analysis of the transcriptome assemblies, we observed a few orthologs with unexpectedly high sequence similarity (&gt; 99%) among species.</p><p>Since cross-contamination could realistically occur at several different stages during multiplex library preparation and sequencing, we tested for evidence of crosscontamination in our transcriptome assemblies and developed a pipeline to eliminate contaminating sequences. To evaluate the extent of cross contamination in our libraries, we mapped the cleaned reads used to produce each assembly against that assembly using the Trinity utility align_and_estimate_abundance.pl <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Haas et al. 2013)</ref>. We then compared all transcriptome libraries sequenced and prepared together using BLASTn to identify nearly identical sequences present in multiple assemblies (bit-score ≥ 100). This analysis identified many sequences occurring in multiple assemblies, which were highly abundant in one sample (consistent with this being their true origin) but very low abundance (&lt;10-fold lower) in other assemblies (consistent with cross-contamination).</p><p>To evaluate the level of sequence similarity expected among anthozoan transcriptomes, for comparison with the similarity observed among our assemblies, we compared publicly available transcript assemblies produced independently in different labs (Pocillopora damicornis, (Traylor-Knowles et al. 2011); A. digitifera, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Shinzato et al. 2011</ref>); and A. millepora, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Meyer et al. 2009)</ref>). To eliminate putative cross-contaminants identified in our assemblies, we first compared assemblies using BLASTn to identify highly similar sequences (bit-score ≥ 100). We then estimated the abundance of each transcript in each assembly by mapping and counting reads from each library against the assembly produced from those reads, using the Trinity utility align_and_estimate_abundance.pl. To identify and remove sequences that might result from cross-contamination, we categorized each transcript based on sequence similarity and relative expression in all other assemblies. Any transcripts with nearly-identical matches in more than one assembly were assigned to the assembly in which each was most abundant, if the sequence was at least 10-fold more abundant in that library than any others. Alternatively, transcripts found at comparable levels (&lt; 10-fold difference) in multiple assemblies were flagged as "unknown origin" and excluded from further analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of SSR markers</head><p>Simple sequence repeats (SSRs), also known as microsatellites, are sequences with repetitive 2-5 base pairs of DNA. These molecular markers have been widely used for studies of genome mapping, genetic linkage and population structure. Although SSRs have largely been replaced with sequencing-based approaches for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, in some situations they may still be the most practical option. To demonstrate the utility of transcriptome assemblies for SSR marker development and identify SSR markers for the four species described here, we used a pipeline we have previously described for identifying SSRs in coral sequence data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Davies et al. 2013)</ref>. In brief, sequences containing repetitive regions (≥ 30 bp, ≤ 15% deviation from perfect repeat structure, ≥ 30 bp flanking regions) were identified using RepeatMasker <ref type="bibr">(Smit et al. 1996</ref><ref type="bibr">(Smit et al. -2010</ref>, and then assembled using CAP3 to eliminate redundancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Huang and Madan 1999)</ref>. Target sequences were further screened for redundancy using BLASTn <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Altschul et al. 1990)</ref> to identify unique targets within each repeat type (e.g., AT, CCG, etc.). Finally, primer sequences flanking these SRRs were developed using Primer3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Rozen and Skaletsky 1999)</ref>, targeting regions 150-500 bp with 45-65% GC content.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of orthologous groups</head><p>To facilitate comparative studies of cnidarian gene sequences, and demonstrate the utility of our transcriptome assemblies for phylogenetic analysis, we identified orthologous groups among the four transcriptomes generated in this study.

These resources varied in the types of sequencing technologies used to create them and this resulted in differing degrees of assembly completeness, ranging from whole genomes to EST libraries <ref type="table">(Table S2</ref> in File S1). All resources were converted into candidate protein coding sequences using the package TransDecoder (transdecoder.sourceforge.net) that identifies open reading frames.

All taxa used in searches for orthologous groups were included and A. queenslandica served as the outgroup. The Transdecoder catalog of proteins for each organism was made into a local BLAST database. Then, the mitochondrial protein sequences of COI, ND2, ND4 and ND5 were found from BLASTx searches against our local databases, UniProt or NCBI databases <ref type="table">(Tables S3 and S4</ref> in File S1).

First, each group of orthologs was aligned using MAFFT v. 6.864b with 1000 iterations. Ambiguous or uninformative positions were removed from the alignment using Gblocks v. 0.91b <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Castresana 2000)</ref>. Then, single-gene ML trees for each group inferred with FastTree2 (Price et al. 2010) were screened for paralogy with PhyloTreePruner and the longest sequence for each taxon was retained. The pruned orthologous groups were then merged into a single matrix using FASconCAT v. 1.0 (Kück and Meusemann 2010). To examine the impact of missing data on tree topology, two trees were constructed. In the conservative tree, 14-15 taxa were sampled per ortholog for a total of groups (73,833 unique alignment positions). The relaxed tree allowed more missing data, requiring only at least 10 taxa sampled per ortholog for a total of 2,896 groups (535,413 unique alignment positions). For each dataset, ML trees were inferred with RAxML v. 8.0.26 using the WAG+GAMMA+F substitution model <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Whelan and Goldman 2001)</ref>. Topology for each tree was selected from 100 replicate trees, and nodal support values are based on 100 and 500 bootstrap replicates in the conservative and relaxed trees respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequencing and de novo assembly</head><p>The four libraries described here were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 (each occupying 1/6 th of a lane), yielding on average 26.3 million paired reads per library (range: 21.2-30.3, <ref type="table">Table S5</ref> in File S1). A fraction of these (22% on average; range 14-28%) were removed during quality and adaptor filtering prior to assembly. Assembly of the remaining high-quality reads produced on average ~170,000 transcripts. This is substantially higher than the number of genes in sequenced cnidarian genomes <ref type="bibr">(23,677 in A. digitifera, 27,273 in N. vectensis)</ref>, which likely results from redundancy, fragmentation in the assemblies and biological contamination. Assemblies included many small contigs (on average, 47% were &lt; 400 bp) that were unlikely to provide significant matches, so for analyses based on sequence homology we considered only contigs ≥ 400 bp (average n=91,792). For these core transcriptome datasets used for downstream analyses, the average length ranged from 1.1-1.7 kb and N50 ranged from 1.4-2.7 kb.</p><p>These are slightly shorter than the expected size distribution for a complete cnidarian transcriptome (e.g. average ~ 1,700 and N50 ~ 2,200 bp transcripts in the A. digitifera genome), suggesting incomplete assemblies. Assembly statistics of the four transcriptome references developed in this study are broadly comparable to previously published anthozoan transcriptomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Moya et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Shinzato et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Shinzato et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abascal et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Traylor-Knowles et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lehnert et al. 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Completeness of transcriptomes</head><p>To evaluate the completeness of the transcriptome assemblies from the perspective of gene content, we conducted sequence comparisons with conserved eukaryotic genes and gene models from sequenced relatives. The core eukaryotic genes (CEGMA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Parra et al. 2007</ref>)) are expected to be expressed in most eukaryotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Nakasugi et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sanders et al. 2014)</ref> and are widely used to estimate transcriptome completeness. Sequence comparisons revealed matches for 453 of these conserved genes (98.9%) in A. elegantissma and 456 (99.5%) in F. scutaria, M. cavernosa and S. hystrix <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 2a</ref>).</p><p>For a more comprehensive view of gene representation, the transcriptomes were compared with gene models from sequenced relatives (the coral A. digitifera and the anemone N. vectensis). This analysis identified matches for more than 14,000 gene models in each genome (BLASTx, bit-score ≥ 50): 54-67% of gene models in A.</p><p>digitifera <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 2b</ref>) and 48-49% in N. vectensis. This is comparable to the level of sequence similarity observed among anthozoans with completed genomes. BLASTp comparisons of predicted proteins from the A. digitifera and N. vectensis genomes using the same thresholds recover 35% and 42% of genes in the other genome. This is substantially lower than the optimistic estimates of representation based on CEGMA, perhaps reflecting essential functions and constitutive expression of these highly conserved genes. Comparisons with gene models of closely related taxa appear to provide a more conservative estimate of gene representation in transcriptome assemblies.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of our assemblies in reconstructing complete transcripts, we calculated ortholog hit ratios (OHR) for each final assembly. This method estimates the amount of a de novo transcript contained in the best ortholog from a reference genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(O'Neil et al. 2010)</ref>, ranging from 1 (for complete transcripts) to 0 (for transcript fragments). We calculated OHR based on sequence comparisons with N. vectensis gene models, using two approaches. First, a relatively stringent analysis based on the proportion of each N. vectensis gene included in regions of local similarity (OHRHITS) produced median OHR of 63.8, 64.7, 65.7, and 58.0% for A. elegantissma, F. scutaria, M. cavernosa and S. hystrix, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 2c)</ref>. A more inclusive analysis based on the longest ORF (in BLAST defined frame) produced similar estimates <ref type="bibr">(median OHRORF: 67.4,</ref><ref type="bibr">75.8,</ref><ref type="bibr">77.2,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 60.3% respectively)</ref>. Each assembly included more than 5,000 reasonably complete transcripts spanning at least 75% of the corresponding N.vectensis gene (range: <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">725)</ref>. Overall, these comparisons with existing cnidarian sequence resources quantify the representation and completeness of our assemblies, and provide a framework for comparison with other de novo assemblies. These estimates compare favorably with previous transcriptome completeness estimates for cnidarians <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Sanders et al. 2014)</ref> and several invertebrates (O'Neil and Emrich 2013; Riesgo et al. 2012) using similar methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Annotation of transcriptomes</head><p>Transcripts were annotated using BLAST homology searches against the UniProt databases. Approximately a third of all transcripts matched records in UniProt (range: 30-40%) <ref type="table">(Table S5</ref> in File S1). The relatively low fraction of sequences annotated is attributable in part to sequence lengths: on average, 21% of transcripts &lt;400 bp in length were annotated, as compared with 42% of transcripts 400-1000 bp in length and 78% of transcripts &gt; 1,000 bp. Even among the longest transcripts (&gt; 1 kb), a substantial number of sequences lacked annotated matches in UniProt (range: 6,647-12,090 sequences per assembly). This highlights the well-known bias in taxonomic composition of existing databases, and the value of ongoing gene sequencing in under-represented metazoan taxa for public sequence databases.</p><p>To categorize the biological functions inferred from sequence similarity, Gene Ontology (GO) terms were assigned to transcripts matching GO-annotated records in the UniProt database. This process identified functional annotation for 77% of transcripts with BLAST matches, providing tentative gene identities for a large number of sequences in each assembly (range: 32,299-47,547 transcripts; <ref type="table">Table S5</ref> in File S1). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref> shows the distribution of functional categories across the four transcriptomes, visualized using the Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plotting (WEGO) application. The GO terms were broadly distributed across the three domains and the percentages of sequences mapped to a given sub-ontology were highly similar for all species, and comparable to other invertebrate transcriptomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Riesgo et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">O'Neil et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lehnert et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Moya et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Polato et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Shinzato et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Stefanik et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Traylor-Knowles et al. 2011)</ref>. The similarities in functional distributions of assemblies prepared from diverse species, developmental stages, and symbiotic states highlights the constitutive expression of a broad set of genes in cnidarian transcriptomes. These core genes should facilitate comparative transcriptome studies by increasing the overlap among incomplete libraries.</p><p>To determine taxonomic origin for each transcript, we conducted a series of BLAST searches and filtering steps outlined in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>. Since our assemblies were produced from symbiotic and aposymbiotic specimens, the transcriptomes contain genes not only from anthozoans but also from their associated microbial community. To investigate the relative contributions of these sources we classified each transcript based on sequence similarity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 1</ref>). These analyses confirmed that metazoan sequences comprised the majority of each library as expected. Fortunately, only a small fraction of transcripts were derived from organelles (mitochondria and ribosomes): on average, 212 transcripts (range: 127-284) in each assembly matched rRNA (N. vectensis) and 30 transcripts (range: 16-54) matched the mitochondrial genome (A. tenuis). Notably, almost half of transcripts in each assembly (range: 46.2% to 49.9%) lacked matches to coral or Symbiodinium spp. genes, or NCBI's nr database <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4)</ref>, a range that is consistent with results from other anthozoan transcriptomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Sun et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Karako-Lampert et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Polato et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Traylor-Knowles et al. 2011</ref>). These 'unknown' transcripts may represent lineage-specific genes ('taxonomically-restricted genes') that require further characterization. Comparison with NCBI's nr database revealed that the majority of sequences with matches in one or more databases (59-95%) matched a metazoan sequence better than any other taxon, suggesting they originated from the animal host rather than from dinoflagellate or prokaryotic symbionts. A negligible fraction of transcripts in each assembly (0.8-1.7%) were assigned to the "Other taxa" category, most of which matched either coral or Symbiodinium genes but were classified as "unknown" because of conflicting results in the nr search (e.g. transcripts that matched Symbiodinium more closely than coral, but whose best matches in nr were from metazoans).</p><p>The contribution of algal symbionts varied widely across samples. In nominally aposymbiotic samples of F. scutaria and A. elegantissma, 2.6% of transcripts on average were classified as dinoflagellate in origin <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4)</ref>, which may have resulted either from unexpected presence of symbionts at low abundance in these samples, or genes lacking orthologs in the A. digitifera reference. The symbiotic samples from S. hystrix, in contrast, showed comparable abundance of transcripts classified as metazoan <ref type="bibr">(61,</ref><ref type="bibr">369)</ref> and dinoflagellate in origin <ref type="bibr">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr">724)</ref>. Surprisingly, the M. cavernosa library that was similarly prepared from a symbiotic sample showed only 7,278 transcripts from dinoflagellates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4</ref>). This striking contrast in Symbiodinium contributions from symbiotic specimens may have arisen from differing methods of RNA extraction. For S.</p><p>hystrix, tissue was airbrushed off the coral skeleton directly into RNAlater® Stabilization Solution (Qiagen, CA, US) followed by complete tissue homogenization. In contrast, the M. cavernosa fragment was simply vortexed to disrupt tissue, without physical homogenization. Our findings suggest that omitting physical homogenization during lysis can minimize symbiont contamination for studies aiming to focus on the cnidarian host, while studies investigating both components may benefit from thorough homogenization during extraction. The gene names, functional categories, and putative origin of each transcript are annotated in Tables S6-9 in Files S2-5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene searches of the database</head><p>The resulting annotations and sequences are available in a set of searchable databases hosted by Oregon State University <ref type="bibr">(Meyer)</ref>. To illustrate the utility of databases for cnidarian researchers targeting specific genes, we compared the effectiveness of simple text searches of the databases with reciprocal BLAST (RB) analysis, a more comprehensive approach that requires additional work by the end-user. Text searches targeting a handful of selected genes (cell adhesion molecule sym32, green fluorescent protein GFP, and cystathionine β-synthase Cbs) produced comparable results as RB searches <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table S10</ref> in File S1). Text searches are obviously sensitive to query phrasing; the query "fluorescent" retrieves 51 putative GFP homologs, and functionally related synonyms ("GFP", "chromoprotein") retrieved an additional 10. Interestingly, the Cbs homologs identified in nominally aposymbiotic samples (A. elegantissima and F. scutaria) showed greater sequence similarity with Symbiodinium gene models than coral (A. digitifera) and were classified as dinoflagellate in our assignment procedure ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure    1</ref>), while Cbs homologs in symbiotic samples (M. cavernosa and S. hystrix) included both and metazoan and dinoflagellate transcripts. This unexpected observation of apparently dinoflagellate homologs of Cbs in nominally aposymbiotic samples is noteworthy because of their variable distribution among corals and possible roles in coral nutritional dependency on symbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Shinzato et al. 2011)</ref>. While this finding could be explained by undetected Symbiodinium harbored in these putatively aposymbiotic samples, the uncertainty introduced by these observations suggests that studies investigating the diversity of Cbs homologs across corals may require additional data (e.g. in-situ hybridization) to confirm transcript origins. Overall, the close agreement between rigorous computational searches and simple text searches in these examples illustrates the utility of our searchable online databases for rapidly identifying genes of interest in reference transcriptome assemblies.</p></div>

By simultaneously increasing taxon and gene sampling, phylogenetic inference is expected to improve <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Philippe et al. 2004)</ref> and may help resolve some of the challenges in reconstructing the evolutionary relationships of the Anthozoa and more broadly, phylum Cnidaria.</p><p>For phylogenomic analysis, transcripts larger than 400 bp were converted to protein with TransDecoder and clustered into orthologous groups using FastOrtho. The number of assigned orthologous groups ranged from 14,144 to 21,147 for the four transcriptomes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S1</ref> in File S1). Comparison of all four resulted in 6,560 shared orthologs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure    S1</ref> in File S1). The three coral species shared 2,045 orthologs not found in anemones and the two most closely related corals (M. cavernosa and F. scutaria) shared 1,682 orthologs absent from the other assemblies. By incorporating 11 additional taxa for phylogenomic analysis <ref type="table">(Table S2</ref> in File S1), 443 orthologs were identified between all taxa. After setting a minimum protein length (100 amino acids), these orthologs were refined using the PhyloTreePruner analysis pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kocot et al. 2013)</ref>. Filtering resulted in the identification of 397 orthologs for ≥ 14 taxa. These were used to construct a phylogenetic tree we termed "conservative" because loci with any missing data were excluded <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table S12</ref> in File S7).</p><p>Missing data are a commonly encountered problem in phylogenomic analyses, either from either reduced transcript length or gene absence from a transcriptome <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Philippe et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Kocot et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Roure et al. 2013)</ref>. However, the sensitivity of phylogenetic inference to incomplete datasets is still under investigation, with mixed results from phylogenomic analyses on large, but patchy supermatrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Roure et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Philippe et al. 2004)</ref>. Since the resources in this study used for ortholog identification differed in completeness, ranging from EST libraries to complete genomes <ref type="table">(Table S2</ref> in File S1), we tested the influence of missing data on our phylogenetic reconstruction. To investigate this, we lowered the required number of taxa per orthologous group to ≥ 10, which identified 2,897 orthologs <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table S12</ref> in File S7). This second set was used to create the "relaxed" phylogeny, so called because loci with some missing data were included.</p><p>Both maximum likelihood phylogenomic analyses reconstructed identical and strongly supported topologies (bootstrap = 100; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S2</ref> in File S1), demonstrating that our phylogenetic inference was insensitive to missing data ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>). However, the relationship of the corals in the family Faviidae, containing M. cavernosa, P. strigosa and O. faveolata varied among the COI, ND supergene and phylogenomic analyses. The mitochondrial ND supergene identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Havird et al. (Havird and Santos 2014)</ref> produced a phylogenetic tree nearly synonymous with the accepted cnidarian taxonomic relationships and phylogenomic analyses from this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kitahara et al. 2010)</ref>, except for the placement of the M. cavernosa as sister taxon to O. faveolata and P. strigosa. The analysis of single gene COI, resulted in a discordant phylogenetic topology ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>), failing to reconstruct the complex coral clade (P. asteroides and A. digitifera), which was recovered by ND supergene, relaxed and conserved trees ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S2</ref> in File S1).</p><p>In the COI tree, the placement of the F. scutaria, from the family Fungiidae, as sister taxon to P. strigosa and M. cavernosa from the family Faviidae, instead of O. faveolata is incongruent with current taxonomic placement ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kitahara et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Budd and Stolarski 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, while the phylogenomic analyses placed O. faveolata as sister to P. strigosa with strong support (bootstrap=100), this relationship was not recovered in either mitochondrial phylogeny ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S2</ref> in File S1). Overall, the tree topology from the phylogenomic analyses is consistent with accepted evolutionary relationships within Anthozoa <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Budd and Stolarski 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fukami et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kitahara et al. 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>The annotated transcriptome assemblies developed in this study provide useful resources for genomic research in anthozoan species for which sequences resources were previously lacking. The searchable databases developed from these assemblies make it possible to rapidly identify genes of interest from each species. Our ortholog analysis demonstrates the feasibility of phylogenetic inference in corals using transcriptome assemblies from diverse stages and symbiotic states, highlighting a promising path toward resolving major uncertainties in the existing phylogeny of scleractinians. Future studies will benefit from the growing body of anthozoan sequence resources, including the four assemblies contributed in this study.</p></div>
